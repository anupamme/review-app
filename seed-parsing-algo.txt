Start with the seed words at the leaves level.
Percolate the seed words from the leaves to the root.
At the end of this there will be words at all the nodes.

when parsing a sentence:
1. do pos tagging of the sentence and extract nouns
2. for each noun in the sentence:
    1. find which category the noun belongs to by doing exact match with keywords of that word.
    2. if it belongs to neither of category then find the best category:
        1. find avg of top 3 distance. If it is over a threshhold, pick the category which has max of the distance (max means closer match.)
        2. go down the tree and repeat this process till the noun finds its place in the lowest level.
        
        
Divide the complete dataset into 5 parts.
Run the seed expansion itertively on parts 1 to 5. Measure accuracy on each part and report. Hypothesis is that accuracy should go up.

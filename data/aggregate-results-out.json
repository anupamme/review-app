        "We stayed in a Palace Club Room this time which gave us access to breakfast away from the masses as well as an evening cocktails",
        "Part of the reason we chose this resort is that it is close to the beach and easy access to the Bali Collection area as well, which has a good range of restaurants and shopping in Nusa Dua",

        "Easy walk along beach path to the neighbouring Westin where the conference is hosted",
        "There is a good size balcony, with comfortable chairs, we face a lovely Balinese garden complete with ducks, unfortunately a old cigarette butt had been left uncleared on the balcony which was not good",
        "Wi fi should also be addressed as you could only access it in the club lounge ( not in your room) which is sometimes annoying",

        "As you proceed through the lobby, downstairs is the breakfast buffet, which has an amazing selection of tropical fruit",
        "In the morning the cleaning staff come at 9 o'clock with a several bell rings which seems very inappropriate for me for a holiday resort! Another problem with our sleep was the noise",
        "Another issue was the Internet- free wi-fi only in lobby but very low speed! They offer only cable Internet on a vary high price! You could not use your smartphone on the pool as no wi-fi!",

        "The included breakfast is fantastic with a massive choice of dishes",
        "We arrived at about 3 pm and were told that our room was not yet ready, and that we had to wait for half an hour, which was not that big a deal",

        "Old Nusa Dua is also just 10mins walk which is a small market with more great places to eat",
        "Rooms were the furthest away from the lifts which added extra time to go to and from the hotel rooms which was a bit of a pain, especially in the warm weather",
        "Rooms were very average, and clearly this part of the resort has not yet been renovated",
        "which made sleeping very unpleasant",
        "The hotel has a bank, which is very handy",
        "The standards rooms aren't that great, we quickly upgraded to the palace suite, which was nicer but still didn't have that \"wow\" factor",
        "Which leads to the second gripe",
        "We resisted returning to the Melia Nusa Dua this year having read the recent reviews, which suggested a slip in standards",

        "The air conditioning in the room worked really well which was always welcome when returning to room after hot day",
        "In my opinion, many 5 star hotels got used to high charges but gradually forget about their differentiation and usually they do nothing different than an ordinary hotel which is not expected to offer you much",
        "A lovely arrangement of flowers was in our room and staff all welcomed us with well wishes which was lovely at meals and in the club itself",
        "We were only staying in the deluxe rooms which more than catered for our requirements",
        "We had most meals at the hotel which were incredible",
        "It was nice to be able to walk along the beach via the pathway which goes all the way down to the end of the beach passing all the neighbouring Hotels",
        "We stopped to have a drink & sandwich at the Pirates Cove restaurant which was very nice & very reasonable",

        "We didn't try the other restaurant which had a very enticing menu - perhaps next time",
        "The conference actually used facilities at the Westin and the neighboring Laguna resort, and got to see quite a bit of all three",
        "Nevertheless, note that you are in a closed artificial tourist are which has not a lot to do with the real Bali",
        "Which in case of this resort is worth the money:",
        "I also tried balinese massage which was nice!",
        "If you want to go shopping there is a free shuttle every hour to Bali Collection which we caught with ease (the shopping is only about 5 minutes on the shuttle if that) and the hotel also has a nightly market that sets up which is good for souvineery stuff",
        "Yes, new bed is the keyword",
        "We stayed in a Deluxe room which was perfect",
        "Although in saying this when we stayed we paid $150 AUD per night for a deluxe room which is now around $236 per night",
        "Rooms were fixed too, new flat screens, new furnitures, our suite had table and 4 chairs, chairs are funny, when sit you have to held hands high to be able to eat, luckly there is pillows with they help on chair can eat",
        "Our fav part of the day was spent here",
        "Our greatest issue was probably the cost of actually being at the resort",
        "They did our washing for 2000Rp per piece (about 20 cents) which worked out less than 10% what the hotel charges",
        "A conference at the nearby conference centre brought me to this hotel",
        "Tranquility was high on my radar and after a quick and pleasant check in I was shown to my room which was on the second level",
        "I also booked a hotel car to take me back to the airport after the conference ended",
        "I will definitely return to this hotel on pleasure grounds next time - and try out the club facilities which looked rather special",
        "The issue is the pricing of the food and drink together with the location",

        "There is live music three nights a week which is nice and romantic",
        "There are two pools and we preferred to swim in the older pool which has a sand bottom and was very relaxing",

        "We aslo visited the Club lounge for the complimenary coctails which were great and served with small bites to eat which were delicious",
        "Both of our rooms came with a balcony that overlooked the pool and garden area which was great",
        "So there were no shortage of eateries",
        "The beachfront is furnished with comfortable lounge chairs and there is never a shortage of luxurious purple beach towels",
        "(1) Each time you ask the concierge service to call you cab they \"assume\" that you mean a hotel cab which costs about USD 5",
        "We felt very bitter and cheated when we realised that each time you ask them to call you a cab they give you their hotel taxi which charges a ridiculous fare - for the same type of car or driver of a regular taxi!!! I am surprised that nobody has picked up on this",
        "There was a cultural performnce by some kid dancers, which was quite cute, but totally under-sold and run by totally incompetent staff",
        "The accommodation we booked was beautiful with rooms well maintained and clean, even the small details such as a clothes line above the bath was included - which was very handy for wet swimmers! The grounds were beautifully kept and huge",
        "We used the gym and squash courts while here which were all well maintained",
        "With the exception of a slightly messy check in- there was little to fault",
        "3 out of 4 rooms were beautiful, overlooking the pool and garden, whilst the other room was further from ours and was overlooking a garden (which was still nice, but not as nice as ours)",
        "However when we asked if we could be together they were very helpful in changing the room to one next to ours the next day - which was great",
        "3) the mini bar is expensive (which they always are but there is no space to store your own water which is a shame)",
        "When we went out on the verandah we overlooked a fire hydrant and the exhaust fans from the adjacent hotet which wasn't very pleasant",
        "The staff were nice and friendly and there was a shuttle that went to the Bali Collection (which was veru touristy though!) Buffet breakfast was included in our room price - whcih was plentiful and nice",
        "There is a private beach, just for the hotel guest, which is very nice",
        "We stayed for 8 days & tried all the restaurants on site & all were good but my favourite has to be the pizzeria which is in the middle of the complex right next to the swimming pools",
        "The nights were very quiet, however, we could hear the people above us walking around their room in the middle of the night, as well as a wedding party singing around the pool late until 1am, which was near our room",
        "We enjoyed a couple's romance package at the Spa, which was fabulous",
        "24hour juices and soft drinks are also included",
        "Out the hotel there are local restaurants which are well worth a visit and easier on the pocket, by far",
        "We were there for the Commonwealth Tennis Exhibition held in Westin, which is right next door of Nusa Dua Beach Beach Hotel",
        "We checked him and glad to know that he's alright with a small bump on his head",
        "It seems that the lock on the crib is loose and were opened by itself due to the shaking and jiggling",
        "The shuttle bus is free and handy to visit the Bali collection shopping mall just down the road which has many branded shops along with a good selection of restaurants to cater for all tastes",
        "I was staying in a deluxe room, which is not too big",
        "Bathrooms very small,but with big shower heads which spills off the side of bath",
        "Thankful there was a free shuttle service to Bali Collection which offered many retaurants & shops much cheaper",
        "We had stayed in Sanur before staying in Nusa Dua and found the level of English spoken here was much lower and at times another staff member had to assist",
        "Our room was lovely and we were given a complimentary upgrade which was a nice touch",
        "Now a warning - I went by myself to jet ski which is offered through the hotel but done through an off site company",
        "Kids club is also free, which is a nice added extra",
        "- The hotel taxi service is about 200% more expensive than walking out the front of the hotel and flagging down a Blue Cab (which are very safe and clean, etc)",
        "I walked down to a local tour agent out the front gate and I got the same tour for $40, which was brilliant",
        "From the gardeners to the managers, all unfailingly polite, friendly and helpful and for the most part, efficient",
        "Plenty of room, two bathrooms, two cots and rollaway bed in the living room which could be closed off from the main bedroom",
        "Enormous - we actually ended up either sharing one between two or ordered the kids meals which were about a normal sized adult meal in our world! The pizzas were excellent - far better than anticipated in an asian country",
        "Which brings me to",
        "We were keen to eat out at lots of the great restauarants but the vast majority that we wanted to go to were in the Seminyak area, which was a long round trip drive (45 mins each way usually) each night",
        "We were disappointed with our deluxe room so upgraded to a premium room which was perfect",
        "- Beautiful grounds which are immaculately kept by an army of staff",
        "Price was standard for any hotel in the area, which is a little less than western pricing but expensive for Bali",
        "Internet is expensive which in this day and age is a down side",
        "The Spa and the relaxing pool area is to die for (Ask for big spa area for massage which is normally reserved for couples but is much nicer)",
        "In the afternoon we were given two hours of afternoon tea which included finger sandwiches, freshly baked scones with jam and whipped cream and choice of drink (non-alcoholic)",
        "When we arrived at the hotel our bags were all sorted and carried for us and upon checking in we were upgraded which was very nice",
        "The room was equipped with a fridge that was of a small but decent size and doubled as the minibar (which was expensive)",
        "The hotel however also has a small 25m Lap Pool which is available until 10pm, no under 12s allowed in this area too",
        "The only saving grace are the staff which are very pleasant",
        "Nusa Dua treats Honeymoon Couples with a comfort and care which speaks for finest hospitality to Guests",
        "In addition to this , the Bath Tub gave away a rich aroma of fresh rose petals which were a visual delight !!",
        "Nusa Dua Resort also provides timely pick up and drops at specified timings throughout the Day to the local Mall - \"Bali Collection\" which boasts of abundant eateries covering mostly all major cuisines of the world",
        "Not to forget, we also have the welcome drink at the lobby, which is also awesome to enjoy and start your journey there",
        "First night we stayed at Superior room which is old unrenovated room",
        "It is definitely worth paying the extra for Palace Club which covers full breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails and nibbles",
        "We have just returned from our third visit to this hotel, staying Palace Club, some rooms and suites of which have just been completely refurbished",
        "We were accommodated in one of the un-furbished superior rooms, which was quirky and had everything needed",
        "There is renovations going on which were annoying to hear an angle grinder running all day and well into the night",
        "They have just appointed a new Executive Chef who I believe is a Australian who I am sure will keep the high standards of food being offered, lets hope he reviews the offering of some of the menu's and as a suggestion add a variety of fresh Subs or Sandwiches for lunch menu which are a great option on a hot day",
        "The cooking class at Raja's is a must but dont eat breakfast that morning!! 5min walk to Shopping Mall and local villages for shopping and eating",
        "Ate a few nights at Bali Collection which is a shopping area close by within walking distance or use the shuttle provided",
        "I took the Delux Spa Package which gave me a deluxe room, spa treatment of one hour which was divine and return airport transfers",
        "The water bottles are not included in the hotel price, which with regard that you cannot drink tap water is very cheap",
        "From the onset the staff provided amazing service which was friendly, helpful and efficient",
        "I could go on about the resort, beach and food, which were all amazing! But what I think was most memorable about the place where the staff",
        "Each evening the canapes are based on a theme, which is really nice",
        "Main pool areas as described, no obvious problems with sun lounger availability but we tended to go later in the afternoon",
        "Surely, a 5 star hotel would have been more prepared to handle such thunderstorms, which is not even close to a tsunami!",
        "The accommodation blocks stretch back from the beach and rise to four floors which might be the legal limit",
        "We left just as the main pool was closing, which would be something of a disadvantage, but the second pool was still available, as well as the children's areas",
        "There's a million things I could write but it's better you discover them yourself (if you want more info about hotel, read the review I wrote last year which is more detailed)",
        "For a greater variety of local food try the restaurants at the \"Nusa Dua Gates\" which are a leisurely 5 minutes walk from the hotel",
        "The wedding itself, was very well organised and took place in a marble floored gazebo overlooking the beach, which had been decorated absolutely beautifully",
        "We didn't eat in the resort but ate at Bali Collection which is about a 15min walk or a free shuttle bus away",
        "Visited the neighbouring hotels which are all connected by a jogging trail",
        "We were fortunate enough to receive an upgrade to a suite which was absolutely magnificient",
        "We tended to walk outside the Nusa Dua gates and eat in the local restaurants which were much cheaper",
        "The breakfast buffet was fairly extensive but had the same exact selections day after day which became pretty boring after the sixth day",
        "That being said, we still had a very good stay without any problems which is good",
        "The rooms are very nice, they maintain some Balinese style so are pleasant to stay in - most have balconies which is another plus",
        "The complex has a number of tourist restaurants which are alot more affordable",
        "I asked for an additional pillow and it smelt of smoke, which was a little off putting",
        "The best part is the staff",
        "We had a balcony which overlooked the garden",
        "The included breakfast was really good",
        "The hotel has 2 pools, a main pool and a lagoon pool which are both lovely",
        "HOTEL: When I called the hotel to say we were celebrating an anniversary, they upgraded our room which was very nice",
        "For 15 dollars you can rent a gazebo on or near the beach which is also great",
        "Breakfast is the usual asian buffet which was nice and fresh and changed alternate days",
        "SPA was very relaxing although is now moved to club rooms instead of spa villa which is under refurbishment for the next three months",
        "The other not so positive issue was the price of the meals inside the Hotel comparing with the prices outside",
        "Wont be able to comment much on food quality as we were roaming around and hardly had any meals at the hotel (except breakfast - which is decent)",
        "We went to Sekar Jagat which is a 5 min drive - $60US for 3 hrs of pampering & return transfers to the hotel",
        "Had 1 Balinese massage which was good",
        "Closer to the hotel we tried a restaurant outside the gates called Tropicana which was very reasonable",
        "Also if you do venture out of the hotel to find restaurants, many of the offer transfers to and from your hotel, which is great!",
        "On arrival we where given a voucher for a mock cocktail which was a nice touch",
        "The room was a good size and we had a lovely view on to the Duck pond from the balcony which had two chairs and a table",
        "Each room has daily toiletries, safe, water and a turn down service which was around 5",
        "The hotel has 4 restaurants which we enjoyed other than the pizza one which was not good",
        "We also had room service which was excellent",
        "There's a path that you can walk along the beach from hotel to hotel which is great",
        "Also alongside these pools is a children's pool which is smaller and shallower",
        "Cons: only thing i have to flaw which isn't due to the hotel was the cocktails",
        "They also have a great kids menu which our 2yr old and 11yr old loved",
        "However, if you want a good choice of dining take the shuttle (free) which runs hourly from the main desk to Bali Collection which is a shopping mall within Nusa Dua suburb",
        "The hotel has a large lobby area which leads through to the centre which is all pools and restaurants and surrounded by the rooms either side",
        "The breakfast buffet in the",
        "We complained the staff the following morning and were shown another room which was the same, I explained to the hotel staff the problem again and we were then shown another room which was fine",
        "There is also the Bali Collection shopping centre in Nusa Dua which is great to visit for lunch and a bit of shopping, the hotel operates a free shuttle bus there every hour, or you can walk which will take about 15 mins",
        "We had a superior room facing the garden, which was a good size and decorated in a traditional balinese style",
        "The hotel facilities were excellent, we used the gym which was well equipped and very well air conditioned! The whole spa area is a peaceful haven away from the rest of the hotel and I reccomend the loungers around the lap pool for a lovely quiet spot to read a book",
        "A fully fledged games area at the Spa which is superb for adults and teenagers",
        "A whole buffet would cost about $30 which is hardly expensive by international standards",
        "We paid around USD$130 per night which is not expensive at all by international standards for a resort of this quality",
        "We stayed in a Palace Club room on the honeymoon in paradise package which included many extras such as dinner in the very below average Raja's restaurant",
        "After 2 days complaining about waking up each morning covered in bites they did change the mattress & pillows which stopped the problem",
        "The restaurants & bars are quite expensive & not very good quality, with the exception of the Japanese restaurant, which served good sushi",
        "The quality of the food is excellent at whichever restaurant you dine at and I would recommend that you try Rajas which specialises in Balinese cuisine",

        "The stretch of beach where the resort is located accommodates 5-6 other 4-5 star nice resorts, but they are all south of it, and they dont benefit as much from the sea breeze as it does, which is very important on a hot & humid Bali afternoon with a beer or cocktail in hand",
        "There are the locals on the beach (they are not allowed to enter the resort property) every day, all day, to barter with for imitation Rolex watches and Bolle sunnies, baik linen & clothing and so on, which is a fun experience",
        "The shower was large and the bathtub had both a fixed faucet and the hand held type which became very important in the second half of the trip",
        "Our wedding went without and a hitch and the location was stunning, we used the wedding bale on the beach front, which was surprisingly private",
        "They also set up some personal wedding props, a speaker system, a mike and a dance stage which allowed for speeches, the waltzes and some booty shaking",

        "Good facilities at fitness center, great tennis court for very reasonable money - and the one which is dry even right after the rain",
        "Breakfast: plenty of food, the only disadvantage is the menu which is 90% the same day after day",
        "The second minus - this is a hotel, even the resort consisting of 90% of Russians - which sometimes gets very tiring",
        "And yes, the best part of the holiday beyond the property is the staff",
        "After a lot of careful research I picked this hotel as the location for our wedding because it was one of the few places I could find where we could get married and see the sea, which was my dream",
        "As it was our wedding we pushed the boat out and booked a palace club suite which had all the benefits of being a palace club member which were worth the extra cost",
        "The setting was gorgeous, candle lit and full silver service with our own waiter etc, they even sent over a trio of musicians which was awesome! I'm pretty sure the gourmet restaurant there is Raja's, superb food and service!",
        "Stayed at the palace club room which gives you all the extra free-bees, and its worth the extra money",
        "The hotel needs to be upgraded technologically, The Tv's were old and the in room wifi meant purchasing a pre paid wifi card from the gift shop",
        "Ask them to call in a 'meter taxi' , which are so much cheaper than the hotel's own",
        "The lagoon has built in seating areas which were very welcome",
        "The seafood was much better value- it included lobster and fillet steak, which were excellent",
        "We had dinner which was poor quality and over priced",
        "We stayed in a Palace Room which well appointed, good size and great attention to detail by the room attendants",
        "Because of this we had a large balcony which was great to sit on at night and have a few drinks - don't forget spray for mosquitos though! The bathroom was clean, there was a shower over the bath and a toilet in the bathroom, outside the bathroom was the sink",
        "The rooms come with bathrobes, slippers and umbrellas, there is also an electronic safe which was perfect for us",
        "There was a Bali Collection Shopping Precinct which was a short stroll up the road (less than 10 minutes)",
        "If you walk or catch a Taxi out of the main gates there are lots of wonderful restaurants there which are so much cheaper than in the Nusa Dua area",
        "There is also a market area out the front of the middle gate, which was handy",
        "There is also the Bali Collection which is a 10 min walk but during the day which can be quite hot, we caught a taxi which wasnt much at all",
        "There is a few restaurants there which looked nice and clean and a Starbucks too",
        "A supermarket which was handy to stock up on bottled water and bits n pieces",
        "There is no shuttle bus in the hotel and nusa dua area, except a shuttle to Bali Collection, which runs every 1 hour till 10pm",
        "They are very instructive and helpful and there is a great wreck towads the north of the island which is definatley worth a visit",
        "The first half of our trip we stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel (was part of a really great package deal with Asia Luxe/Singapore Airlines)",
        "Blacony also pleasant with nice chairs",
        "One small usual problem which i didnt expect was that you have the same old problem of getting sunbeds round the pool, and as there was only about three familys of the usual suspects at this resort, (you know who i mean ) i guess this is now a world wide problem which cant be labelled at one particular nation",
        "We had a massive Jacuzzi bathtub which beside it there was louvered doors which could be opened into the bedroom",
        "A large TV and Unit, which incorporated our fridge fully stocked with water, soft drinks, alcoholic drinks and snacks",
        "This included breakfast, afternoon tea (which comprised of scones, pastries, sandwiches etc), soft drinks and tea and coffee",
        "It's big and impersonal and sadly lacking in balanese charm which was a real plus with the other two hotels",
        "Would recommend this hotel to all groups as something for everyone",
        "They had a parque flooring which reminded me of home",
        "We got a good deal on a room, and the included buffet breakfast was mind-blowingly comprehensive",
        "Moreover we stayed in the palace club which was even more fantastic",
        "The overall experience is rather average, the receptionist was not friendly till we were told that we got the Palace Club rooms, which had its own reception area; most of the staff there are friendly and helpful, but a bit too slow sometimes",
        "We went out to Kuta and zoo and monkey mountain which was quite fun",
        "Most of the local drivers are familiar with the hotel which is a bonus especially when arranging transport to and from spas, restaurants and other destinations",
        "No complimentary afternoon tea which is quite common elsewhere",
        "These are very big a spacious room, which was a bit of a waste for a person travelling by themselves",
        "Our room rate included breakfast which was of the normal standard of a hotel of this type, plenty of choice",
        "When we got there we were upgraded to a suite which was like a little apartment - fantastic!",
        "My only reservation would be the price of eating and drinking there all day every day, so I would recommend going out into the town- there are just as many lovely places to go there, and you can save your money for some scuba diving or sightseeing to the volcano, which can all be arranged through the hotel and are definitely worth making the effort to leave the gorgeous hotel surroundings for!",
        "The beach itself is not great, the sand stripe is quite narrow, and the seabed full of rocks and seaweed",
        "Glass bottom boats and snorkelling are available from the beach, which was white sand and very clean",
        "There are other restaurants in the nearby village and also in Jimbaran which provide transport to and from the hotel",
        "We booked an island tour with the hotel Tours desk which was in a private car just for the two of us with a driver and guide",
        "The beach sports facilities were not free, which was disappointing",
        "If you do stay here, make sure to go to Tropical and Bumbu Bali restaurants, which are located outside of the hotel complexes",
        "The sports facilities were always available and not busy, which was great",
        "The hotel was quite big with traditional architecture and ornaments which are cool",
        "We stayed in one of the Palace Club rooms, which was furnished in traditional Balinese style and had everything we needed, including doors out onto a patio area which looked out over the impressive gardens",
        "The two pools on the complex are not huge considering the number of rooms, but as the hotel seemed to be no more than 2/3 full whilst we were there we never found this a problem",
        "Having said that, a top tip is to go and find the Lap Pool over next to the Spa, which was almost empty compared to the main pool",
        "We have just returned from staying at the Nusa Dua and although our experience ultimately turned out to be a good one, there were some problems",
        "Our suite was good though and the senior staff did listen to our qualms and must be credited highly on acting upon them and providing us with a series of \"treats\" which were delightfully unexpected",
        "Strongly recommend this resort which is the only one in Balinese style there",
        "Driver was waiting to pick us up at the airport (offered as part of the additional benefits package), which was a great start to the 7 night stay",
        "We booked the Palace suite with the Club advantages which are a blast and well worth it",
        "The rooms are clean and comfortable and our superior rooms had a balcony which overlooked the gardens and ocean",
        "There is also another poolside bar and restaurant which serves drinks and lunch by your lounger!",

        "com), which gave us a wonderful tour tailored to our preferences at a competitive price",
        "They just have to do one small change & that is to their pool which looks slightly outdated",
        "We had a superior room, which was nice and spacious enough",
        "Nusa Dua is a very strange resort, it is beautiful and impeccably clean, there are large ornamental gates to the resort which is essentially just several high quality hotels down a nice stretch of beach",
        "As a rule we like to leave our hotel, go for a stroll and pop into a few bars/restaurants etc, there is very little around nusa dua at all and as the weather wasn't great when we were there we felt a bit bored, though it is cheap and easy to get taxis to jimbaran kuta etc and excursions to ubud etc are also cheap and you will get private tours and your own guides which is great",
        "We also had a massage in a hut looking out at the ocean which was bliss",
        "The drains were smelly and noisy",
        "Then we would walk on the walkway which extends along the beach",
        "We also explored the Hyatt which seemed even more manufactured",
        "Furthermore it was quite obvious that the hotel works with numerous travelagencies who seem to be offering last minutes as well, which was reflected by the general standing of the guests",
        "The Palace Club is worth the extra money which includes afternoon tea with sandwiches, cakes and then cocktails in the evening with hors d'oeuvres",
        "1) Barely half of the staff speak English which is weird for a leading hotel though,",
        "We had a Family Room (Superior Room) for 4, which consisted of 2 rooms with an interconnecting door",

        "The hotel had employed a professional from the UK to train the bar staff on cocktail making (the espresso martinis were amazing!) The drinks were a little expensive but what some people fail to realise is that this is a five star resort and it is expensive to drink in a lot of places in Bali as they have to import (a bottle of Jacobs creek in a local supermarket set me back $70)",

        "Has 4 swimming pools and 5 restaurants",
        "Pools & beach are beautiful & relaxing",

        "Internet access is available free of charge as well, soft drinks are available free at any time in the Palace Club lounge",
        "My Recommedation is to book the club package - it is great value and the alcoholic drinks keep flowing in the cocktail hours",

        "The sun lounges were in a good position and were always available",

        "Witnessed a couple of instances of disputes between guests over sun lounges around the pools which I think would be easily remedied by maybe getting some hour glass sand timers or something like that so you had only a 1 hour window to leave your chairs unattended so someone else could use them",
        "Same goes for the adults with limited fresh salads or vegetables",

        "The shop in the hotel sold soft drinks however they were also extremely expensive (they didn't even sell ice creams)",

        "We went on a couple of trips out, and the hotel will kindly book a taxi for you and you pay the hotel direct, which saves haggling, but you will pay over the odds for this, but these were small people carriers as opposed to minicabs",
        "Definitely will recommend the hotel, but hope that they pay more attention to the first impression given to guest from arrival to check in",
        "Some things at the hotel make you scratch your head, for example the hotel has a great breakfast buffet spread, yet you have to scramble to find your own table, search to find your own high chair, you aren't offered any tea or coffee and if you aren't randomly asked halfway through your breakfast and ask a staff member, they seem confused and need to be asked 3 or 4 times before doing anything!",

        "hotel is located on a lovely beach which is kept clean by hotel staff, the other thing is your trapped in the resort unless you order a taxi to take you into town, if you want peace and quite and happy to lie around the pool all day than this place is fine",
        "The hotel is amazing and we enjoyed the traditional style that they have maintained",
        "The beach might as well be non existent as when the moon isn't full the tide is so far out, all you get is 500 meters of mangroves with sea urchins",
        "Forget toast and because although great marmalade and jams they have no idea of toast (unless you like conrete consistency)",
        "The new national golf course is awesome but expensive",
        "But people are the difference and the culture is set at the top management",
        "The people who served us were so friendly and lovely and the two massages I had were so relaxing and reviving",
        "but they should include the taxes and service fees in the prices in advance",
        "The Staff there are excellent",
        "They made our 50th Wedding Anniversary one to remember",
        "What a wonderful place Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa was Our stay was so relaxing and enjoyable",

        "people will have a relaxed start in the day and not that trouble",
        "Was sad to leave this place but had too",
        "Our only problems were our airport transfer did not arrive and we had to make our own way to the hotel and the pools are lovely but because people put their towels out on the chairs really early in the morning and reserve them for the day, its impossible to get a chair after about 8",
        "This needs to be addresssed by the hotel as there would be enough to go around if they were controlled more effectively",
        "The pool could be empty and you still can't get a chair as people leave their things there and then just come and go thru the day as they please",
        "For a hotel established in the 80's this place is certainly keeping up with the times while maintaining the traditional Balinese feel with amazing structures and gardens",
        "Good range of restaurants including a variety of specialty dinners with Balinese dances, good spa, lovely grounds and swimming pools",
        "However they have no problem in people drinking their own alcohol",
        "You know this feeling when you see fotos of your hotel and after arriving you recognize that these were made nice to cover the disaster of the hotel?",
        "The Hotel Spa has the best prices in the area (these are simply fair)",
        "All of the Hotel restaurants have a very good menu and the qualtiy is although very good",
        "A suggestion for improvement would be to have a system allocating pool beds to everyone as it is a little annoying when people leave their towels to reserve pool beds from early morning until sunset",
        "So I would recommend staying at the Hotel but just be warned that food & drinks are more expensive than what they are in Australia",
        "Ensure that you stroll along the beach, get a massage and if you want indulge a million activities they arrange",
        "If you want to, they have a recreational room with a lot of options",
        "We heard feed back from other Nusa Dua guests that they were not good",
        "They have some funny squirrels jumping on your balcony",
        "They all spoke English very well",
        "A special thanks to the assistant Palace Club manager Nyoman Sadnyana very helpful and friendly, great butler service from Ayu and all the others in this area they seem to be hand picked for your own requirements",
        "They were great for the kids! The beach was fairly nice,but the sand was large and hard on the feet",
        "My husband and i absolutely loved them!",
        "The surroundings are tranquil, the gardens are beautiful and as nature lovers you have the Nusa Dua family of ducks that are a great source of entertainment to watch as well as the cheeky squirrels that every morning greet you and pretty much frolic around the palm trees occasionally landing on your patio where they are quite happy to gently take a grape or two from you",
        "they even have beach cleaners",
        "Not pleased with it AT ALL",
        "We are hoping they will try to fix this problem, because its such a shame, the hotel is beautiful, people are very friendly, but they need to upgrade their service to the clients",
        "I was very grateful to them when they helped out with questions about transport and local amenities",
        "Another con we found in the shopping centre is being approached by sellers telling you about a new hotel (the best in Bali apparently ;) ) that they are advertising",
        "they won't bother you again",
        "The team were very tolerant in us having some of the cocktails closer to our room after they had gone to bed",
        "They only only went a couple of times and really didn't want to go back",
        "Had a trio band playing covers at the restaurants every night, they were very entertaining",
        "Only tip would be if you want a bed at the pool you have to get in early, seems like most people grabbed towels and reserved beds before going to breakfast, so get in early",
        "Staff were friendly enough but very rigid in what they understood the rules to be",
        "My only gripe about this hotel (and its not just this hotel either-they all seem the same in Nusa Dua) is they lack atmosphere during the day and night",
        "The Palace Club was jist like coming home the service by the staff was excellent and they never forget you",
        "We went there as a family with an 11, 16 and 18 year old and they all had a ball in the pool and beach",
        "The breakfast was a real hit with the buffet as the older two are boys and they eat a lot! We were able to skip lunch most days because of the big breakfasts",
        "They had a female pianist for a couple of evenings a week whose singing and playing was positively soporific",
        "They have good quality of bread and good coffee",
        "When confronted with this they apologized and discounted it",
        "Children in the Palace Club were a distraction and whilst we love children do not want them chasing around",
        "all people try always to comfort your life",
        "They have a nice fitness room, tennis and squash fields and beautiful and clean pool's",
        "They have a happy hour from 5 till 7 pm near the pools",
        "They also give u vouchers to use to discount food and drinks",
        "Although I talked as clearly and slowly as I could, and they repeated it back, they still stuffed up our order every single time! It was difficult to feed fussy kids because the staff had limited flexibility",
        "Our grandchildren loved the Kids Club and we felt safe leaving them there",
        "staff all fantastic",
        "For us personally, I am glad we didn't take the Palace Club option, whilst it looks beautiful and the tranquil duck pond side of the resort is gorgeous, we prefer a little action and \"people watching\" and found the pool side to be a little livelier whilst not being too busy or noisy at all",
        "The treatments were heavenly, professional and again this is so well organised that you feel you are a vip guest alone, despite the number of treatments they must manage to provide for so many",
        "The shows accompanying the dinners were also excellent and all in all well worth doing",
        "Bali collection is better than many people suggest in our opinion",
        "I strongly suggest that management secretly try the fare they offer and draw their own conclusion",
        "Either than that, all was very good",
        "One of the outstanding aspects is the high calibre of the staff, they are very helpful, always welcoming and do it with a smile",
        "Ok the most people make the reservation early in the morning, sometime nobody come to use this seats",

        "The only negative - there was a bad smell in the bathroom when we arrived but they attended to this issue as well",
        "My suggestion to management is that they seriously consider having a place for the guests to dance with some good music",
        "People enjoy dancing and the atmosphere at the resort is a great environment for people to dance the night away",
        "The NDBHS was pretty standard for a Nusa Dua resort, very extensive grounds with lots of facilities, a little bit worn, belying the age of the place",
        "The resort's massages were fantastic even though they were free as part of out package deal",
        "Get in early to secure your sun lounges around the pool - people \"reserve\" their lounges early by placing their towels on them and then coming back to them hours later!",

        "Don't miss the high tea hour where they serve tea/coffee/juices and a whole platter of sweets and savory for free!(plus you can ask for more!) And at night come down and drink some cocktails in cocktail hour, serving a range of alcohol/non-alcohol drinks and some small bites(everyday the small bites change)",
        "The place was bursting full",
        "One night we sat at the Chess Bar and watched a waiter bring back a glass of Rose and a glass of Red that had obviously been incorrectly ordered, The Rose was poured back in to the bottle and the Red sat under the counter for around 60 mins and was then taken out to another patron witnessing this just about made my blood boil as it is very costly to purchase food and drinks here and you would hope that they were FRESH!!",
        "We couldn't pick a favourite amongst them as they all offer excellent cuisine",
        "It has an open-plan kitchen and we chatted with the chefs as they were preparing mouth-watering regional dishes",
        "They were happy to demonstrate their skills and offer advice regarding the preparation and cooking methods that they employ",
        "The cocktails on the drinks menu are worth a mention too; packed with fresh tropical fruits, they are difficult to ignore!",
        "30 and saw only a few people",
        "With our package we had lots of options for free meals, we did find that if you were more adventurous with your choice is was a bit bland but with so many tastes to cater for I suppose they err on the side of caution",
        "We took full advantage of the free spa treatments and they were brilliant",
        "After explaining our situation yet again we were then apparently given a room upgrade and by around 10am the room transfer had taken place",
        "Things like our shower gel, shampoo, conditioner etc were not replaced daily even though they were empty or nearly so",
        "We stayed at the hotel as a large group and the overall comments from our group is that they had a great experience, with just some minor issues here and there",
        "The place is dusty, dirty and needs a total re-vamp",
        "looking forwarded to returning to Bali but never again to this place",
        "If you like to experience, traditional Balinese Dances, they have 3 great theme nights a week, serving the most sumptuous buffet dinners",
        "They are polite and absolutely loveable",
        "I commend to the Hotel Management, Kadek Rasni - such a beautiful, kind soul for whom nothing was too much trouble, Walyi (a lovely lady, whose name I can't spell), again, she went out of her way - very gracious, Anik - she possessed excellent PR skills and with a wonderful sense of humor and Fedelia - great problem solving skills, although, absolutely ALL of the female staff were excellent",

        "On the plus side, staff were friendly - as they seem always to be in Bali",
        "Totally loved the place!! Amazing location",
        "Just hope they add a little more to their menu in terms of indian food or vegetarian options",
        "In my opinion there needs to be a mix",
        "Staff definitely greet you whenever they see you",
        "It looks more like a compulsion as if they have been told to do so",
        "Where to start in reviewing this amazing place? We got so much out of our stay at this beautiful hotel, we didnt want to leave and we can't wait to go back",
        "Many people we met return to the hotel every year, such is its magic",
        "Unlike many other beaches in Bali plus there is an abundance of water sports at reasonable rates for them to engage in",

        "It's older than others in the area but with this comes some great Bali feel and design",
        "Fun was had feeding the squirrels when they came to our balcony",
        "If you want a quieter place set in manicured gardens and traditional Bali architecture then this place will do the job nicely",
        "As soon as we get inside of the room, we could listen to all the conversations in the other room, and they were just talking normally",
        "There are a few restaurants and bars that we tried, but it should be improved compared with the price that they were charging",
        "Not good at all",
        "Same applies for the hotel",
        "Constant landscapers on duty -people raking the sand/ picking up leaves to keep the yards and beach tidy which you can imagine leaves the place immaculate!",
        "Supardmi, are both exceptional but all the staff in the club are so efficient and professional they always go the extra mile, they truly are an asset to this resort",
        "What a fantastic place to stay",

        "We did unfortunately not receive our fast track through customs and immigration as they blamed a third party",
        "The drinks are awesome and they have a very nice collection of different types of tea",
        "They have multiple restaurants on the property",
        "We had the most relaxing massages, evening cocktails, breakfast and dinner ( with a show) all included",

        "The staff made you feel like nothing was too much trouble and they just accommodated to our every need",

        "We kept going back to the Chess Restaurant because we were so in love with the staff - they were always so friendly and attentive",
        "I would highly recommend this resort, the staff are genuinely happy and friendly and will do anything they can to help you in any way",
        "When we first arrived, the place looked amazing, very big and quite majestic",
        ") Staff don't have great english, we just came from Amadea Resort in Seminyak and this place has nothing on them",
        "They are all looking a bit shabby for a 4 star hotel",
        "Nusa Dua does not allow many sales people on their private beach & sellers do pay a premium to have the chance to seel to guests, this means they do not haggle as hard as they pay to be there also",
        "The only issue we had was some noise whilst trying to sleep, it is a big hotel so there is always someone around the place",
        "Many staff have worked here for many years (one of my therapists told me she had been there for 20 years) which is also a testament to their ethos & how they care for their staff",
        "nothing is too much trouble and they can't do enough for you",
        "All beautifully kept",
        "I wouldn't recommended the bali dance theme night, the food was of poor quality, and the dancing was laughable",
        "Nearby shops do overcharge vs normal parts of Bali - they cater to \"wealthy\" - so catch a taxi to buy at normal prices",
        "Upon arrival we took an upgrade package which included a larger, nicer room overlooking the duck pond and beautiful gardens, ala carte breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails, all served in a seperate dining area (from the main dining room) overlooking the duck pond",
        "Didn't actually try any of these as we like to eat out, but they all looked very nice",
        "You also dont see many other people as most people have standard rooms",
        "They often do more than expected to make your stay nice and comfortable",
        "We asked to be moved to another room and they did that without any hesitation",
        "I enjoyed the private beach very much and due the time we went, there weren't many people at all! it was amazing and relaxing!",
        "Also I must mention they were quite arrogant and rude",
        "I must say they were not Balinese! Apart from this group of arrogant chiefs who are only contracted on and might not be there for long, this place was fantastic",
        "People were walking around and looking for their own tables instead of being lead to their tables, I am unsure if they are short staffed",
        "If they are then they shouldn't be holding buffets",
        "They have a compliemntary professional photograph taken aginst a picturesque backdrop",
        "We were both checking in to the same class of room - the suites, so don't know why they couldn't finish our check in first??",
        "They are not quick with service",
        "With all the people on the beach and around the pool, they need to think about a roving waiter or two",
        "They are helpful with taxis and tours",
        "It was delivered a few minutes later when I pushed the (minor) matter (though a whisper and snide comment passed between them)",

        "They are quiet, beautifully landscaped and maintained",
        "Plumbing and aircon all worked as they should",
        "I really don't mind few hanging around because I love what they sell",
        "All in all, the experience was absolutely faultless",
        "Also it is only a 10-15 minute walk from Bali collections where you can enjoy hassle free shopping and great food at the many restaurants( but the hotel also has 5 ) in a clean environment and the international hospital ( for peace of mind ) and golf course are literally across the road",
        "I was at this resort last year, People are very friendly,We stay together with our families they come from Sydney and Perth",
        "Good entertainment at night in the lobby such as live singer and piano player",
        "All of them were perfect for different things",
        "We asked at our reception where we could go to get to Nusa Dua town and they suggested an outdoor shopping strip or the markets",
        "They have beautiful voices, a good sense of humour and take song requests",
        "The other problem that stems from this is that while there is a pricey bill at the end, you will also lose money from tipping, which if you feel for the human condition of Balinese people its kind of essential to tip and they deserve it because they work hard",
        "So, all in all, everything is excellent!",
        "Had lunch at their cafe by the beach and got served by 3 different waiters, none could understand what we ordered (it wasn't like we wanted them to cook something special for us, we just pointed at two things on the menu and they still got them wrong",
        "Would like to stay there again in the future",
        "It was only a few days later that The Guest Relations representatives reached out to me to see how they could help make his day as memorable as possible",
        "Being next to westin hotel, they cleverly maintained traditional identity in costumes food and presentation",
        "^^ and you can see a lot of cute squirels, they not disturbing us, they just curious to saw us like us to they",
        ":D even they crossing at your balcony",
        "They have 3 kind of pool",
        "Bathrooms are tiny and although the fixtures seem to be new it looks like they just put the new fixtures in a badly designed bathroom",
        "Bali convention mall is close by and they have regular shuttles from here",
        "They were more than happy to hold our luggage for us all day",
        "Concierge and Bell Staff tried to arrange transportation/trips for me that were SO much more expensive than they should be",
        "They prey on the \"first timers\" to Bali don't be fooled! One of the worst things is the lack of Internet",
        "The wired internet works fine and they provide a cable",
        "Luckily, during my stay they were about to release turtles to the sea",
        "People are friendly and serves with a warm heart especially the housekeeping team",
        "Brilliant how they have an inviting desk with visitors chairs set aside for Client Relations adjacent to the reception area",
        "There are numerous restaurants in the area and they will all pick you up from the hotel and drop you home",
        "We stayed in Nusa Dua after first scuba diving in Permuteran and then having a few days in Ubud, thereby seeing the \"real \" Bali, so when we arrived at the Nusa Dua hotel we were a bit taken aback at first by it being such a huge \"touristy \" resort ( beautiful decor ) We had booked a Deluxe family room with interleading rooms but they upgraded us to a triple room , at no extra cost, as they must have made a mistake with assigning rooms",
        "It was also a good base to go and explore areas like Kuta, Uluwatu, Jimbaran beach etc as they are all just 20 - 40 mins drive from there",
        "They have a different theme each evening but they didn't have a sauce with them so they were a bit dry",
        "Turtles have laid there eggs on the beach and the hotel protects them until they hatch",
        "This place was honestly amazing",
        "The rooms are older but they are spacious and all have balconies with a view",
        "We visited the spa for a massage session and facial, the staff are very good at what they do, they're always smiling and willing to offer their assistance when needed",
        "In the dark it was impossible to avoid stepping on them and having them pop like light bulbs",
        "On our third day, we need a room for family talk, and they gave the meeting room free of charge!",
        "They do have a free shuttle service on the hour to go to Bali Connection",
        "Nothing negative to say whatsoever",
        "The beach was cleaned everyday and the weather was perfect",
        "I do agree with the other reviewer, they need to fix the wifi problem",
        "Another thing, the hotel's breakfast buffets is sumptuous but I do hope they change their menu",
        "We were pleasantly surprised as the photos on the website didn't really do this place a justice, however I have been told by the management that they are in the process of upgrading the photographs",
        "Issue with this hotel was the noise in the rooms, especially from the rooms above and you can hear everything from people walking, moving chairs, opening wardrobes and dropping anything on the floor",
        "authentic place of Bali, in middle of touristic place - great entrance and nice stuff - but beach and pool should have mor local authentity -",
        "There are sellers of clothing and other items on the beach that you expect will be annoying but in fact they are all licensed and behave well",
        "They may approach you but a quick \"No thank you\" will be enough to send them on their way and they won't bother you again",
        "simply yummy!!",
        "It's good for the kids, also (I don't have, but it's a place they would love)",
        "They also provide a lot of amenities",
        "They're well trained to offer us the best experience",
        "And they reached it",
        "its a very nice property for the price they offer it in",
        "They have a brilliant Pool Bar",
        "however, All in all this is excellent resort, perfect for relaxing and rejuvenating the soul",
        "Besides, they have good services, spa, lounge, beach and many more",
        "Yes, they have a small pond beside the breakfast area",
        "It would be great if they have a bath tub",
        "Why are they at least helping the environment and picking up the trash????? Not a cool move Nusa Dua! I also noticed that the waiters by the pool/ beach/ bar did not recycle their bottles",
        "The spa is totally worth it, specially the sauna and jacuzzi deserves at least an hour everyday :) the keckak dance with lobster dinner is also a most!!",
        "Our room's air conditioning did not work and despite the fact that I ask two managers and and an engineer to fix it or move us they didn't",
        "As I am not a coffee drinker, I drink Diet Coke in the morning and after two days of having it at the breakfast area, on the third day a waiter told me that they didn't offer diet coke in that restaurant",
        "My 7 year old daughter said the kids club was terrible, they made cookies but weren't allowed to eat them",
        "Not a good start at all",
        "We had an amazing time, there was a great variety of local fruits at breakfast, the restaurants also offered good meals for dinner and lunch (although they can be a little expensive in comparison to other restaurants in Kuta or Ubud I think they were reasonable for a 5 star hotel)",
        "They are plastic and look dated especially in comparison to the ones in the other hotels alongside Nusa Dua's beach",
        "They sat me, a young family and others at their bar ( No utensils or place mat) and then turned it into the smoking den for a tour group of Russians When I moved the ash trays away from where I was eating they moved them back",
        "They did not care no matter what you said they answered YES YES The smoking also happened around they pool several days in a row",
        "i believe this resort is 30 years old but they have gone to great lengths to keep the resort from looking dated",
        "the staff is what makes this place great",
        "The place is baby friendly",
        "Same goes for the spa",
        "Sure there are cheaper places outside of the resort area for drinks and spa treatments but when on vacation at a resort like this, everything you need is right there",
        "If we needed something we would just call and they would have it at our room within a reasonable time",
        "But these are unfounded",
        "The patio chairs were unusable due to them being wet all of the time and smelling of foist",
        "I hope they can improve the variety of the food in the future",
        "But the most annoying thing about the place was that there was no WiFi in the hotel rooms which is incredible considering how many people use iPads or similar",
        "When I called asking them to reconfirm our flight they instead gave me the phone number",
        "We have stayed in many 5 star hotels in Bali including the Conrad & Nusa Dua hotel is up there with the best of them",
        "The amenities were replaced everyday & housekeeping were most friendly",
        "as this place is just one of its kind",
        "One of the families we met there in the pool travelled to value regularly (they were from Perth, so very easy access with quick short flits) and they had stayed in a number of hotels with their young children and felt this was the best due to the pools - they are by kid friendly with a little sandy beach sloping gently into the water",
        "There were around 4 restaruants and enjoyed the seafood and Kacek dance on our last night",
        "Chose this hotel based on the good reviews on TA and also because they had a suitable room configuration for us",
        "I just wanted to give a balanced review so that people do not think that all is peachy about this hotel",
        "The staff were friendly and eager to help, however they were let down by one major issue - communication",
        "All in all, the stay was bittersweet",
        "The bar was open until 2am and when we arrived at 1am we could unwind with a drink and were not made to feel like they wanted to close for the night",
        "The owners of the resort are some middle eastern investment arms of an oil rich state in the middle east, and they have recently injected funds to re-do the resort",
        "All in all",
        "not a single negative thing to say about the place",
        "Would definitely stay there again in the future",
        "We walked down to Bali Collections which is a great shopping centre with many restaurants - all much more reasonably priced than eating at the Hotel and they had great entertainment also",
        "Usually two or three of the five computers were not working and they were also very slow",
        "The staff there were very helpful too, as they helped me to confirm our dining reservations outside the hotel and with our driver to Ubud",
        "I believe they had about 60% occupancy",
        "The Palace Club (like a corporate club) was excellent with the highlight no doubt being the excellent staff, nothing was too much trouble for them and they always had a warm greeting and smile on arrival",
        "Overall, a perfect romantic place to visit with loved ones",
        "Rooms were very well maintained and the staff looking after them were terrific",
        "Oops i forgot - they have got a lovely spa",
        "food choices are a tad limited for indians and thats the one thing they can work to improve - though they are quick to get you stuff when asked , but nicer to see it on a menu upfront",
        "At least you got into the palace club, where they had an really good breakfast and cocktail hour (all free)",
        "Afternoon tea everyday is fantastic, and evening cocktales are great! The price of alcohol has gone up in Bali so free cocktales and canapes for 1 hour and a half hours is great value! This hotel is as good as it gets, nowhere else compares",
        "Staff throughout the hotel seemed to treat thier role as just a job, the only people who were outgoing and cheerful were the housekeeping team - now if only they could pass on their cheerfulness to others",
        "The bathrooms look like they might have had a refurb relatively recently but whoever designed them needs to go back to design school",
        "The place is fairly large and run in a very industrial fashion",
        "Very clean hotel, lovely beach area's, pool area's where large, good for kids beach pool, breakfast included was very good, room was very spacious, but the best thing was the staff, the service was great, and they couldn't do enough for you",
        "It was a bit of work for me to get in, but ALL my valuables were intact",
        "Gym was one of the hottest ones I have ever worked out in and they had run out of drinking water",
        "Maybe I'm not the target audience for this kind of place",
        "- freezing aircon in the room (you can't turn it off - in the fight against climate change, they're on the side of climate change);",
        "We were surprised upon our arrival at the hotel, the hotel is HUGE (we didn't expect it because we made the booking at very last minute, thus didn't do much research on this hotel) and they have good services, spa, lounge, beach and many more",
        "It would be great if they have a bath tub",
        "Our other meals tended to be at Bali Collection which had a lot of options, but unfortunatley each place we chose resulted in just mediocre average meals",
        "The night before they just had a large group staying in the hotel, so they were running out of clean room",
        "But even though they don't have much, they seem to really figure out how to have everything!",
        "We had the traditional duck one night and we also had the rice tasting menu all was very good",
        "The place where you eat breakfast was wonderful",
        "And of course, those chip'n dales are really adorable",
        "Do not get a cab from the hotel they add 60% to the fare",
        "Stayed at the Nusa Beach Hotel on the 22nd Sept to the 29th Sept,2012 Loved the place",
        "Staff always ready to help and always have a smile on their faces no matter how busy they were",
        "All for a reasonable price considering we were in a 5 star Hotel",
        "5 star hotels often charge a lot and they see their clients as $$$! Well, there is nothing wrong with offering excellent service and ask for the price but of course it is very important to offer such service with friendly staff and values",
        "At least in non 5 star hotels you don't pay much and don't expect much even but mostly they offer better services",
        "Plenty to do for all",
        "Once they found out we were on our honeymoon they gave us some complimentary drinks in our room",
        "15 min walk to shopping centre (bali collection which is more western in that the prices are fixed and there is no aggressive sales people) and art museum",
        "lovey balcony to seat on to take in the views of the sea and beach and of course the gardens",
        "All in all, amazing hotel",
        "This place has all the amenities needed for a fantastic holiday",
        "Forgot to take the do to disturb sign off the door and went out for the day, came back at 11pm to find a note telling us to contact us on our return and they'd come and do the room",
        "which they did",
        "Its a heaven for golfers,10 mins walk takes you to nearest golf course",
        "Also I think it's a pitty that although housekeeping did a great job in cleaning the main parts of the rooms, they forgot to clean small corners",
        "At breakfast they remembered our names and preferred coffee",
        "I liked the way they changed items every day",
        "They had a western corner offering about 6 dishes, Asian corner also 6 dishes",
        "All the staff without exception were very friendly, always greeted you and asked if everything was OK, they were never pushy",
        "They could upgrade the level of service as the upgraded their face already",
        "Can't seem to stop people holding the sun lounges but as we were out there early and stayed there, it didn't seem to bother us but gave us something to watch when people either came back or trying to find one",
        "kind staff, they brought me fruits and they prayed for my recovery",
        "Be it while checking or Breakfast, Pool side Restaurants or even during their Dinner With Traditional Bali Dance",
        "Nice kingsize bed and many closets to our clothes",
        "All around in the gardens there were tame squirrels, they took food from your hand! Nice, clean beach",
        "Lucky I have some peanuts so I get to hand-fed them everyday, they are very friendly!",
        "And when we wanted to use the internet on the business centre they were going to charge us A$3",
        "They try to make money wherever they can",
        "This place is perfect for gateway or for the honeymoners",
        "Only used the kids club once which the kids seemed to enjoy but they preferred to be in the pool! Drinks and food in the hotel are extremely over priced as are the spa services - Bali collection which is only a 2 min taxi ride ($1) or 10 min walk away is the place to eat and cheap massages and beauty treatments available in spas at the main gates of Nusa dua also walking distance ($8-$10) for one hour massage",
        "They even provided some small gifts to make our girl's birthday a very special one",
        "The food was absolutely delicious and the birthday cake which they arranged was great too",
        "There is free Wi-Fi in the Lobby but the speed is not amazing as I guess there are many people using it",
        "Get there early",
        "The evening entertainment is limited, but most people probably are not looking for that anyway",
        "com they charge much cheaper than the hotel rates",
        "5 yr old kid - All of us were very happy with quality of service and surrounds",
        "Breakfast was not bad with great varieties and they did change part of the menus daily too",
        "Will definitely recommend this hotel to others, if they prefer to stay at Nusa Dua area!",
        "After receiving no help whatsoever from the management, I have contacted the Summit Group which is the parent company and I wait patiently for them to get back in contact with me",
        "When we were there the hotel was about 50% occupancy, which resulted in there not being other kids there, as a result of this our kids didn't use the kids club until late in our stay when another child was there for them to play with",
        "people are very cordial and helpful",
        "The Westin and Laguna seem a lot more luxurious; however with the exception of the open lobby areas and some cosmetic touches here and there, they feel like more typical luxury hotels",
        "My advise would be to talk 200 metres to the end of the road and use of taxis waiting there",
        "They are marvellous",
        "but this place is extraordinary",
        "The others have tired room, and some have newly design room, but they don't replace the bed yet",
        "I come and stay in this hotel for many times before and they don't have my record in the computer",
        "I would not pay what they ask now",
        "Hopefully at future they could fix this problem and we could enjoy also at Hotel bars, sounds funny problem, but all people doesnt like mixed cocktails and martini jokes",
        "They arranged for musicians as well on our request!! The overall experience was amazing and incomparable",
        "All in all",
        "People are manipulative and decisive",
        "The dance, temple, everything was just stupid",
        "They start with 250 $ and can end up selling it for 20 $ after wasting your time and just constantly lying to you",
        "So already expensive - but then they add 21% government tax and 10% service charge to the price! I complained several times and they agreed it was expensive and many guests had complained about it, but there was nothing they could do (was advised to have complained earlier on check out - bartering gets you everywhere here!)",
        "The next day, they asked me again about the A/C",
        "But they want to make sure their guests feel comfortable, so they offered me a room upgrade to the premium room",
        "They took care their guests very well",
        "The breakfast was just OK, but I love the surrounding of the restaurant, they have a beautiful and big fish pond",
        "Staff were amazing and I am already planning my return trip :) if you want luxury and relaxation then this place is perfect",
        "Its Balinese restaurant is amazing and i strongly suggest you indulge in one of the multiple course menus that they have here! when we went it was not very crowded and people seemed to dine outside the resort - i honestly didnt feel the need to do that, yes its not cheap but the food quality is very impressive",
        "This place is decorated in traditional Balinese style and you really feel you are away from it all",
        "They should have some live entertainment at night, a band or lounge singer",
        "Had a couple of beers at the bar by the beach (where they do a happy hour pizza for next to nix) and then a magnificent dinner right on the beach with a brilliant young guitarist setting the atmosphere",
        "The grounds are full of superbly manicured detail whether it is foliage or terraces between floors and the whole place is truly spotless",
        "In short they are running this hotel on the cheap and overcharging for every single bit of extra service not included in the standard package",
        "they basically rip you off",
        "Many waiters choose not to wear shoes - fair enough - but please could they treat their feet! Part of the lack of energy coming from the staff could also be that they seem to be older than the staff in other hotels around Nusa Dua (eg St Regis, Club Med) and less educated given their level of English",
        "If you are on decaf, be prepared to have to repeat you order at least 3 times to different waiters before they bring it to you! The gala dinner was a let-down for that reason",
        "I knew that the rooms at NDBH had been remodelled, so was looking forward to seeing how they looked",
        "I really believe that it is the staff at Palace Club that make your stay an enjoyable one, and thank goodness they have remained the same",
        "My only other gripe with the hotel itself is that they seriously need to consider replacing the old brown towels at the spa pool, and perhaps new ones by the main pools also, as they are starting to look quite tatty",
        "Jan 2012, we only stayed 2 nights here and then stayed at a couple of other resorts, from the moment we arrived right through until we left this place was gorgeous",
        "I have to commend the hotel for it's English speaking staff, very fluent and this made the stay so much more pleasant when you could communicate with staff, and they were interested in helping out with questions about Bali and where to go etc",
        "They were all so helpful always, and would always acknowledge their guests all the time with a smile and a hello, throughout the resort",
        "They were expensive but only medium quality for Bali standards",
        "The workout facility is adequate and they even have squash courts and tennis courts",
        "My kids love the beach so much, they practically spending most of the time getting wet in the beach and pool",
        "They only got indoor for food and sleep",
        "Sometimes, they did get tired and wanted a break",
        "Great place stayed there and used it as a base",
        "They have a lot of people from all walks of life and all nationalities to deal with",
        "We met guests there who had stayed on 7 or 8 occasions, they love it",
        "They all looked great, and had good basic English",
        "Now, there are a couple of things that should be addressed but they did not take our enjoyment of the place away",
        "Hotel and grounds are spotless, room was huge and clean, people are friendly, especially Mushadi, the swim-up-bar cocktail pro",
        "Free upgrade to a Palace Club Suite was awesome, but the Palace Club Lounge a tad dissapointing, ordering free cockatils during the 2-hour window is excruciatingly slow, almost as if on purpose, then they \"run out\" of Jack Daniels!? Shelves stocked up again when free time is up though! Breakfast food hygiene, hmmm, some things need to be kept on ice, or not re-used the next day",
        "Nusa Dua is an extremely quiet spot, which has it's good and bad points, but overall Nusa Dua lacks the exciting chaos that most people love Bali for",
        "We stayed in primier room from 9 Dec to 12 Dec, All their room have garden view, they have beach but no wave",
        "They give free of charge extra bed for child under 12 yrs",
        "The all of the beach are secure with security gates & surround just by 5 start resort & hotel",
        "At night they had live piano & singer by the lobby lounge area and was quite superb!",
        "While the restaurants in the hotel are a little expensive, they are very nice",
        "Very quiet place to relax and just lay by the pool",
        "The staff at this hotel are unbelievably helpful, every time we needed something they did everything they could to assist",
        "One day they made kites and then went out on to the beach to fly them, another day they dressed her up like a Balinese Princess and made temple offerings",
        "Our room was fine but there could have been some improvements- ie the bathroom was tiny with no shower screen so the whole place would get wet! We also were given a family room, which was great for the extra space but kind of felt like it was a bit of poor planning, a bit pointless having an extra single bed in an adjoining room",
        "They were looking for $90 for the day",
        "a bit rich when we all know that they are probably paying about $50 per month for broadband",
        "Yes, there was a bit of work going on in the hotel but this didn't inconvenience us in the slightest (they were renovating the roof above one half of the lobby bar and a few of the rooms)",
        "Anyone who went to breakfast and couldn't find something to eat must have something wrong with them",
        "We also visited the local village with it's shops and markets, even the local people were friendly",
        "This is the 1st Hotel in Nusa Dua, and they are giving it a facelift now to keep it upto date and fresh",
        "Very few kids (four on both occasions), the room was a bit dark and depressing (although very well stocked with toys etc), seemed to be no sign of the advertised activities going on, and on both occasions when I went to pick up the kids they were sitting watching TV",
        "Its a big place so even those with kids don't seem to get in the way of others",
        "They add certain characters to the hotel",
        "Yes there are so many of them than other hotels, and they are so much braver",
        "Sometimes it takes a bit getting the message across about what you want, but then they will deliver",
        "The architecture of this hotel and the gardens, the dress of the staff all scream BALI",
        "Check the guest photos, they don't lie",
        "They welcome you, everyone of the staff",
        "From the housekeeping staff to the Hotel wedding Planner, they were amazing",
        "This hotel is now completing big renovations which are hardly creating any inconvenience to guests as the hotel has 3 wings and they are spread far apart",
        "Loved the place, the pool and beach are side by side and are both amazing",
        "Instead all they offered was 2 towels twisted into the shape of swans and a letter welcoming us and inviting us to purchase a seriously overpriced meal overlooking the sea",
        "Tip: Ask for blue bird taxis when out and about as they are metered and very reasonable",
        "Brekfast is great and they manage crowds very well",
        "An information card on the air conditioning controls would be a bonus as they are a bit hard to work out",
        "Food is expensive and \"special event\" nights grossly overpriced, but on the whole, we were more than happy to eat lunch and have drinks/ccktails and felt that they were worth it",
        "Heaven on a stick (and you can get some really good clothes etc on the beach from some of the very few vendors allowed there!! - very well controlled)",
        "In the hotel is also every night life music and twice a week a beautiful dance is preformed with a great dinner buffet",
        "first of all the room wasnt nice and there were lots of bugs but they moved us",
        "The room was magnificent and we were told that they are going to renovate them soon to make them more modern",
        "They were very popular with the guests",
        "Friends also used the gym which they said was good",
        "Hopefully the renovated rooms improve on a couple of the downfalls and they increase in-room entertainment options",
        "com, the price difference is $100US per night yet when I enquired and offered to pay for an upgrade they wanted an extra $285US per night",
        "They were certainly focusing on quantity and not quality",
        "Start from the very first arrival until the end of our stay, they treat us fairly or even better!",
        "They give you enough! The bed was also big enough to fit me and our baby, so we don't have to push one another around just to get enough space room",
        "The breakfast was VERY GOOD, they have so much menu choice from local to japanese",
        "But the sea is only good to swim at the morning til noon, since at the afternoon they go low on tide (maybe its seasonal effect)",
        "They're just amazed us",
        "One more thing, the food/drink price is quite expensive for my side, so either you manage to brought it from the outside, or bring extra cash (maybe this is how they maintain the taste afterall)",
        "This, in front of a queue of people! Needless to say, no email has arrived as we owed them noithing",
        "This hotel is most definitely in the third rate, package tour category, and if this is the standard of room they put people in on short stays then they don't deserve passing business",
        "My children went to kids club which they thought was boring due to stuff being a little lazy to do anything exciting with kids",
        "Mostly they were watching TV, so my kids didnt want to go to club as they wanted to be more outdoors",
        "Our kids were well look after by all the staff and enjoyed the kids club, kids pools (3 of them) and the main pool where they loved sitting at the pool bar and having mocktails",
        "The staff are all so friendly and helpful, they delighted in providing the boys with food to feed the fish every morning",
        "The Hotels accommodation is currently being renovated with no disruption to the hotel's operation and facilities as they are completing a wing of accommodation at a time",
        "The facilities also include a beautiful lap pool and spa cafe, and only persons above the age of 12 years allowed",
        "The caring staff treat all guests as though they are old friends",
        "Bfast spread is awesome there are some nice eateries just outsode also and they pick you up and drop you also at the hotel",
        "If you get out into the beach and walk to the left you will also find a lot of shacks as well as people who provide you water sports they are safe too",

        "we booked our trip with AsiaLuxe Holidays and what a find they were, especially Darrell Clausen, a consummate pro",
        "they use bhi tours & travel in bali for transfers,tours,etc",
        "They do very fast service",
        "Would have been nice if the hotel had a \"happy hour\", but then it was only a 3 minute walk to the Laguna where they have a daily 6-8pm 50% off all drinks!",
        "they charged about 45 USD for putting plaster and ice on finger",
        "would recommend to all and love to go again !!! have a pleasant stay",

        "If you come here on a rainy season (December, January) be ready to experience lots of rain, but it will not bother you - especially in Nusa Dua Beach - since there's too much to admire, you breath is taken away by the beauty of the hotel and the island - and you simply do not notice there's extra water coming from above",

        "There are 3-4 restaurants inside the hotel but again good for non-vegetarian people only :),",
        "Basically we found the staff to either not understand the deal or make to difficult for us to use it",
        "We tried to use the squash court but then they tried to charge us $12 U",
        "but each restaurant calculated it to be worth different rupiah - at Chess Bar it was worth 10500 and the spa almost 12500? We tried to join in the 1hour kayaking activity and the man looking after it told us we needed to pay for the use of the kayaks",
        "A complimentary coffee or juice at 6",
        "Hoverer, all the pools are very well maintained",
        "But this is a mute point if all you can hear all day and even after 11 pm are angle grinders",
        "The staff in both the palace lobby and the club are great and made us feel like royalty",
        "I think we were quite lucky to get sea view room without even requesting it",
        "It gives you opportunity to have a walk down the beach, have a little peek or just have a drink in one of multiple beach bars",
        "I think there is another one just being built but don't really know when it opens",
        "Heaven on Earth!?",
        "Is it realy possible?",
        "We had our 8 year old son and there was heaps for all of us to do",
        "We had the Luxury Escapes Package and thought it was very good value",
        "The Spa was divine, pool was awesome and if I could say one negative it would have to be the slippery pool area, we saw a few people go down and it is quite dangerous, so be careful !! Other than that I would not hesitate to go back and recommend NDBH&S Thanks so much for the memories you have created !!!!",
        "Even though this hotel is one of the older ones in Nusa Dua it is very well maintained and charming",
        "Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our time and would recommend it",
        "They couldn't do enough for us",

        "Our \"Luxury Escapes\" package was everything we wanted it to be",
        "My room is very comfortable, a bathtub will make it much better",
        "And, The 1st room I got was far away from the sea and the garden, outside my window was a construction site, it was really noisy",
        "However I got a much quieter room with much better location after I called the frontdesk",
        "What bothers me is that why don't give the better room in the 1st time? It was a pretty unpleasant experience, but except this, the whole journy in Bali and Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is great!",
        "Loved every minute of it",
        "We have never before had such a wonderful experience in Bali - the hotel is very reasonably priced for all it has to offer- beautiful grounds, beautiful pools, extremely comfortable room, helpful and friendly staff and the most amazing buffet breakfasts",
        "We stayed here for one night only to finish up our Bali trip with a little bit of R&R",
        "We were not dissapointed",
        "We enjoyed the professionalism of the staff",
        "We were placed in a Palace Club Suite but on the second floor not the 4th floor as in the past",
        "It is a beautiful resort and staff are a credit but may be time to compare it to something else",
        "We come to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel Palace Club nearly every year",
        "It is a great resort, very clean, fantastic garden",
        "It was our 40th Wedding Anniversary and we had previously informed them of this and when we arrived in our room, we were greeted with a lovely basket of flowers with a congratulations note and a basket of fruit",
        "The air conditioning worked well as it hit you how nice and cool the room was",
        "We were also given a free alcoholic cocktail voucher to use at the lobby bar",
        "The restaurants add a service charge and tax to the bill, which does bump the price up, but we were given vouchers to deduct from the bill, so it equalled out",
        "00 to 7",
        "Also the Lobby Bar had a happy hour from 10",
        "00 until late, about 1",
        "We particularly liked the Spa Pool, as it was lovely and quiet, no-one under the age of 12, with a lovely pool, beds and umbrellas and changing rooms with Jacuzzi facilities, separate for male and female",
        "It was such a delight to walk up to reception and be offered friendly advice and assistance",
        "A week we needed a month here",
        "We had a family room partial ocean view and it was great! There was lots of space for our one year old to move around and the atmosphere was cosy and relaxing",
        "If there had been a standing shower area and a extendable shower head it would have been ideal when showering babies",
        "Decided to stay 4 nights after staying in Ubud for 3",
        "We will certainly come back again in the future",
        "We just got married at Nusa Dua Beach hotel at it was picture perfect! Mrs Eka our wedding coordinator did an awesome job on the day and all the work to get it there! The gardens and staff are excellent",

        "We did not use any other services",
        "Lobby area has awesome fishes my kid totally enjoyed it",
        "We found the standard of food on the buffet dinners underwhelming",
        "In particular the whole fish (which we commented on exactly the same, 6 months ago) and the hot seafood - all overcooked to the max",
        "Wouldn't stop us returning though! The Palace Club inclusions and standard is just fabulous",
        "Mr G and his team are exceptional",
        "Our breath was taken away as soon as we pulled up to the traditional Balinese entrance gates and it just got better & better",

        "Everything was included and there were only a few restrictions",
        "We loved it but wondered if it was slightly through rose tinted glasses because of tge occasion",
        "From the moment we stepped out of the hotel transfer it was like we'd arrived home",
        "There is simply not one aspect of the hotel, its staff, food, accommodation, spa, pool, restaurants, grounds, locality that we couldn't rate 10/10 with only one minor exception",
        "Somehow the staff found out it was my birthday and out of the blue I was presented a birthday cake, accompanied by a large group of employees to sing to me",
        "It was very touching",
        "We ate after this experience at the Laguna & Westin & were more than satisfied",

        "We did the pouring",
        "It was our 30th wedding anniversary and we were looking for something special",
        "We found it and totally enjoyed the holiday",
        "Trying to think of a down side all I could come up with was the flight but it was well worth it would not hesitate to go back",
        "The service and effort by the staff is amongs the very best i have ever encountered, and we have stayed in many 5* resorts in Bali, Thailand and Malaysia",
        "I believe we got great value using the voucher but I wouldn't pay the full amount to stay (think it was $270US per night normally)",
        "Pretty impressed with the restaurants too but we got free meals with our voucher - I wouldn't be too happy paying full price as it was much more expensive then Kuta restaurants",
        "We have already booked a second stay at the resort, and have recommended it to our friends and family",
        "Allan 10 May, 2015",
        "Private beach is great, lots of pools and Raja's does the best bebek betutu I've ever had",

        "We loved it all",
        "Although listed as a 4",
        "5 to 5 star resort, please be prepared definitely not to South African or Japanese standards",
        "Thankfully we had a free upgrade to the Premier room from a deluxe room but this only made a difference in terms of space",
        "So we could not make use of the sport recreation facilities as we felt rushed to return to our daughter",
        "I ended up giving detailed instructions on how we wanted our food prepared after too many fails, at best I can say it tasted little better than airline food",
        "But if you want a luxury stay, I would say give this place a miss",
        "brought and taken away as we required",
        "We can recommend everyone tot visit nusa dua beach hotel",

        "It has a bath and balcony",
        "if you think it's a good idea to put a book on a lounge then go for breakfast, go to the fitness centre etc",
        "Having said that workers in these resorts earn between US$100 and US$200 per month so a few extra bucks means more to them than it does to you;",
        "We had an issue where one staff member assured us there was an 8 seater van we could take to Seminyak for RP500,000 for 3 hours",
        "When we got to reception we not only discovered there is no such van but there had not been any transport arranged for us",
        "Reception and also the Transport Desk didn't seem to understand that it was an issue for us",

        "We chose a room overlooking the tropical garden and were really happy with it",

        "We would definitely stay here again",
        "We stayed at Nusa Dua for 3 nights, In October 2013 with our 2 children aged 6 and 2",
        "Food was average - I thought",
        "Bit on the expensive side (but it is common in Bali at the resorts)",
        "Most times we went on the free shuttle to the Bali Collection (an outlet for shopping/eating) where meals there were a lot nicer and not to mention cheaper",
        "We stayed on the top level (can't remember room number) viewing pool area",
        "I recommend this place to families",

        "Without exception every member of staff greeted us with a big smile and nothing was too much trouble, we really did feel like their valued guests",
        "My only complaint was very slow WiFi and not free in the rooms, I know we all spend too much time on our iPhones but it was useful for planning trips etc and keeping in touch with home",
        "This was our first time to visit Bai and although we had some concerns about the weather, and the deal itself, we were amazing",
        "Not one day did we have any complaint about the room spacious and comfortale",
        "It is isolated from other areas but for a reasonable price there are many guides available, we organised one from trip advisor recommendations and did a day",
        "Tour because we just wanted to relax",
        "Because I had never been to anywhere tropical like this I had to get used of the temperature and sometimes very hot we always went to the pool",
        "You get to understand many of the ways of keeping cool in a rtrpical weather zone and this is what had stopped me from spreading my Asian wings I will be forever grateful to all staff and my husband in making our holiday once in a litime dream come true",

        "I'm so happy that we chose this Resort as part of our Honey Moon",
        "It was a nice place to be, with several different things to do but at the same time it gives you the chance to chill out and relax",
        "We had the most amazing time at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa",
        "I would recommend this resort to all of my friends and family",
        "We will definitely be going back",
        "Apart from a few language breakdown moments and one evening when the service seemed to be run by trainees, everything was most enjoyable and I would stay again",
        "it was our 5 stay and will not be the last the hotel and grounds where perfect but the staff where even better its like our second home",

        "This was the second time I stayed at Nusa Dua Hotel and Spa",
        "This was our 4th stay and no doubt we'll be back",
        "I wont give 5 stars as i did feel at one point a little discriminated against because I had tan skin (filipino/mexican) and i think they thought i was a local instead of a tourist (i came from california!) and did not give me service at the beach like they gave all the other \"light skin\" guests",
        "Lovely gardens,ducks,squirrels and aquatic life made it a joy for our grandson as well",
        "We will be back!",
        "It's a nice resort but a little tired and old",
        "We were not disappointed the good at Raja Balinese was amazing and I loved their lemongrass, honey ginger and coconut ice cream flavors",
        "As it was my third 'stay'(unfortunately without my late husband this time) I found the management and staff as wonderful and accomodating as ever",
        "otherwise my stay was very pleasant and with late checkout,compliments of Bruce White,was very impressed and we were appreciative of the kind gesture",
        "This was the 3rd leg of our Asian 5 star tour, and although really nice building, grounds and beach it just lacked a little on a couple of things like service and the room felt very damp (our helpful cleaner Warna said that he could bring a dehumidifier if we wanted, so may have had similar issues?) we decided to turn off the air con at night and seemed to be better",
        "Apart from Dewi at the Loung Bar (who was really nice with great interaction skills), Rina (customer relations) and Warna (housekeeping) I can't think of any one else to mention as being stand outs",
        "Look, it's a nice hotel, 5 star - just because of its facilities and location on a great beach",
        "I read that most people raved about the breakfast- well it was just ok nothing great to be honest, apart from the fruit selection",
        "One of the best weddings and times I have experienced",
        "The two pools were great, although we struggled with the temperature, it was quite warm; but this was the same issue with our previous accommodation in Legian, so we assumed it was due to the warm/humid weather!",
        "From the spa/sports centre you can also hire bikes, which we did one morning",
        "We rode around the streets and then along the beach",

        "Had booked a Luxury Escape package and was a bit dubious as to what we were letting ourselves in for",
        "We paid a bit extra to upgrade our room and it was totally worth it",
        "My 6 year old daughter had her own bed and we had a lovely room looking out onto the pool",
        "The ladies that ran it were lovely and the fact that she could come and go as she pleased while we were sat at the pool worked well for all of us",

        "Because I went for a meeting and I did not have to use much of the service in Hotel",
        "Please make bathroom better, it seems torn down",
        "Other than that it is quiet and serene",
        "Nusa Dua itself is quite an expensive area, so we found out",
        "Food was good and we tried several different restaurants",
        "It would be great if the wifi was available in the rooms for the price that you pay it seems crazy to ask guest to pay another 100,000 rps per day for in room wifi",
        "In this day and age it is time that it is just rolled into the room price",
        "We travelled here from Canada and so for us it was very expensive",
        "The buffet breakfast was fine but paying on average 40-50 U",
        "dollars for dinner every evening was a little exorbitant, if you like to have a drink or two on your vacation i would not recommend coming here",
        "We celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary staying in the Palace Club Suite",

        "It should've been cleaner like the other hotels",
        "I've got the price where it is only $6 different than the Westin",
        "It all depends on your own preferences",
        "For now, I'll either stay at Nusa Dua Beach hotel or Westin",
        "It was a really High price for The slow service, average food and bad tasting drinks, and we vad not very manu choices when it came to food either",
        "Hotel itself was very clean & well maintained",
        "I feel there could have been a greater variation in food choice as we ate at the hotel all the time",
        "We could not fault every aspect of the holiday",
        "it surpassed my expectations",
        "We arrived there very much in need of nurturing and a stress free holiday and this was achieved",

        "i hope to be able to promote this as I think it would be very special",
        "This holiday was also to celebrate our 10 th wedding anniversary but we won't be waiting 10 years to return!",

        "Our driver to Nusa Dua was very friendly and talkative, and it was a great start to the trip",

        "It took over 24 hours for the request to be understood and put into place",
        "Rooms are well used and worn but aceptable,on the otherhand the bathroom and shower clenliness was not acceptilble, we had lots of mould on the shower walls and floor annd asked the house keeping dept to come and clean on several occations untill we felt they were acceptable but not excelent",

        "While the hotel is starting to show it's age in some respects it was still a fantastic experience and we would highly recommend this resort",
        "This is the first time I have ever stayed in a hotel where you didn't have music booming out, or excessive noise of any kind from the beach, to the pool and the public bars and restaurants, it was shear heaven",

Staff were fab, my son tore his toenail off and the dr was called after hours to the I site clinic he was there within 20 minutes and a total of $67 for an injection and dressings!

        "After many different maintenace men coming into the room and not understanding finally at midnight a Manager came and realised it was broken and had it replaced but it had completely ruined my night as I could not relax and I was very upset as this was not the first time I spent hours sorting out maintenance issues",

        "Service was good, although I was a bit annoyed that they wanted us to pay for a late checkout; after a one-week stay and a generous tab that we'd run up I think they could have spotted us the room as a general 'thanks'",

        "we arrived to a gorgeous lobby n excited bout our stay",
        "that's until we arrived in our room, the deluxe room was small, not clean, cramped, when u sat on the toilet, one elbow hit the shower screen, the other the bench, it was tiny! the outdoor balcony chair cushions were saturated from the previous days rain",
        "the bath was very high and it was difficult for my mum to get into the shower, the place was tidy but not properly clean, we had no free wifi in our rooms which was a requirement for us when booking, infact it was an extra AUD11 per day which I was angry about as we booked requesting free wifi in our room, it was only free in the lobby and around the pool",
        "when I asked at reception, the man was very rude and told me that nothing could be done bout my mothers problem in the shower and the wifi issue was my misunderstanding as its just not included then he walked off on me as I was communicating with him at the reception desk",

        "We ended up doing it all ourselves via viator",
        "And don't get me started on having to pay for wi-fi in your room: outrageous! Also, don't bother trying to send postcards via the little store in the hotel - it took six weeks before the even bothered sending them out!",
        "I had heard a lot about this hotel, but ended up incredibly disappointed",

        "Still it took 30 minutes of our time to sort out and should not have been necessary",
        "The checkout person had the temerity to suggest our understanding was the result of verbal discussions until we produced the documents",
        "we travelled with 4 couples (8 pax in total) and we were well looked after",
        "We cant wait for our return trip",
        "The best hotel experience I have ever had",
        "Now I find out The rules have changed and I am no longer allowed into palace club because I have children",
        "the high light of our trip was the pool bar attendant MUSHARDI ,,, he has been there since opening day and he has perfected the pool bar atmosphere in the 30 odd years ,,, drinks and food expensive on local standards , but on par with Aus prices , but you expect that at 5 star resorts on the beach ,,, would I go back YES , would I do buffet dinners NO , it was our 10 wedding anniversary and we had paid for a pool view room , the AC Unit was broken and they upgraded us to a Club room , but no pool view that was a disappointment as we were separated from the rest of our party , the hotel did not charge us for the upgrade to pool view as compensation , but I would have preferred the pool view as it was just a nicer setting",
        "We (4 couples) recently stayed for 8 nights on a Luxury Escape deal",
        "We upgraded on the deal to a Premier room as we did not want to be in a room too far away from the pool",
        "Later we contacted the hotel and we all upgraded to a Premier room with a pool view at $25USD per night",
        "We were lucky enough to get the ground floor and were just a few steps from the pool area",
        "Loved the room, however, I think for the price, housekeeping could have been better, for example, the toilet door was timber slates and it was full of dust",
        "and the walls in the toilet I thought could do with a scrub",
        "On the whole thought it was a great room",
        "The resort, yes the resort was built in 1983 and it is showing its age with the stone work and pool tiles etc - some pool tiles in the \"kids\" pool were coming off and in fact I picked one up off the floor of the pool",
        "There are very few kids here as it is not aimed at children",
        "They are building a new restaurant on the beach front over the next 6 months of the off season but it was little noise and did not worry us",
        "Pizza and chess bar had great food - our friends went to the chinese restaurant and said it was excellent",
        "I make special mention of the pool bar attendant, Mr",
        "Machardi has been working at the hotel for years and was great to have a conversation with",
        "6 x 1hr spa treatments, free cocktails etc etc etc and list went on",
        "Ok, so our airconditiong broke and it took a day for someone to come to look at it, we didn't sleep for a couple nights due to the heat",
        "To us it was NOT an upgrade as we did not have the pool view only garden and we were not interested in using club facilities as we wanted to be with our friends for breakfast and evening cocktails not stuck in a room without them",
        "They did not charge us for the pool view room which was fair however it took many phone calls to get to this point as they did not understand that, to us, it was not an upgrade and we were not paying for something we did not get",
        "The ground floor was more important to us as I have a knee issue",
        "The hotel sent 2 gifts and a flower arrangement and an apology note which was very nice once it was all sorted",
        "Would I go back - YES in a heart beat but I would only be happy with a premier pool view room as we love swimming and looking at water - I can look at gardens anytime",
        "Would I use Luxury Escapes - YES but I would also look at the hotel website as they had a similar offer and I always prefer to book direct with hotel, just my preference",
        "After 12 years of visiting bali had my first case of bali belly on the first morning after eating breakfast and remained I'll for the duration of the 3 days - so glad to move onto our regular resort",
        "i have stayed at this hotel 3 times in the last 15 years and it keeps getting better each time",
        "It is a gem of shaded lounges around a lap pool",
        "we feel we got to know many of them personally over the 9 days",
        "I have stayed in 6 other hotels in Nusa Dua and have stayed here in my last 2 trips",
        "I love the spaciousness, after all it is a pretty huge development",
        "This hotel has been around for quite some time but you can tell that it's been pretty well maintained",
        "I'll definitely return whenever I would want to stay in Nusa Dua",
        "I stayed at Nusa Dua resort for 8 days with my family (5 yr old girl)",
        "Being my first trip to Bali I can say I had great time and returned with good experience",
        "I will list out my plus and minus points as follows:",
        "We left totally relaxed, happy and happy to stay there again",
        "We got the Palace Club Room and had fantastic benefits - private check-in, our own place to have breakfast and more importantly, a spacious room! The grounds of the hotel was beautiful just to walk about and the private beach was definitely a plus point! Would definitely go back!",

        "We never left the resort",
        "Having to pay over $3",
        "I like the view when I entered the gate of this hotel especially in the evening, I can feel the ambiance of Bali with the little light of the lamp, it was great",
        "The facility and the service was great, I asked something for room service in the middle of the night and they were quick serve us",
        "But what I like it most is the price was not as expensive as others in that area which you can have a 5 stars hotel and direct access to the beach, because I love to see the sunrise in here",
        "We go to Bali regularly and know the area and thought we'd try a different resort to where we usually stay",
        "Although our package was good value and included meals at the resort and spa treatments, we were disappointed a little with the quality of the food",
        "As for everything else, we got good value out of our package, but the overall atmosphere was not as good as it could be, ie, a bit flat",
        "I think if they upgrade their pool-side and in-room food options, they would be better",
        "It has beautiful gardens and grounds, is on the seafront and has the most amazing view of the ocean",
        "I've traveled the world and stayed in all sorts of Hotels/Resorts and I can not fault this beautiful Hotel",
        "The staff are courteous & offer a gracious Balinese charm",

        "Highly recommended though in house costs are a little expensive if you are not in the Palace Club rooms - you simply must upgrade as it is great value!!",
        "Enjoyed the breakfasts (we didn't need lunch)",
        "For example, I was accidentally charged for a dinner when it was covered with a pre-paid voucher",
        "I will come again",
        "Even not having wifi in rooms was a blessing in disguise as I was able to switch off and enjoy the holiday but then connect at breakfat if I had to",
        "We stayed 8 nights and had the best holiday",
        "Was better than I could of ever imagined",
        "Would recommend purchasing the packages as it is good value for money",

        "She didn't seem to want to learn as it was same the next show",

        "People return to this hotel year after year and although this was our first visit, it will certainly not be our last",
        "It includes an upgrade to Premier room, three dinners for two at the Balinese banquets, free cocktails, three spa treatments per person at the beautiful spa and free breakfasts every morning",
        "The breakfasts offered so much choice with fresh juices, eggs and pancakes cooked to order and a huge buffet spread of fruits, pastries, cereals and other savouries that we never needed more than a smoothie or juice for lunch",
        "The only negative was that the weekend we arrived the hotel was almost booked out with a big Japanese convention so we weren't upgraded for the first two nights and the first room smelled of smoke",
        "We booked an fantastic private driver for day trips to Ubud, white water rafting and the Elephant Sanctuary",
        "Jonto speaks excellent English and has a very comfortable 7 seater",

        "There is only one really tiny negative thing I could think of ( just so it's doesn't read as too gushy!) and that is the Chess Restaurant could sometimes get really busy in the evenings and then the wait to get a menu, have order taken etc could be very long, but this only happened a couple of times so it wasn't that big an issue",
        "I booked Premier room and requested for high floor",
        "Was very disappointed the the room I was given was on the ground floor",
        "I hunted around and saw it next to a pillar with no one near it",

        "95 compared to 6",
        "We had an amazing vacation and have no complain at all! Also, its architecture makes it the most unique hotel, if you want to feel you are in Bali, go to NDBHS, it is beautiful!!!",

        "My husband and I just stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 8 nights and found it to be very good",
        "Overall I don't have a bad word to say about the resort, it is a perfect escape for couples or families",
        "We accidently booked during school holidays however this didn't prove to be a huge issue as there was enough space and room at the pool/beach so that we weren't fighting for a beach chair or tables at the restaurants",
        "I will go back",
        "I will be returning in the coming years",
        "We had a great stay at the Nusa Dua Beach & Spa hotel",

        "It really does feel like seeing old friends !!",
        "The food options were more than acceptable and the beach access is the best we have experienced in Bali",
        "Above all though, the buffet breakfast was like nothing we have ever seen or experienced",

        "We will be returning in the not to distant future",
        "As for the venue, it is out of date, shabby, and smells of sewerage",
        "Staff can barely speak English, which, I would expect I from a budget hotel, not a 5 star resort",
        "Again - a 3 star delivery at the most, with deluxe 5 star pricing",
        "One night, upon returning from the disgusting buffet (charged $50, food was terrible), my daughter was so exhausted, just wanted to go to sleep, I open the room and find",
        "Called reception to notify them that as I have no babies, I don't see why there's a cot in the middle of the room, and obviously there's been a mix up as someone else is probably waiting for it",
        "Also explained my 6yo is very tired and needs to sleep so could they please get it out ASAP so we can call it a night",
        "Took 5 phone calls and 30 minutes to get someone to take it out",
        "Ps, the pool was amazing",
        "Been there 5 times, very good service, good food, going back, everybody is so friendly, we stayed at club suit, fresh fruit delivered every day to your room",

        "I stayed in a palace club suite with my wife and my son and wife with two young children in the family wing",
        "We chose this hotel because of very good TripAdvisor family reviews",
        "The Limo transfer from airport was excellent but we had to wait until after 5pm for a room",
        "This was unacceptable as we were already sweating from the walk to the limousine and although the waiting area overlooked a very beautiful garden it was still three hours in heat and humidity not accustomed to and although the tea was very nice we just wanted a shower and to freshen up",
        "Cocktails are 5:50pm to 7:00pm but unfortunately there was no tables left, so we were pretty disappointed with our start",
        "We both enjoyed it",
        "My wife did 8am yoga three times and it was very, very good",
        "It is a great location",

        "But it's a great experience",

        "aircon pathetic and I gave up trying to get high speed internet after an hour with their contractor",
        "Last night getting a taxi was tough and the Samuri warrir at the front told us that it was always better to walk",
        "Management decreed that a taxi dropping off a passenger could not be used and we had to book at the 'taxi counter' (a seemingly empty area), so we walked as usual",
        "Departure was not the Limo we had expected but it arrived ten minutes later than ordered and we managed to board our plane on-time, yet with concern",

        "Our last trip was in July 2014 and we focussed on SANUR 3-4 star hotels",
        "In the past we have always stayed at Seminyak, SANUR, or Kuta but this time we thought we might splash out and stay in a 5*****",
        "I cannot believe the contrast between Nusa Dua and other locations in Bali",
        "06:00 down to the 50m lap pool at the Spa for 20 laps - for the whole 8 days I was the only silly bugger up at that hour and had the pool to myself",

        "The choice is excellent, couldn't fault it",
        "They also have espresso machines, so I could enjoy a decent coffee with my breakfast",

        "Palace Club suite was a good size for us as we were travelling with a one year old",

        "We really enjoyed the pools and spent quite a lot of time in them",
        "It was quite good",
        "We got bored with the food by day 2 of our 5 day stay",
        "My biggest complaint was that we were located on the opposite side of the resort from our daughter and her family",
        "It was a 10 minute walk to get to their room",
        "They live 1/2 way around the world from us, and we really wanted to be close (we requested this prior to our stay)",
        "We gave up!",
        "In its prime probably 20 years ago it would have been up with the best hotels in Bali",
        "We tended to catch a taxi to Seminyak to eat at some amazing restaurants there",
        "Idyllic spot and a 'warm feeling' to the whole place that we thoroughly enjoyed",

        "Thank you we will certainly return",
        "The ladies at the spa were wonderful and our spa experience was one of the best I have had",
        "We really enjoyed our 8-days in the palace club",
        "The room (1019) was brilliant with it's outlook over the duck pond and manicured gardens",
        "We can't wait to come back again",
        "We stayed here for a week in July looking for complete relaxation",
        "It was fine, but it would not rave about it",
        "But, on the Saturday, we had to wait in line for 30+ minutes just to get a table",
        "Inadequate loungers around the pools meant that we often had to find somewhere else to hang out",
        "Restaurant prices were very high ($75+ for two adults and two kids sharing burgers and water)",
        "So, we went to the shopping center two miles away for most meals",
        "The hotel was fine, not good, and I would definitely not spend my tourism dollars by going back",
        "They gave coupons on arrival that we inevitably forgot to bring when we did eat in",
        "All in all, it just left a bad taste in my mouth at a fairly high cost",
        "In line with our expectations, we've been there 23y ago on honeymoon and we still found a very reputable and excellent hotel; of course years passed by for everybody, but Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is still in a very good shape",
        "We go yearly to Nusa Dua",
        "We would go again for sure",
        "This was our first trip to Bali and we were recommended to stay at the nusa dua beach hotel by friends and we were not disappointed",
        "We stayed in a Palace club room overlooking the beautiful ponds and temple which also meant we were located centrally to everything",
        "I had 3!",
        "We will definitely return",
        "I recently stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa with my husband and children",
        "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will absolutely return for another holiday soon",
        "I had a company business trip in Bali last June and was thrilled by this hotel",
        "Me and my husband are staying in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our Honeymoon",
        "We arrived on 23rd and the receptionist told us that our room was cancelled (although we paid in advance and told them that we are there for our honeymoon) and said we had to pay it again in our own expense",
        "We insisted that we paid before and wouldn't be paying again",
        "Well, long story short, they gave us a room, but we were not treated as \"honeymooners\" just as regular customers",
        "Thank you for your service, we had a great time",
        "Loved our second stay, all staff and management very helpful and a special mention for ANITA in the dining room, we found her to be a hard working helpful young lady",
        "I did early booking so I missed the promised discounts by congress organiser",
        "There are many pura and idols on-site (can't be helped I guess since it's Bali after all)",
        "Good family location, but somewhat isolated for active travelllers",
        "The hotel located in such a beautiful surrounding, but unfortunately we were having few problems regarding the service",

        "I found these to be cheaper than the ones in more touristy areas of Ubud",
        "Food: We paid for the breakfast for our stay",
        "We did have dinner a few times in the various restaurants in the hotel, the food is quite good, but a little pricey, in that is costs the same for as it would in the UK",
        "The TV was flat screen however if it doesn't have any USB ports",
        "which would have been nice as we bought a USB key along to watch some films",
        "The room has a standard safe and mini-bar, iron and ironing-board & is air conditioned",
        "so go ahead and try it",
        "Basically the seller will offer a deal to take you to X, Y, Z",
        "best to not do this even if it sounds cheap",
        "For the amount we paid and the facilities on offer at the hotel, i would recommend this hotel",
        "I'm going to start with the greats about this trip as there are many",
        "Our supposed package and fast track deal got us no favours other than a man meeting us as we got off the plane and showing us to the line",
        "I was not impressed with two young children andt the whole process taking around 90min",

        "We look forward returning next year",
        "We enjoyed our stay at Nusa Dua Beac Hotel",
        "It has great Balinese feel",
        "Impressive entrance to the hotel, airy and exotic lobby, really felt as if we had moved to paradise ! Stayed for 5 nights, felt as if we had stayed for 2 weeks! We stayed in the Palace Club side of the hotel, allowing us to savor the hotel's grounds in relative peace",
        "I recommend the spa for the ecstatic feeling of liquid butter after any of their spa programs :)",
        "- The restaurants are top-notch, we ate almost every night at Raja's, with enough variation on the menu to have a different meal each night",
        "Just spent 10 nights @ NDBH and thoroughly enjoyed it",
        "A tad pricey but with beach @ doorstep it was worth it",
        "The perfect holiday on a paradise island with fantastic people and optimum service, highly recommended to everyone!! We travel to Bali every year and always stay at this hotel because it offers genuine Bali traditions and is not just another luxury hotel which you can find all around the world",
        "It is always a relaxing stay and it always feels sad to leave!",
        "One thing we booked at the same time and I thought our rooms would be close but we could not have been further apart",
        "We had a wonderful eight night holiday in this lovely resort",
        "We very much enjoyed the spa, theme dinners and performances",

        "We had issues in communicating with the hotel staff before our check-in",
        "At the end of our 4 week holiday in Bali, we stayed in the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 4 nights",

        "I understand that it's a difficult thing, but I have thought about a couple of solutions to fix it",
        "Great for kids with mini-pool and kids club and activities",
        "The hotel was fie and we had a nice time",
        "It caters for the low end however eg",
        "We spent two weeks here last January",
        "We travel extensively on business so were desperate to relax and that's exactly what we did here",
        "Well at least until I did the whitewater rafting! We had a great room and views and a comfy bed - very good housekeeping",

        "We could not have stayed in a better hotel",
        "We felt very safe to have our 3 year old granddaughter Lilly with us",
        "We've just spent 7 glorious days at this resort in fabulous Bali weather",
        "This time we Stayed 8 nights in July on a luxury escape package- premier room with vip airport service",
        "We misinterpreted what this meant as we thought it was a fast track/express through customs bypassing the long ques, however, it was meerly a staff member purchasing our VOA which we were capabale of doing ourselves",
        "We still had to line up and gained no time as we had so hoped for travelling with small kids! Check in was very fast and smooth, however upon entering our room (family room/suite) we discovered no power, no cot as requested for our 2yr, and we (husband and wife) has 2 single beds! This was far from ideal given the late time of night after traveling all day with 2 tired children, however it was resolved fairly quickly, and our bed fixed the following morning",
        "Our room (2219 i think??!!) was fabulous, a separate nook for the kids (a curtain dividing their section off from ours would have been wonderful!), a massive balcony, and because we were above 2 restaurants, we could link up to the hotels free wifi in our room, BONUS!! Only complaint about room was the bathroom, it was so, so small",
        "Our son had to visit the doctor at the clinic whilst there, and he received a lovely bouquet of flowers and a follow up phone call- it was a really nice touch",
        "The kids club seemed great, however, there was hardly ever any kids in there which made our son a little apprehensive about going in there- so we never pushed it!",
        "The cost of food and drink was the highest I have ever seen in Asia",
        "We loved it so much husband and I decided to get married at nusa dua beach hotel and spa",
        "We'd never stay anywhere else",
        "every day we have deficiency and excess of amenity goods",
        "the house keeper dosen't relate a message od guest's require to the next day's keeper, i think",
        "It has two outdoor swimming pools and plenty of exclusive areas for group entertainment",
        "It is an old resort but has been maintained very well",
        "After my seventh stay in a Club Palace room I still love this hotel",
        "using many of the facilities available at the hotel we have no complaints,it was a most relaxing holiday for my wife and I and we will come again",
        "We had a great time at the hotel",
        "Again, prices are higher than in Kuta where a Circle K is on every corner! If you are in Kuta, go to Circle K and stock up and save some money",
        "The entry fee is the same as western prices, but it is a lot of fun",
        "Overall we all had a great timeand I particularly enjoyed feeding the fish and turtles in the resort foyer pond",
        "the hotel looks good from outside it has all the art of Balinese taste",
        "It's a beautiful resort with good atmosphere and services",
        "We first stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel in February 2014 and enjoyed it so much that we went back in July",
        "Second time round the hotel didn't seem as 'heavenly' but that could have been because it wasn't a novelty any more",
        "It had a bath tub but the shower was in the tub when we were expecting a separate shower; the latter I may say is usually the norm for 5 star hotels, at least in Asia it is",
        "The room was on the 4th floor and was so far away from reception that it was a real bind having to take so long to get there",
        "Would I return to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel? Not unless it is a last resort as there are so many other neighbouring 5 star resorts which are definitely worth trying",
        "We had a great time at the hotel",
        "It was verry nice",
        "and a very nice admosfear we feld verry welcome",
        "the food was very good and i enjoy it to go on the beach in demornig 6",
        "30 am and drink my mango juce and watsch the sun coming up",
        "For a hotel that was the first of its kind in Nusa Dua it is a beautiful resort with wonderful staff & attention to detail",
        "We travelled to Bali in June and stated at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for 9 nights",
        "We had a Palace club suite",
        "This worked well as at night time we could close the door and still watch TV , have a shower etc in our bedroom area",
        "We didn't use the palace club facilities",
        "it is a very quiet and serene area and we didn't think it was fair to the other guests to have our two little boys running around!",
        "We went to the playground at the resort every day",
        "We also walked up to Bali Collection most days for dinner or lunch - then caught the courtesy shuttle back",

        "We used the hotel taxi to go into Kuta/ Seminyak",
        "We took the three hour option",
        "They drove us there ( soooo quick with the new toll bridge ) and just waited till we wanted to go somewhere else or go back to the hotel",
        "It makes it difficult for those of us with small children trying to find a shady place to sit",
        "This is an issue management will have to do something about as we witnessed ALOT of frustrated guests trying to find a spot to sit",
        "This was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in",
        "I would recommend this place to anyone",
        "So in writing this we had a full week here and still one week to go",
        "We were quite unlucky with drapes falling down and tiles falling down in the doorway if the toilet",
        "I was quite offended in the pizza restaurant when we asked them specifically to not put mushrooms on they (our son is allergic) they just took some if them off, more cheese on and served them again resulting in that we found the hidden ones ourselves",
        "But I was naturally very offended by this",
        "We actually like this place, but I am conflicted taking into consideration the bad side",
        "We were there to attend a wedding and spent 3 nights at this hotel",
        "We were just too tired to request a different room after 24 hours of travelling",
        "Luckily I had a can of mosquito repellent and was able to kill the bugs",
        "We stayed at The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for 8 nights in March",
        "We chose it over some of the newer, more contemporary hotels as we wanted to stay somewhere traditionally Balinese in style, and whilst it has been going for over 30 years, it has been refurbished and is generally well maintained",
        "Being on the ground floor we had doors opening out onto a terrace where we could sit with a drink and watch the squirrels at play",
        "The hotel also offers guests free daytime activities - we actually really enjoyed carving flowers and leaves out of vegetables, and the trial scuba dive in the pool an interesting experience",
        "We had a great stay here",
        "We have never been to a better appointed hotel",
        "We are two well travelled 80 year olds but could not find a fault with the hotel's presentation, its gardens and delightful personnel",

        "We travel to Bali every year and always stay in Seminyak",
        "This year we purchased a special and went to Nusa Dua",
        "We were a little doubtful having never done this before but oh my god how wrong could we have been",
        "We had a fabulous holiday at this resort",
        "Food in all the restaurants was great and in fact we had the best steak ever here and thats saying something being an aussie",
        "I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone",
        "We are going back next year",
        "One of the most beautiful and comfortable hotels I've been",
        "It was quiet and relaxing, nice Beach, friendly and helpful people, good management",

        "After having spent 5 previous visits to Bali in Kuta (Tuban) we really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere that we found here",
        "I enjoyed the more \"international\" clientelle, a welcome change from the Aussies we normally encounter in Kuta",
        "They did offer us a rental one for $15/day which we felt was overpriced",
        "Ended up hiring one from Kuta for $4/day",
        "I'm really surprised at the glowing positive reviews for this place as we felt it was just OK",
        "We got 2 adjoining ground floor rooms for a great price",
        "Eg the Italian restaurant would not do spaghetti bolognese! The best food we had was room service",
        "It's an easy stroll to the Bali Collection but the hotel restaurants are well priced ( for food) and great quality",
        "The room overlooked beautiful gardens and overall I would say I was very happy with my week at this hotel",
        "We gave only been home for a few hours and we already have family planning to book this hotel for a holiday next year",
        "We will also be staying there again next time we visit beautiful Bali!",

        "We didn't do much exploring but will do next time",
        "We have one more day to make the most of",
        "We enjoyed this hotel very much",
        "Our room was clean and nicely appointed, only negative for me was the in-room mini bar fridge was very small and we were travelling with an infant so ok room for bottles but would have been handy to have some additional space for the actual mini bar items themselves (we had to empty it to allow for the milk and baby bottles)",
        "So much so that we determined to eat dinner anywhere else but here",
        "I broke my ankle in Ubud and the hotel went the extra mile to ensure I was comfortable and cared for",
        "This was our first time to Bali and it was fantastic!! We absolutely love Nusa Dua and the resort was excellent! Nothing can be faulted what so ever!! Easy access to everything that Bali has to offer!",
        "We could have done without the hassle, however it was rectified pretty quickly",
        "Definetly be back to stay",
        "GRound are great very clean, service in the palace club in the evening was very poor , we waited 40 mins for our drinks order , staff were selective in who they served other visitor got preference at evening time , we felt neglected on all 3 evenings , not like the service when we visited the last time",
        "We recently spent 5 nights at the Resort",
        "We loved the location and friendly staff",
        "Nothing was a trouble and we were always greeted with a smile",
        "myself and my two daughters 11yrs and 14yrs thought we were in PARADISE",
        "We opted for the premium deal but not the Palace Club upgrade and were not disappointed at all",
        "We stayed in a ground floor room in the Agung wing, near the pool (room 1138) and the room was lovely, with easy access to everything",
        "Our first neighbours liked to watch TV until late and again from about 5 am, which was annoying as it was clearly audible in our room, however, this is no fault of the resort and they checked out after two days before I bothered to comment, so meh",
        "The ground staff are exceptional and must work like fairies in the night as they are seldom seen and in no way intrusive, yet manage to ensure not a blade of grass is out of place, a tremendous credit to this 30+ year old resort",
        "As for the package, it is impressively facilitated especially given 600 to 800 guests being there on the same deal !! The spa is wonderful, the setting is beautiful and the small lap pool is perfect and never busy",
        "A brilliant effort by all involved",
        "We too had three buffet dinners and couldn't fault the facilitation of these, other than drink service being a little slow, but hey, it's a huge undertaking to provide good quality food for so many people over about 3 hours",
        "The food at Chef Restaurant by the pool was a little disappointing and I'd give this a miss",
        "Could I justify staying here at list prices given the additional expenses of wining and dining ?",
        "Also, room is very dimly lit which makes it difficult to iron clothes",
        "We stuck with the food not spoiled by the chef",
        "I have been a regular visitor to this great hotel but will have to review my options for the future",
        "We took the upgrade to the Palace Club and are so glad we did",
        "We enjoyed the friendly, smiley service - the Restaurant by the beach was a bit slow but it didn't seem to matter in such stunning surroundings",
        "I would struggle to recommend this hotel",
        "It can get very busy by the two big pools at the front of the resort",
        "This was our second stay at the hotel having spent 9 days there a year ago and it remains a very special place",
        "This time we spent 10 days at the hotel and again stayed in a Club room with access to the Palace Club lounge",
        "Our second stay here certainly didn't disappoint and we plan to return again",
        "If you like to have breakfast served to you in a lounge setting looking out over a wide expanse of gardens, drop in for afternoon tea or evening cocktails go for a Palace Club room it's worth the extra",

        "I was immediately impressed on arrival by the warmth and reception I received on arrival",
        "Great big bath as well",

        "Situated in a superb lush garden, I personally found the temperature cooler that in the hustle & bustle of Kuta",
        "It was HUGE !!! The main bed was a Super King size on steroids & the bathroom was very spacious",
        "I cannot speak more highly of this hotel & I must commend Urs (The GM) & his staff for making our stay enjoyable & memorable !!! Thanks Nusa Dua Beach Resort & Spa !!!!",
        "To quote General Douglas MacArthur - \"We shall return !!!\"",
        "If there is an outdoor jacuzzi next to the pool, it would be perfect for adult over seeing their kids at the pools",
        "We spent 9 days in Nusa Dua Beach and Spa hotel",
        "3rd time I've stayed at Nusa Dua Beach over 13 years and although it has had updates over the years, it could do with a refresh",
        "Some of the new staff are struggling and we did wait over an hour for food on 2 occasions at the same resturant, Chess",
        "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "The chess restaurant male staff i the young chap when asked about a particular dish on the taste replied he doesnt know he has never tasted it",
        "It's a great place for a couple or families to go to",

        "I will definitely go back for a weekend getaway to relax",
        "Nestled amongst other big brand name hotels, the NDBH stands out for its Balinese architecture and ambience",
        "We were sick whilst there and saw the on site nurse",
        "The hotel can arrange taxis or day drivers, but we found it easy and cheaper to arrange our own (just go down to the taxi carpark and ask",
        "We were in a suite away from the pool which we loved as it was peaceful",
        "Some people prefer being close to the pool but it depends on your preference",
        "A great hotel that we would love to come back to",
        "After spending 8 days in Legian it was a pleasure to come to NDBH and wind down",
        "Every one of our requests was met with a \"yes\" and a smile",
        "The resort grounds are beautifully landscaped and contain several gorgeous pools, 3 of which are child friendly",
        "The resort is located on a private beach with very few sellers so we were not hassled the few times we actually used the beach",
        "Other points - the rooms are serviced daily, there are minimal mozzies around (which was a huge concern for us), decent wifi, lovely staff (Ratih in guest relations is just wonderful) and a kids club that our 4",
        "Overall, if we ever return to Bali, this would be the resort we'd come back to without hesitation",
        "We had an amazing holiday, thank you so much",
        "Everything was excellent, we would love to come again! I would recommend your resort to friends and family",

        "We are planning another trip next year with family",
        "We really enjoyed our stay at NDBH",
        "The bathroom could have been cleaner and we had to request our towels almost daily",
        "The hotel charged us for in room wifi which we did not use at time of check out",
        "Which we paid, but this made it disappointing",
        "The selection of four different restaurants/cuisines to eat at was good - meaning we weren't choosing from the same menu each and every lunch and dinner we ate at the hotel",
        "It would be great if they could offer some more age-targeted activities, say something for the 7+ age group",
        "Being an Aussie, I get really irritated by prices being listed before tax and service fees",
        "That's probably not specific to this Hotel, but it gets my goat",
        "Overall, we were after an easy resort experience, and this place satisfied expectations",
        "Everything we would expect from a resort of this standard and could not find any faults with any aspect",
        "We were really able to unwind and enjoy ourselves in Nusa Dua",
        "We had a family room with King bed and one single bunk bed in attached separate room",
        "We did use room service several times and found the kids menu to be very good with well sized portions",
        "Can't wait to stay there again",
        "For a very grand hotel it boasts the atmosphere of a small boutique with all the luxuries that a larger hotel offers",
        "Food is excellent as are the rooms and facilities Nusa Dua offers, we would love to come back! A special mention to Mariani in the tourism office, without her help and amazing personality the remainder of our trip in Bali would have been slightly chaotic - she's so great",
        "A place we would certainly re visit in the near future",
        "We went to Bali to celebrate our wedding anniversary",
        "I wish to say 'Thank you' to all staff",
        "Buffet breakfast - to die for!!",
        "& so helpful, & loved the massages ! The Breakfast's were Great, and nothing was too much trouble for the excellent staff",
        "We had eight nights at this resort and was made to feel welcomed from the moment we stepped out of the transfer car into the lobby",
        "We have just got back from a 7 night stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa, which we thoroughly enjoyed! The resort was fantastic, the staff were awesome, nothing was too much trouble",

        "We loved it and will be back",
        "We had a lovely view in the mornings",
        "The bunk could be pushed down the other end of the room to give the parents some privacy as I felt I had eyes on me all night",
        "Our room service took over an hour to come then was cold and then changed us with a room delivery service fee even though it was a voucher",
        "We loved the games room and a great place to chill out in the heat",
        "We felt very safe and secure at the hotel with the beach security and the gates at the entrance were greatly appreciated",
        "I would suggest maybe having a menu A & B for people staying longer and some variety from one week to the next, esp on the kids menu",
        "Aprilla in the kids room was lovely and so caring we just found that for our kids 7 & 10 it was too young",
        "The food was average, terrible table seated as far as we could go asked for a finger bowl twice and also asked for crackers to open the crab and that never came so could not enjoy my crab",
        "We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the resort and would recommend it",
        "We have fallen in love with Bali and will be back",
        "We have just got back from a 7 night stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa, which we thoroughly enjoyed! The resort was fantastic, the staff were awesome, nothing was too much trouble",
        "We ate almost every night at the resort, probably a bit expensive but well worth it for good quality food",
        "We have just returned from a 10 night stay this time and it was perfect again",
        "During our stay, we ate at all the restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed every one, and I can recommend the Palm Mojito's at the Chess Bar! We also had massages and treatments at the Spa which were very relaxing - the Coconut body Scrub was excellent",
        "Keep up the good work \"Mr Dermot\" - it was lovely to chat to you again and hope to see you at the Rugby soon!",
        "We have just come back from 10 days here (our second time) and had a fabulous break",
        "We were a bit nervous as we had stayed before and loved it so were worried we had set too high return expectations",
        "But we needn't have worried! Our kids love the pools and met some lovely friends",
        "The staff were amazing - the kids got ear infections and we had flowers and fruit delivered to our room - a lovely personal touch",
        "We are now all in post holiday funk!",
        "but i did my lovely stay here",
        "It is huge",
        "We booked months in advance and requested early check-in, in a room on the ground floor with a view in a quiet area, not too far from reception",
        "What we got was normal check-in at 2pm, a room on the second floor, no view to speak of, with some noise at night from the entertainment in the restaurants and not too close to reception, but not the furthest away either",
        "It contributed to a very unhappy holiday",
        "We stayed 10 days and in that time we were not able to score any of the recliners",
        "The girls do fabulous massages but it is essential to book",
        "All in all we will not be using this hotel again",
        "the main hotel that we only used this once",
        "hotel about 20 min walk to Bali Collections (shops and restaurants) or shuttle from hotel, or taxi (under $3aud)",

        "We had our wedding party stay here (50 Guests) and it was great",

        "Spur of moment decision to surprise our daughter and family who we're staying here",
        "We are already planning our return",
        "Room #1151 on the ground floor close to front reception and lounge bar areas was very comfortable, clean and the aircon worked well",
        "I was lucky to stay at this great resort in March and it is probably my favourite in the Nusa Dua area",
        "Especially impressed with security when I forgot to lock my safe when going out for a day trip",
        "we have returned here for 30 years and love the gentle traditional balinese hospitality and facilities at this hotel",
        "Although it still needs to be renovated but it's very comfortable",
        "Overall this is a great hotel to stay in, for family it is a great place,",
        "We booked the hotel through Luxury Escapes and the price represented excellent value for money as it included three themed dinners, 6 spa treatments etc",
        "We went because we needed a break",
        "I trusted the travel agent",
        "Fortunately, we were not on the ground floor",
        "We heard it, but were not next to it",
        "This is OK, and it is standard in tourist traps",
        "I was picked up by the hotel car at the airport",
        "We booked a deal through Luxury Escapes for 10 days and up graded to a palace room at a cost of US$80++ per night",
        "We found that the service at chess restaurant was only ever half acceptable if the manager was in sight on two occasions we actually left the table after being ignored for an unacceptable length of time",
        "We were also very disappointed that the bathroom was not cleaned very well and the taps and marble were never wiped over, there was also a shortage of Face clothes as only once did we not have to request them",
        "The resort was nice it could just do with cleaner bathrooms",
        "so worth this option!",
        "We certainly made the right decision when we booked this holiday",
        "As we were there for ten days, we were able to try out all the restaurants and we enjoyed each and every meal",
        "I visited the spa on five occasions, as much for the treatments as for the ambiance",
        "I stayed at Nusa Dua Resort from May 27th to June 1st with my family",
        "It's a beautiful resort for a perfect holiday",
        "Very picturesque, but a warning to parents of small children, it is still a body of unfenced water!",
        "The only complaint we had about this resort is that it is very singular",
        "There is a supermarket in the complex but it had a limited range",
        "If you don't mind paying alot of money for food and drink then this is the resort for you it is truly lovely",
        "Would i stay here again? hmm thats a hard one",
        "While we really loved the hotel and the grounds",
        "I have to add that we found all staff genuinely welcoming, professional, attentive and very helpful",
        "We will definately be going back, due mostly to the wonderful treatment of all their guests",
        "Must commend the spa staff for their friendly professionalism, as well as the quality of services on offer, which we found reasonably priced",
        "We always enjoy the traditional Balinese massages, and love the exotic fragrances of the oils and scrubs",
        "We found the pools, grounds and beach to be very clean, and the sea water pleasant and crystal clear at this time of the year",
        "We also enjoyed sitting in the lobby lounges for a change of scene some evenings",
        "We liked the variety of pleasant music on offer, and were thankful it was not a nightclub scene",
        "As always, we found them to be very clean and quiet, with very comfortable beds and decorative Balinese features",
        "After spending some time at Ubud, and then a few nights with friends at Sanur, we decided to spend our last 2 nights at Nusa Dua",
        "Being on the third floor we had one floor above us, and my only complaint would be that we could hear the people in the room above scraping their chairs on the floor every time they moved them, and boy did they like to move them a lot - it was like a furniture removal convention up there",
        "There's a lovely paved walk along the beachfront which heads off in both directions and is very quiet for an early morning run - I went out at about 7",
        "A very good stay here, we actually went August 2012 but won't let me backdate it",
        "This was our honeymoon stay, we had stayed three nights in Tabanan and travelled down to Nusa Dua for the remainder of our stay of 10 nights",
        "We visited Nusa Dua centre, Kuta and Jimbaran Bay (which you must visit for the sunset in the evening it is amazing)",
        "Best decision I ever made",
        "Ok so the hotel is a lot older than those surrounding it but it had heart unlike the new sparkling sole less hotels",
        "You can take a beautiful walk along the beach to the shops which again coming from Perth we found to be very reasonable, not crowded,not hassled, no traffic unlike our trip into Kuta !",
        "The only thing I would say is don't got to the beauty saloon as their attitude sucked needless to say we did not give her any of our business",
        "If you are going to stay here which I highly recommend, look for the packages and upgrade to a suite",
        "The only downside, is that the staff follow the letter to the law and aren't always flexible but I put that down to cultural differences more than anything",
        "I would go again, but I helps that I've become a massive fan of Bali",
        "We arrived mid to late in the evening and on first impressions thought \"WOW\"",
        "We asked for a room with a king size bed",
        "As it was fairly late we then just climbed into bed to enjoy our 1st night of sound sleep",
        "It was soooo musty",
        "When we looked more closely around the room the following morning we noticed that the furniture was so marked and dirty that I would hesitate to sit on it",
        "Such a shame and once again, no where near the 5 star quality that we indeed paid for",
        "The desk staff asked if we could go and have breakfast and come back afterwards",
        "We did this and about 8",
        "We move on",
        "We loved the location, buildings, gardens, beach and pool",
        "I decided to wipe down the outside furniture on the balcony with one of the white bath towels",
        "it was then black",
        "After staying in what cost us $70 per night with clean immaculate facilities to paying $175 per night here at Nusa Dua and areas of the room that couldn't be used is not satisfactory",
        "Would I stay here again?? Um, probably yes but only if I was guaranteed a room that was cleaned and maintained to the standard it should be",
        "This hotel has so much to offer nothing is a problem , staff are so wonderful facility are outstanding level of service is second to none we can't wait to return for our 20th stay love nusa dua beach hotel and spa",
        "When we drove up to the hotel, it was very impressive! We were given an upgrade to a club room and it was fabulous! Great view of the garden, the best bathroom I have seen in a long time, with a separate toilet with a tub that opened to the bedroom! Only criticism, no where to hang your towels! The lap pool is brilliant as are the free activities offered by the gym; we did the bike ride around Nusa Dua",
        "Bali was the first place I had travelled abroad to and I was worried about it being dirty and a shock to the system in comparison to Australia - which it was - except for Nusa Dua, one of the prettiest places on the planet",
        "Employees there are lovely and after a few days I remembered the names of a few who I would pass, stop and chat to (Ery, Merta Yasa & Mushadi I am giving you my praise!)",
        "I absolutely loved its close proximity to the water, the beach was truly beautiful to wander past via the walkway between all of the hotels, and I enjoyed the short walk to the waves at the end of the resorts where I could have a dip too",
        "It did not contain views but it was still gorgeous thanks to its intricate wood work and open plan bedroom/bathroom which I wanted to go home and recreate",
        "I would recommend stepping outside of the resort and taking a short walk in to town for dinner because the food at Mai Mai is the best and I are here about 3 times",
        "The Deluxe rooms have been refurbished, so whilst it is smaller than the Premier rooms, it is newer",
        "However, some of our friends had issues with the front desk during check-in and check-out, where the room cost was already paid but was it was not reflected in the system",
        "Service during breakfast was also a bit slow, where there were a lot of tables not cleared and thus we found it challenging to find seats",
        "We have stayed at this hotel twice before and this time took advantage of a luxury escapes package to upgrade to the palace club, and loved every moment of it",
        "We will be returning as soon as possible",
        "I have just returned from a 8 night stay, at this fabulous Nus Dua beach hotel",
        "This was my 5th stay here and it just gets better every time I stay here",
        "The food and beverages have increased in price a little too much for my liking so you wander just outside and head towards Benowa where you will find loads of restauants selling Indonesian food at much cheaper fare and its yummy, I have been to Bali 15 times and always eat from little restaurants and I have never been sick",
        "Poppies Lane 1 & 2 are great but be prepared to negotiate",
        "I have a great tailor who made me a gorgeous long leather skirt and biker jacket",
        "There are 2 things I would say:-",
        "Can't help the 21% vat, but would love to know about the +20% service fee on all the bills",
        "On arrival it was clear to see that the place was stuck in the eighties when it was built",
        "On arriving in our room we were disgusted to find a filthy floor, used sanitary items on the bathroom floor and a room covered in dust and finger marks",
        "After moaning (which isn't what you want to do after an 18 hr flight) we were moved to a slightly less dirty room",
        "No way is this a five star hotel and if I wasn't here on business I would be checking out",
        "We took advantage of a Luxury Escapes package at this resort and it was just the relax and recharge we needed",
        "Yes, the shower in the bathroom has a useless rain head and we do recommend exploring eating establishments outside for the true Balinese cuisine but we would certainly stay here again",
        "It was our 1st stay at this hotel, we loved it!! The traditional Balinese style and ambiance of this hotel is very appealing and iconic, as its over 30 years old",
        "We enjoyed many happy hours in the bars by the beautiful pools",
        "We had massages and spa's in the most gorgeous setting with lovely staff pampering us!! The staff were very polite and friendly, we will definitely come back here",
        "After 14 years we returned to stay at the Nusa Nua Beach Palace Club and absolutely loved every moment of it, again",
        "It was genuinely touching to be remembered afer 14 years by several of the Palace Club staff",
        "We loved the many nights sitting near the waves with our toes in the sand having meals with close freinds at Chess bristro",
        "Room service quality was excelent at any time we ordered it",
        "Everybody so helpful and attentive and making me feel welcome and well taken care of",
        "I travelled with my husband",
        "We had a very attractive deal to stay in a Palace Club Suite",
        "What can I say? The suite, comprising a bedroom with walk in robe, full bathroom en suite and a balcony, a lounge/dining, second w/c with vanity, a (non cooking facility) kitchen and balcony on the top (4th) floor, overlooking gardens",
        "We stayed for a wonderful 12 nights and loved every minute of our holiday",
        "This is our third visit to Bali and we have stayed at a number of resorts and destinations",
        "Membership of the Palace Club is well worth the extra fees, providing visitors with an a la carte breakfast, combined with a buffet, afternoon tea for 1",
        "We spent the most of our time at the spa lap pool, where it is serene and restful",
        "Both my husband and I returned with the sense that we had enjoyed a real holiday - the first in many years",
        "We stayed for 14 nights and never once was disappointed",
        "we told the receptionist that we want a room with good view",
        "Feel so good",
        "It's my second visits in this property and a traditional Balinese resort",
        "I've spent my 2 weeks awesome experience, just Eat",
        "We have just returned from an eight day holiday at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, 1st - 9th May",
        "We purchased a package through Luxury Escapes and stayed in the Palace Club suites and were lucky enough too enjoy the excellent club facilities, including a la carte breakfast, afternoon tea and afternoon cocktails",
        "It was worth every cent",
        "Geoff & Jo",
        "To be honest, my expectation for this hotel was not that high, because I have read that this hotel is the oldest hotel in the area, but because they offer great rate, I decided to try",
        "And I was not disappointed",
        "I stayed in the room premier class",
        "The wooden decoration inside the room was beautiful, I am sure it cost a lot of money to have such marvelous decor",
        "I have to give my greatest appreciation for the staff",
        "It made me feel really welcomed",
        "We had the best holiday ever",
        "We were 2 couples staying at the hotel in May 2014 for ten nights",
        "We loved the place",
        "Yes it is a bit older than probably lots of others but hey it was comfortable and had everything we needed",
        "We stocked up on local beers and water at a nearby market as I dislike paying through the nose for simple things at resorts",
        "We loved the pool area and the ability to chill out under a lovely old tree under the beach",
        "Drinks are expensive as per usual but hey pre dinner drinks back in the rooms followed by after dinner drinks on the beach using our own drinks makes it a pleasant affair",
        "We all took advantage of our free massages",
        "We had a late flight out of Bali so used the spa facilities until it was time for our car to the airport",
        "It is only 20,000-30,000 rupiah to get there",
        "We just about always used Blue bird taxis when travelling",
        "I would definitely go back to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa again",
        "Bit of mould in the bathroom but we are in a very humid climate so it is everywhere anyway",
        "It's in dire need of renovation, after which it may be a candidate",
        "Needs re-doing",
        "What we did was get friendly with a local taxi driver and get his phone number",
        "Everything is as advertised, except that it all looks very tired and need refreshing",
        "Bathroom is nicely laid out and appointed, but water pressure was so low that whowering was painful",
        "Currently, it is sufficient, not 5 star",
        "Would definitely love to return to it",
        "Overall just an AMAZING EXPERIENCE :)",
        "It's a very well maintained property with lots to explore",
        "it's a heaven for the swimmers with multiple pool options facing the beach",
        "it is situated in a peaceful area with lush green surroundings",
        "I stayed in the hotel for 5 days with my wife and 2 year old daughter",
        "Somebody might have an opinion that it gives a feel of old balinese style",
        "I did not face any issues during the stay",
        "It shouldn't just meet the expectations but exceed it",
        "While I didn't face any issue, I don't have any extraordinary instance or gesture to talk about as well",
        "We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights (from 23 March 2014)",
        "In the bathroom the standard of finish was pretty poor and there were minor problems with the sink (it leaked a bit and it was difficult to get the plug to remain down)",
        "We did enjoy our stay at the hotel but were a little disappointed in the standard of the accommodation (i",
        "It is located brilliantly on nusa dua beach, with a great private stretch of beach just in front of it that it shares with the westin resort",
        "On the downside, the housekeeping and room service takes inordinate time and often we found we had to wait more than 30-45 minutes for simple things like a matchbox or an iron board to be delivered to our room",
        "Also the aircon in the room is just too warm and uncomfortably hot",
        "In the time it's taken me to write this I've had 3 breakfast staff (palace club) come to attend to me! Now that's service! The resort is huge, with vast green areas",
        "We usually stay in Legian 5* but coming into the NDBH we have been in heaven",
        "The spa here is exactly as the brochure describes, now we all know that never happens, you walk or should I say float back to your room",
        "It's so magical here I've called my husband and told him to book a flight for next week with the kids 7 & 9 and come over, that way I can get another week here too! My female friend and I are certainly coming back and it would be a still be a relaxing pleasurable holiday with the family here!",
        "We stayed in this wonderful hotel in March 2014 for 9 nights after 4 nights in Singapore",
        "We were greeted by the Manager of the hotel and made to feel very welcome from the moment we stepped out of the taxi",
        "Cannot fault this hotel, there are renovation works being carried out but they did not interfere with our stay at all, in fact they were so discrete we only found out about them whilst going for a walk one morning",
        "Other travellers, including one who is a syndicated travel writer admitted to this being their favourite hotel in Bali, and we understood why",
        "We bought a package (see their website) that included accommodation, shows, dinners, hour long spa treatments, and it was amazing value",
        "We both felt amazingly healthy, beautiful and rejuvenated at the end of our stay",
        "We were invited to some beautiful events, including the hotel's own Nyepi ( Day of Silence and Balinese New Year) ceremony in the hotel's home temple",
        "We simply fell in love with this place",
        "The NDBH & S simply is, as it says, the best of Bali",
        "We shall return!",
        "As a 'solo' traveller, I have nothing but praise for my experience staying at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "I had a most enchanting, relaxing and blissful six short days! Being a true 'Ballinese' design hotel of some 30 gracious years, the gardens are quite simply magnificent and seemingly wherever one looks, there are beautiful, mature gardens",
        "For me, this hotel is one I will quite happily return to",
        "We returned this time with our 2 children (14 yo daughter & 17 yo son), and another family couple",
        "The appeal of the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is that over the years it has remained true to the Balinese culture which is reflected in the beautiful Balinese carvings (including the rooms), the stunning & well maintained gardens and the overall architecture",
        "We we found them to be as clean as other (unnamed ) 5 star hotels in Bali",
        "With the hotel running at full capacity over the Easter break, you would not know it other than at the breakfast bar",
        "We felt the Spa was of very high quality and even better than some we have attended at other (unnamed) 5 star resorts",
        "We would rate it 4",
        "It would be our first choice in Nusa Dua",
        "My partner and I stayed here after we scored a deal via Luxury Escapes",
        "We selected a Palace Club room for 8 nights",
        "We arrived late and were checked in swiftly in the Palace Club area and retired after a long day of boozing and flying :)",
        "We did both and we not disappointed in either",
        "They have 'real' coffee in both Areas - at the Buffett you have to make it yourself at the excellent espresso dispenser but oh to have a good latte in Bali was a god-send!",
        "I can't imagine how difficult it would be to get a massive Buffett for a hundred or so people right, and though the food was not perfect it was enjoyable",
        "I had the curry, but asked for chicken instead of barramundi and OH MY LORD DELICIOUS",
        "I had it twice",
        "I was really touched by this - so so thoughtful",
        "I was treated for a fee which was reasonable and which I can claim in travel insurance (don't leave home without it)",
        "I spent the day watching movies in bed but the next day I was up and about and ready for fun",
        "Seriously, fork out for one in the spa (30% off in the morning - but ours were included - I know, great deal)",
        "Or get a taxi elsewhere it will be cheaper",
        "It was really expensive and possibly the worst massage I've ever had",
        "It was so disinterested",
        "The lady didn't like it that I didn't want to buy a sarong from her, I suppose",
        "Or sit at a cafe and watch the wold go by",
        "It is run by Bali Collection, a yucky shopping tourist compound nearby that has a supermarket but we spent 20 minutes there and left",
        "The bathroom although a little tired was more than adequate and suited us fine",
        "Because this place is set on 23 acres it didn't seem busy even thought it was fully booked most nights",
        "We spent time walking around the many garden areas and taking time to sit in the many shaded areas and read our books",
        "We found this hotel to be great for relaxing and lounging around the pool or beach with ample towels supplied and plenty of sun lounges",
        "A very nice touch was on our arrival we had a fruit basket and 12 red roses in a vase as we told them we were having a wedding anniversary during our stay",
        "Staying at many hotels we were very impressed with the breakfast bar here",
        "All in all we loved the place and would definitely return again",
        "It fits the bill nicely",
        "Was tough to decide between Nusa Dua and Sanur which are both quite different so we chose both with 4 nights here and 2 nights in Sanur (not worth mentioning which hotel) and wished we had longer at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "We stayed in the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for 10 days",
        "This is quite disappointed since we book this hotel because it seems to be very relaxing and resort like",
        "At the end we could not relax in the room, making sure that the TV was not loud, trying not to make too much noise, amongst others",
        "There are very nice places outside of the hotel where we could have a better meal, and with a much better price and quality",
        "We could rate the restaurants and bars as average",
        "The sports facilities are good, but we thought ridiculous the fact that we had to pay for everything! It is ok to pay a fee to rent a squash or tennis material, but paying for classes such as aerobics, yoga?! That should be complementary to the hotel guests!",
        "I will miss seeing this view every morning!",
        "Restaurants- we ate at Maguro Asian restaurant 3 nights out of our 5 night stay",
        "It was outstanding! (And I had my fussy partner with me)",
        "Simple flavours but they got it spot on",
        "nusa dua is somewhat isolated so eating options are limited hence why we ate at hotel a lot",
        "Hopefully you will enjoy this place as much as we did! :)",
        "Room was lovely overlooking the gardens, and we even got a daily visit on our balcony from the local squirrels",
        "The Spa facilities were amazing, we had massages every second day and felt like royalty throughout the experience",
        "It is noted that in the Spa area NO CHILDREN under 12yo, allowed",
        "One drawback for us was a family with children were accommodated in the floor above us which resulted in us being moved due to the excessive noise",
        "This is what we should have done to alleviate the inconvenience and stress it created",
        "All in all a lovely holiday just disappointed with issues regarding the noise factor and the inconvenience it created",
        "Being one of the oldest it maintains that exuberence in service and standards",
        "We loved the food and cocktails",
        "Close to all local attractions it was a memorable stay for our party",
        "We have just come back from another lovely time at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "There was eight of us this time and we really had a wonderful time",
        "I did only give 4 stars this time where in the past it was always 5",
        "I will look for this deal next time I stay",
        "Comparing to the rest of South Kuta, you do feel like you are out of no where, but for family holidays and novice travelers to Bali or South East Asia, it is perfect, the resort has almost everything one needs and it's in a safe and well manicured (but man made) part of Bali",
        "I would have rate the hotel 3",
        "5/5 if it was available, it is most likely a good fit for family, honeymooners and more novice Asian travelers, just not for us",
        "But for us, we will surely return to staying in Seminyak/Legian Area",
        "We have recently returned from the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa",
        "We used a promotion from deals",
        "It will cost you around 90,000Rp or less than AU$10 in a bluebird to Kuta",
        "Those travelling to Bali, this is a great tool to use as it will save you around an hour through customs and immigration",
        "It is upmarket but is not as expensive as I thought and we would be happy to stay in Nusa Dua it again without hesitation",
        "We were two couples visiting Bali and stayed here for a week in their Palace Club rooms",
        "I was surprised by the really nice and hospitable attitude of not just the management but each and every employee",
        "We had lots of in with an underwater camera at the pool",
        "Beautiful hotel, gorgeous grounds, fantastic pools - thank goodness, given it was over 32 degrees with well over 90% humidity each day we were there! We were only in Bali for five full days, and spent two and a half of them lazing by (and in) the pool",
        "The rooms were the only air conditioned areas we noticed, but that was fine as we became accustomed to the heat",
        "The food in the restaurants was good, but not great, and more expensive than we expected",
        "We also kept forgetting to add the extra 21% tax, so usually ended up with a higher bill than expected",
        "We stayed for 5 days",
        "Had 4th floor room (top floor) and it had a lovely view of pool and beach",
        "The staff were friendly, but this hotel is so big it loses character and familiar faces, making it impersonal",
        "My sister and I had a very relaxing stay here while we toured around Bali with our private guide",
        "We arranged for our guide separately when we were in Singapore",
        "At the last moment while we were there, we wanted to see Uluwatu but couldn't get in touch with our own guide so the hotel arranged another guide to take us there",
        "It was a little pricey but totally worth it",
        "I talked him into this trip with quite a bit of persuasion",
        "He did not know that there was a side to Bali like this, now he has no problem going s a quick getaway",
        "We will be going back",
        "We stayed at Nusa Dua during Christmas holidays so it was extremely crowded",
        "we also tried the Spa",
        "We have been a reular travellers all our lives and always stay in 5 Star hotels",
        "All the saff are good but we noticed Nula ( Hope I have spelt this right) always seemed genuinly pleased to see us",
        "We recently stayed at this icon of the Nusa Dua area having first been there in 1984",
        "We will be back!!! John and Pat",
        "I have to call one of them and asked for menu",
        "I asked for an omelet and thanked the staff after received one",
        "Yes it's a very old hotel but I dont know it still on my priority hotel list to come when I visit to Nusa Dua area in Bali",
        "Gladly I stayed at the palace club room I could access to their palace club lounge and get unlimited drinks service at any time",
        "from 3-5 pm I could enjoy the afternoon tea with cake and canape and then a wine experience with canape starting from 6 or 7 pm I forgot",
        "How can I not describe about The Spa, ahh felt so relaxing and a Nusa Dua Full Massage treatment gave me another booster to my body and it was excellent",
        "I could not get enough of their Ginger Tea, good things it was there for compliment because I loved it so much haha",
        "I think I'm gonna come back to experience more of their hospitality again and again",
        "highly recommend this for family (we have 3&5 year old)",
        "We promise to be back soon",
        "Love you guys x",
        "That's why we keep coming back",
        "I cannot speak too highly of the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "It was a most appreciated gesture",
        "With the squirrels that come to feed from your balcony it is a wonderful retreat",
        "I certainly intend to visit again and have no hesitation in recommending this resort-hotel to others",
        "Terrible service as 4",
        "And the hotel made me wait for more than 2 hours (13:00-15:30) without any explanation",
        "Finally the hotel made me change my booking room and provided two connecting rooms",
        "Nine times we have holidayed in Bali, our first time to Nusa Dua Beach Resort and it has been exceptional",
        "We Have enjoyed every minute staying here",
        "Will we return",
        "Yes we have already made the reservation!",
        "The weather was pretty wet in May but it did not spoil the holiday",
        "We would love to go back",
        "Breakfast was incredible each morning !! Great location close to the beach",
        "We stayed here for 14 nights in March",
        "Squirrels come down from the trees to be fed and are realy quite tame even had a couple outside on the balcony who knew every time we walked back into our room",
        "Lobby bar which is open until 2 am is great but again lighting not to good especialy in outside smoking area",
        "Although 30 years old, we were made to feel very much at home",
        "Set amongst beautiful gardens with traditional Balinese decor (unlike others), we found it to be very relaxing",
        "We ate all our meals in the hotel restaurants, didn't get sick and enjoyed evenings listening to musicians in the lobby bar or overlooking the beach",
        "I had a particularly stress-free time - I use a manual wheelchair and cannot walk",
        "I was totally spoilt by the hotel staff, and will definitely be returning again! PS The breakfast 'banquet' was just amazing!!! Thankyou! :-)",
        "We will stay here again",
        "We really enjoyed our short stay here",
        "It was the low season so the hotel wasn't at capacity which I am sure contributed to my good experience",
        "The best aspect of our stay was that we were permitted to continue to use the hotels facilities even after check out",
        "Our flight was not until 10pm but we continued to enjoy the pool, spa and restaurants until we had to go to the airport",
        "They insist putting only 2 bottles of water to the room which is obviously not enough in that whether, so we had to call every time we need water to get refilled 2 bottles again",
        "Concierge was really helpful although the driver that they booked for us took us ridiculously expensive shops where they tried to sell a wooden carving to 2,800 USD where we bought the same to 60 USD elsewhere",
        "In conclusion, it's a very nice resort",
        "Bali was our favorite destination from the 5 Asian cities we visited",
        "The main hobby, restaurants, room in good condition except for the bathroom and therefore I would grade this to be a 4 star not a 5 star",
        "From the first moment we arrived we were impressed by the sight of our entrance",
        "We stayed 8 nights in total",
        "The gardens are immaculate, this would be the cleanest resort we have ever stayed at",
        "Hotel is impressive at the first moment, it's made like a copy of Balinese palace",
        "Nice spa with additional pool, saunas, whirlpool, where we mostly were along",
        "I was able to try three types of room classes during my stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa",
        "I have some comments on each of the room classes, and the hotel as a whole",
        "The bathrooms are nice, but there is a problem with the tile work as it was not considered utility wise, aesthetically beautiful but functionally it creates an unpleasant experience",
        "Management Dika in particular and Staff are wonderful",
        "I would recommend this hotel for people looking for a non commercial experience",
        "However, I opted to upgrade to a Palace suite as for peace of mind I prefer a room on a higher floor when travelling solo",
        "Most impressive so far has been the Palace Club",
        "It comprised a slice of cold aubergine, a slice of cold tomato topped with a little lukewarm cheese",
        "I also overheard another guest remaking on the lack of sauce on her cannelloni",
        "I can't believe I am sitting just feet from a tropical landscaped pond with resident heron and monitor lizards and not a single mosquito",
        "I have stayed at other hotels in Nusa Dua and this is the only one that I want to return to",
        "I stayed with my 2 sisters for 5 nights",
        "Not so positive",
        "One night we did have amazing service at the International restaurant though!",
        "Overall it was a great resort and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!",
        "We stayed at this hotel for a quick weekend trip",
        "To the other tourists: please don't take a stack of slice bread (9 pieces) and throw them to the fishes",
        "It's embarrassing to see fellow tourist act like complete rude idiots by cutting lines, hovering over tables and yelling",
        "Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I would not hesitate to come back again, if ever I should visit wonderful Bali",
        "We had heard varying things about Bali",
        "It is amazing",
        "The traditional dances are great - definitely a must to see",
        "We will definitely come back to this little piece of paradise",
        "This is our first trip in Bali, we happened to get the package from Luxury Escapes",
        "We didn't even bother to get out for dinner, because the restaurants offer the food that we liked",
        "Its a place we would recommend to our friends! The staff were always polite and with smiles! Thank you so much, we had a perfect holiday!",
        "It was a truly wonderful experience",
        "As part of the Palace club we were welcomed to delicious breakfast, afternoon teas and cocktails in the evening",
        "It was our first time in Bali and we just want to keep coming back again and again",
        "This was our third stop in Bali, and it was wonderful",
        "I would highly recommend this hotel",
        "We stayed at the Nusa Dua Hotel in January for our Honeymoon and it was the best decision we made",
        "The resort is beautifully manicured, the staff are so friendly and made us feel very welcomed",
        "We want to go back there every year to celebrate our anniversary!",
        "From the moment we walked through the door however, we may as well have been paying a million dollars a night",
        "We both loved the pools and restaurant facilities",
        "There was so much variety of food and drink that we didn't have enough time to try it all",
        "Would definately recommend for other visitors and I will be looking to return myself",
        "We stayed in a Palace Club Room",
        "I left Singapore trying to escape the noise and was not happy to find a building site next door",
        "It was our fault - we enjoyed feeding these little critters! They were brilliant",
        "Frogs are everywhere and we had fun frog hunting",
        "It was just such a shame about the noise",
        "We used the spa and had a couples package",
        "The mosquitoes were a little bit of a pest, so the shared bath wasn't as enjoyable as it could have been",
        "I read a couple of mediocre reviews and was hesitant about the place",
        "Well, I don't know where they were staying but it certainly wasn't The Nusa Dua Hotel and Spa where we stayed",
        "The age of the Hotel seems to be an issue for people but I found that it gave the place more genuine character and authenticity than the more newly built resorts",
        "Each to their own, I suppose",
        "We visit Bali often, but this was my first trip to Nusa Dua - and we WILL be back! The resort grounds are beautiful and the rooms comfortable - although a little out dated",
        "The bed is amazingly comfortable and I considered trying to smuggle some of the pillows home in my suitcase! The pools are great, and even though the resort looked to have many rooms there was always a chair free to lay in",
        "Both the kids club and the playground (which are not close together) need an upgrade, but apart from that we enjoyed our stay",
        "As soon as our driver drove into the resort we were in love! It is so beautiful and the staff were so welcoming and friendly",
        "The resort is large, it has so many rooms and yet the pool was never crowded and we certainly were not rubbing shoulders with other guests",
        "Our daughter was so in love with the room that we decided not to say anything about it",
        "We had massages included also",
        "We used the drivers from the resort and they were fabulous, very knowledgeable and we felt in safe hands with them",
        "However I would highly recommend booking some tours through the resort",
        "We booked the Bali Safari and Marine Park through the resort and it included everything including transport and lunch",
        "Our daughter celebrated her birthday while we were at the resort",
        "We then waited for a room for 45 minutes",
        "When we asked whether the offer was available I was told a flat no without any explanation",
        "Ok so it's only been half a day, so I may be critiquing a little early but I couldn't help myself",
        "We also quickly noticed the vast arrange of activites and classes to do",
        "But it didn't take long to change our moods",
        ") The floor in room is so slippery I've slipped over once already and have had a few other close calls",
        ") The pool was moldy and pretty gross, it was very hard to find a place to sit in the shade and cocktails were also expensive and crap",
        "This Hotel is over 30 years old and it shows in the beautiful mature grounds and architecture",
        "We loved our stay in the Palace Club room with great food and service",
        "I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to anyone",
        "When we first enter the room we realized that there were insects everywhere, the sheets and the curtain had dirty spots and overall it wasn't a nice room either",
        "So we got back to the reception and they gave us an upgraded room, which was not only clean and beautiful, with great view, but we could enter the room directly from the beach and pool aria",
        "This hotel is pricier than other places in Bali we have stayed, but we thought it was worth it",
        "We stayed at Nusa Dua Beach for 8 days & from the second we landed in Bali airport & saw the transfer driver with our name on his card it was heaven",
        "My partner & I do not travel in style generally, preferring instead an authentic experience (that is mainly due to our limited budgets & means back packers & campervans & bargains)",
        "There is a shopping center which houses some very nice shops but not really the balinese experience, this is of course as it is aimed at the top end clientele which is also fine, we had fish pedicures here & used the shopping centre to buy water & beer & snacks for our room & for our day trips",
        "The Hotel itself is one of the first to be build at Nusa Dua but you would not know it was 20 years old, it adds to its charm, it is well established & the landscaped gardens, pool & balcony growth as gorgeous",
        "Our room was upgrade & we had a king size bed & a private balcony the air conditioning was excellent for sleeping & although we didn't spend many daylight hours in our room it would be very comfortable to do so",
        "The staff were just lovely, polite, well spoken & would do ANYTHING in their power to please",
        "This was not a problem for us though as we were so tired each day (mostly from doing nothing) we slept like babies",
        "As part of our package we had 6 treatments included",
        "I LOVED each one of them",
        "On the one occasion that happened to me I headed down to the beach & had a 30 minute massage on the beach instead :)",
        "We ventured out many times during our stay & found it very easy to obtain a driver (who we paid directly)",
        "We paid a driver 400,000 rupiah ($40AU) for 8 hours to visit tennah lot & ulawatu, he waited for us & helped us navigate the culture (the cheeky monkeys) & our surroundings",
        "We left an iPhone 5 in his car on another short trip which he promptly returned to the hotel for them to give to us, it was in the hotel managers hand before we even knew it was missing!!",
        "KUTA was a complete disappointment, we intended to spend the day there, shop & eat & drink etc",
        "They hassled & followed us even after we were polite & said 'no thank you' many times",
        "(coming from South Australia we have some amazing beaches & this was a disappointment) We were so grateful to re-enter Nusa Dua & head straight to the beach & calm down",
        "We spent two weeks at the NSBH and simply loved it!",
        "I felt I got the same quality in cheaper places",
        "We had an amazing stay and loved every second of the experience",
        "We have just spent 4 glorious days at Nusa Dua Hotel Palace Club",
        "We had a suite and found it to be very comfortable",
        "The beds and pillows were great and we all slept well",
        "We felt safe and secure and already planning our next visit, but next time we will stay longer",
        "We look forward to meeting up with the lovely staff also ,congratulions to all of them",
        "Went to Bali from 12Jan to 18Jan14",
        "it was my brother wedding",
        "I love it and is clean as each day the housekeeping clean it",
        "I hv try all the restaurant at the hotel",
        "00 per bottel",
        "It was quite safe in Bali, much better than Malaysia",
        "We had a wonderful week here",
        "The room was always cleaned when we were out",
        "50 massage I had a flower in the street",
        "We experienced excellent services of NDBH starting right from the airport pickup",
        "And NDBH is just what we want!",
        "As one of the first resort in Nusa Dua, the facilities and rooms could see the age, However it is well taken care of",
        "We were staying in the palace club room, and we feel the services we got well worth the extra we paid for this type of room",
        "As it was still chinese new year period, it was crowed in general",
        "however in the palace club we still enjoyed the quietness and some privacy",
        "Again I must mention the service in the palace club, excellent!",
        "We enjoyed them very much",
        "It was a lovely stay for all family, very relaxed,peaceful and enjoyable!",
        "An English speaking driver came to pick up and we went to the Hotel through newly constructed way",
        "It was much more comfortable than taxi",
        "Pity that the exchange rate was really high and I paid IDR300,000 for USD25",
        "I should pay it by USD instead of IDR",
        "Restrants are all nice and not so expensive",
        "We stayed at the resort in July 2013",
        "probably not worth it",
        "I was pleasantly impressed with this hotel",
        "I'm not normally a fan of exclusive areas developed at the expense of poorer areas in a 3rd world county and normally stay in the Legian area for a more genuine Balinese experience",
        "Value for money was good when we went in low season",
        "The spa was unbelievably great, once we went there we swam in its secluded pool every afternoon",
        "Overall a great place would go again if not staying in Legian",
        "Upon arrival at the Nusa Dua Hotel, severe illness struck and I called for a doctor to come to the room",
        "Second - Thank you, to the duty manager \"Dika\" who stayed with me for an hour to look after my children as I was completely unable to",
        "Third - I received follow up phone calls from staff until my husband arrived to check that we were all ok",
        "On top of this, I had left my camera unattended in the hotel and it wasn't to be found again",
        "These are the sort of things that can and do go wrong when on holidays and this is the sort of place I want to be when travelling with children",
        "I unfortunately didn't get to eat much whilst there but what I did have was lovely",
        "One other point of interest (which I also didn't get to fully enjoy)",
        "I strongly recommend it to all",

        "Also give the Chess Restaurant on the beach front a miss",

        "It's a good base to explore interesting/authentic parts of Bali",

        "We booked the Nusa Dua Beach Hot e based on the very good reviews we read on Trip advisor and Booking",
        "On the bright side, the staff are really helpful and welcoming but I would definitely chose another hotel next time I come to Bali",

        "We've stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel three times now and will be returning again next year",
        "If you can afford it, the club offers some handy benefits (cocktails and afternoon tea), but depends on how much time you spend at the hotel, compared with shopping or on the beach (we spent lots of time in the hotel by the pool)",
        "If you plan to party and go out each night, you might be better off in Kuta or Legian, but fi you want five star service with each beach and pool access, it's a great option",
        "This time, after a multi-million dollar upgrade and refurbishment, we were delighted with the whole experience",
        "Not a huge deal as we didn't really spend too much time in the room anyway",
        "We booked a 3 night stay in the Agung Suite ($800 AUD per night) & were upgraded to the amazing 'Nusa Dua Suite' - the President of Japan had stayed in it prior to us for the APEC Meeting in Bali",

        "For the remainder of our stay I remedied the problem by pulling the bad cover down over the end of the bed to cover the sharpish protrusions",

        "it would be wiser choice to rent a car to get around",
        "Breakfast is ordinary which could be served by 3-4 stars hotel, they will charge you for ordering fruit juices other than papaya and watermelon juices, while daily served breakfast is limited and menu is exactly the same everyday, i get bored with the served breakfast on the 3rd day while i stayed at the hotel",

        "We very much enjoyed our stay at the hotel",
        "There is only wi-fi available in the lobby area and most of the time it didn't work properly which was definitely not what we expected from such a high-class hotel",
        "Do no expect to see the \"real\" Bali - but certainly a nice relaxing place",

        "We travelled through Java with our private guide Sonny and driver Hudda",
        "And when we arrived in Nusa Dua, it was the perfect finish of this holiday",
        "We started off early from a rainy Kalibaru to cross the sea by boat and then further on land by car to Nusa Dua",
        "It was a long, long way! And when you end up in a place like Nusa Dua, it's almost perfect",
        "We stayed for 5 nights in 1999, then again in 2003, & then lastly,2012 shortly after their $Multi-Million Dollar refit of the Hotel",
        "It is more traditional than the huge American Luxury Hotels built around it, giving a cool feel about it, & the beautiful Gardens are a real treat to wander through, relaxing & enchanting",
        "We had a beautiful corner Suite, on the 1st Floor, overlooking the pools & beach, we could have gone for a grand, ground floor Suite with it's own splash pool on the patio, which looked great, but we were very pleased with our choice of Suite, due to the view, which the ground floor one didn't have, as it had a wall around the splash pool",
        "The reception area is spectacular, with a long bar behind it to one side, where it is cool & relaxing, & gives a view over the lagoon to the Dining area, reached by large stepping stones from the outside, or a lovely cool corridor from the inside",

        "Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa it's a big hotel area",
        "In the morning me and my father take a walk at the side of the beach there's a pedestrian path and jogging track and it's connecting to other hotels so it's a long walk around 20 minutes",
        "The breakfast was great I like it, there's a lot even and I can ordered Benedict eggs ^^ it's so great to stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa",
        "Check in was pretty shaky as we arrived at 2:30 and still had to wait 1 1/2 hours for our rooms to be made up",
        "What we got was a tiny sliver of a view of the ocean",
        "We went to the Nusa Dua area because it was the end of a long trip after Hong Kong and Bangkok and wanted low stress and quiet",
        "We're glad we spent 3 nights in Ubud beforehand for a more 'real' experience",
        "In this day and age it's unforgivable for a resort of this class not to provide such a basic service",

        "keep it up",
        "It did and more",
        "With 300 or so rooms its a big hotel but its well laid out and we found it to be very affordable",
        "If you are arriving in Bali on a late flight and want a couple of nights to settle in before heading north it's perfect",
        "The best thing about the hotel - it is just so easy",
        "We stayed in a second floor premier room with twin beds overlooking the garden and duck pond, and got a great deal on one of the booking websites suggested by Tripadvisor",
        "When we checked in about 3",
        "We were offered a welcome drink in the bar and after a while I politely asked if we could have a couple of complimentary beers while we waited",
        "By then it was 4",
        "30 though and the room was ready",
        "Because they knew we were frustrated by the wait, when we got back to our room after dinner there were vouchers there for us to have a one hour Balinese massage each in their beautiful spa",
        "And so yummy! We ate in all 4 restaurants and also had room service, and enjoyed them all",
        "We also had some great (and cheaper) meals at Bali Collection (20 min walk along the footpath on the beach)",
        "We took taxis in there for shopping and some meals but were always so glad to come home to Nusa Dua where it is clean and feels very safe",
        "We paid about 110,000 rupiah for a taxi to Legian (30-40 mins)",
        "We are already preparing to book again for next year :)",
        "The drinks and food is a little pricey here, but if you have the money to stay there it shouldn't be an issue",
        "Like all Nusa Dua hotel's it's not the \"real Bali\" and that's fine I've been there several times and didn't expect an authentic experience",
        "The only choice is the business center which is soo slow and what's worse they have \"free\" wireless in the lobby but it is so bad and the entire population of the hotel is huddled around it that it can take 40 minutes for an email to open! Only about 10% of the rooms are even sea view",
        "This was our first holiday without our three young children and we wanted to stay somewhere peaceful and luxurious",
        "We stayed in a Garden View room with very close access to the beach and pool",
        "Although the room was a little small it was always cleaned by lunchtime and suited us as a couple",
        "It was a little slow, however available if needed",
        "I had one spa treatment which was very good but not the best I've ever had",
        "It only takes about 15 minutes to get there and its a nice beach walk",
        "We took a cab from the hotel and although it takes 45 mins each way it was worth the trip out",
        "All up, we certainly would return again and we would take our children to this hotel",
        "We had a wonderful time",
        "There was a huge tv with lots of channels and choice",
        "I had a wonderful stay, and found the hotel to be everything I wanted for a relaxing, romantic honeymoon",
        "We used the shuttle bus or walked to the Bali collection most nights, when weather was calm (We had room service one night during a really heavy storm which we found well priced and delicious)",

        "I would recommend getting a manicure or a massage",
        "We ate and mai mai a few times",
        "We also did a few excursions while in Bali",
        "However beware of telling the local taxi drivers your plans, as we were wrongly picked up and took on the wrong elephant trip, by a local taxi driver by unwittingly telling one of our plans the next day",
        "This experience did leave a sour taste in my mouth but we were unaware until we returned to the hotel and our guide wanted to know why we weren't picked up",
        "There were lots of security check point about nusa dua, which are normal however as president Obama was due to stay in the hotel next to us the following week security was abnormally high but again not rude or intrusive and made me feel very safe",
        "We visited Kuta which we found to be busy, commercialised and grubby, lots of young surfers and party groups about",
        "Very glad we did not stay in this area",
        "We experienced lots of the \"real\" Bali by taking tours and bought lots of local crafts from little villages rather than gift shops",
        "We understand that the part of Bali we stayed is not the real Bali and rather idealistic, but as holiday makers rather than travellers, we found it beautiful, safe, luxurious and romantic",
        "U can walk to Westin and use their restaurant",
        "We were lucky",
        "We got upgraded",
        "I will definitely go back there again",
        "We stayed here with my family(son and grand daughter)",
        "I enjoy very much the beach",
        "30 till 10",
        "This breakfast leaves a similar type we had in the Flamingo Hilton Las Vegas",
        "2) Twice a week the hotel has folk music until 9 pm",
        "It was our first time to stay in Nusa Dua and I don't think I will be back again",
        "But it is too big and commercialized to feel fully relaxed",
        "I felt like I was staying in an amusement park",

        "It was absolutely beautifully",
        "It was quite and clean",

        "We made our reservation via the hotel website and had a quick response email confirming our booking",
        "30am we were concerned that we might not get access to our room until the official check-in time of 3",
        "00pm, but as the hotel was not heavily booked staff had, without being asked, assigned us a room straight away; very much appreciated",
        "During our visit we witnessed and took part in two releases of baby turtles, the first relocated from Kuta beach and the second from a nest on the hotels beachfront",
        "We can thoroughly recommend staying here and will certainly do so next time we visit Bali",

        "The food prices were a bit higher than we had expected ( but probably to be expected at a five star hotel and with our poor exchange rate ) so we went into town most nights for dinners but the one night we went to the seafood buffet and fire dance at the hotel and it was excellent ! The breakfasts were amazing ! The hotel sent a lovely bouquet of flowers to my room on my birthday and when my son was sick with Dengue fever for our last few days there, the hotel sent fruit and flowers to his room as well",
        "I have been very fortunate to have been to this resort a few times, and I still love it",
        "There are so many resorts in nusa dua but this stands out because it looks more Balinese and its not full off kids",

        "The food was not very good at the restaurants but this was not a problem as we went out to eat",
        "The highlights were the good service by Anni at the tour desk - the diving/cruise with Bali Hai is awesome & not to be missed! Also dinner at Jimbaran is a must do! Nothing about this hotel is particularly special- & we would not return",
        "So, I have to go to the hotel's lobby for the free wifi connection and do my work",
        "What did I enjoyed in the hotel? There room is great, pool is huge, spa area is nice (but I had no time to experience the services) beach front is clean and not crowded, people are nice",

        "Great for weddings (we witnessed two) or special occasions: milestone birthdays/anniversaries",

        "There is a long line of hotels along the beach, so first evening I recommend going for a walk along the waterfront to check out other hotels and their numerous restaurants/bars",
        "very bad - pool closes at 7 pm",
        "Of the three hotels, Nusa Dua was the one I was most nervous about, following some of the reviews I'd read in TripAdvisor",
        "Well, we had nothing to fear",
        "It probably helped that we arrived at the very start of the season (April 2013) so it was very quiet",
        "Very few families with children and not the 'mass resort' that I feared from some reviews",
        "The biggest I've ever been to",
        "It's one of a number of very large hotels along the beach, all side-by-side",

        "You don't feel that it's 30 years old! Room was comfy",
        "Restaurant food was good but pricey (similar to all the hotels in Nusa Dua I guess)",
        "It has a selection of Western and Easter breakfast choices",
        "This might be a good hotel for someone but I dont think so! This'll is our second visit to Bali and after our first very good hotel this one looks awful!",
        "I agree that the overall the gardens looks nice and there are several restaurants but for less than one day there we have paid more than for we have for at least 2 days in Seminyak! We have diner in Italian restaurant , order few things as we ware not hungry (only our 4 years old doughter was hungry) but pay as for regular diner! And the food was not good",
        "I do not recommend this hotel!",
        "Thanks also for the management, we received free upgrade from deluxe to club room",
        "Now for the flaws : breakfast quality is ok, but variety must be improved, our room is humid, the tile in our room is very moist, the bed sheet is a bit moist, probably caused by the old aircon",

        "We stayed there for 4nights,the location is perfect for retreat and relaxing,we didn't have to leave the hotel,great variety breakfast buffet plus 4restaurants",

        "We stayed at here for 10 days in April 2013",
        "As someone coming from north America (where we can safely drink tap water for free just about anywhere), it's a bit hard to come to terms with paying 2 or 3$ for a water when already paying a premium for a meal",

        "Stayed in this hotel for 4 days 3 nights on 29/03 - 01/04, I would say this hotel met my expectation",
        "Located in Nusa Dua, altho far from the shopping district, it does offer the guest a nice and peaceful environment",
        "The good thing with the beach is it's connected to the adjacent hotels through a jogging track along the beach, a very nice way to enjoy your morning/afternoon walk",
        "Breakfast was okay, but being an Indonesian and staying in a hotel in Indonesia, I was expecting a few Indonesian dishes here but I found none",
        "Price is alrite, standard 5-star hotel rates, not as expensive as a few other hotels, but it does the 5-star basic right",

        "There is nothing but hotels and although the hotel is lovely we prefer eating in other resaurants and doing shopping",
        "They have different dance/dinners on a weekly schedule and we went to the Keckak dance and very much enjoyed watching the lovely dance while eating a huge meal (24 AUD pp) The beach was nice and we enjoyed getting drinks and food while relaxing on the deck chairs",
        "There is squirrels everywhere and we enjoyed watching them and even feeding them some fruit, probably not the best idea though because we did get scratched twice",
        "There is a few restaurants and we got an enjoyable dinner at the one on the beach a few times but it was pretty espensive (12AUD for a main) compared to prices in Sanur and Ubud (3-6AUD for a main) Overall a nice expirience but probably would stay 3 or even 2 nights instead of 4 as its wonderful for relaxing but not for much else",
        "Even though I told them four times I would come to their BBQ they had no table available Others ran into the same problem yet I saw many tables unoccupied all evening",

        "I really liked the more Balinese styling and grounds of this hotel",
        "Did like the pool-bar though! Our family room was really big - the girls shared a bunk bed in a separate room to ours",
        "Must agree with another reviewer on staff at breakfast - except for the welcoming lady, the rest was ordinary and it sometimes took multiple attempts to get attention or service",
        "Not sure if this a ploy to get tourists out of their rooms and interacting with each other, but it was inconvenient at times",
        "This resort is advertised as 5 star but we found it lacking",
        "The Buffet breakfast was less than average - not much of a choice and half the hot food on offer was stone cold on most mornings - even though we were usually there at 7",
        "We would not stay there again",
        "We stayed in a Palace Club Room and Palace Club Suite (interconnecting) and what a great experience!

        "We stayed in a club room",

        "I stayed at this hotel for three nights in February 2013",
        "The room size was average even though because of high occupancy, we were upgraded to a premier room, it was small and noisy from the construction site close by",
        "After a million dollar renovation, I was expecting a swanky modern hotel, it was a let down",
        "Some of the restaurants in the area offer a free pick up & drop off service",
        "I stayed at the property for 4 nights in November 2012",
        "If I had known how much there was to do at, and around the hotel, I would have booked in for more than 4 days",
        "At first I was a little disappointed that the hotel was in a 'hotel compound' so rather removed from the typical Bali scene (night markets etc) but the free shuttle bus provided by 'Bali Collection' (the local shopping centre) was excellent and we used it daily",
        "As our check-out was several hours before our flight, we were welcome to use the spa to swim and shower prior to departured",
        "I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",
        "15 min walks and you can eat in Bali Collection or in the Street (I recomended Tropical Restaurant)",

        "we will come to this place everytime we plan for bali,",
        "It wasn't cheap and there were definitely be much cheaper options for a stay in Bali but it was safe and friendly",
        "The beach isn't that great in my opinion - no shade and not that nice, but I realise coming from Queensland we are spoilt with some of the best beaches in the world",
        "If we get a chance to go top Bali again any time soon, I would probably try Sanur as I would like to able to walk to nearby restaurants and have easier access to trips to ubud",
        "The entrance says it all",
        "It has a prime beachfront location and is quite large",
        "We were upgraded on check-in, the room was fantastic with great service throughout our stay",

        "It does rain more than Seminyak, but we didnt care",
        "We swam in the pool in the rain because it was still hot",
        "So much to do when it does anyway",
        "I had two amazing massages",
        "Recommend to get it included in your accommodation cost",
        "As advised by some reviewers we requested for a quiet room not facing the construction site nearby as it can get noisy",
        "Of course, when we went to this room, we realised it was facing the aformentioned construction site",
        "We asked for another room and they then gave us a replacement room which was not the one we booked for",
        "By this time, we were so tired and the kids were getting cranky so we just accepted the room",
        "After all our efforts to get a quiet room, we could still hear the construction site",
        "The building perhaps was a little bit old, but it was well maintained and clean",
        "Even when we were booking the hotel, it tooks us numeorous emails and phone calls to achieve that",
        "We requested an evening check out as we had a night flight, and, even after we specifically told reception in the morning, our key cards were blocked and we were locked out of our rooms on that afternoon",
        "Although the potential was there for a great hotel, it just didn't deliver in some areas",
        "We do not travel with kids and enjoyed the fact that we could enjoy somewhere quiet and very relaxing",

        "We had a 4 night stay in this resort in summer 2012",
        "Just got around to writing about it now, but the memories have stayed with me and will do so for some time I think",
        "It was almost completed when we stayed there last year, so perhaps should be completed by now",
        "LCD TV's with DVD players, good linen, nice firm but not stiff mattresses, soft pillows, new towels, and many other aspects which is plainly obvious to have been recently put in place all make for a good value and a pampering type of atmosphere for people staying there",
        "Nusa Dua is located about 15minutes drive from the main Kuta strip area where alot of the action tends to happen, but we were happy to be in a place where we could just hang around all day and be content",
        "With traffic these days in bali, it's useful not having to go into some of the other parts of the island",
        "whole family was in love with the resort and we did not want to leave",
        "actually inquired about extending the stay but our airline tickets would have charged a big penalty for the change, so we decided to forgo",

        "It is a bit of a con to get you to buy into a timeshare so dont fall for it!!",
        "Even though we were at the hotel during a very quite time, it was hard to get onto a computer",
        "There is Wi Fi in the room so next time I will take my computer instead",
        "All the $40 bottles were not available",

        "Staff and grounds were lovely but we will never stay again at the Nuca Dua hotel",
        "The ammentities were a bit of a let down being cheap generic shampoo and condtioner etc",
        "We ended up buying shampoo from a local shop",
        "The leaisure facilities were also excellent with several beautiful pools (although they closed very early 7 pm for water treatment which could be done later especially considering it was such a great time to go for a swim)",
        "Outside of the resort I found everyone to basically to be a liar and a con man",
        "We also went to Jimbaran Bay and was honestly quite horrified at the condition or restauarnts and general hygiene, we felt far from safe walking down the street, especailly with groups of men all sitting on the side of the road looking menacingly towards us, I hoenstly thought we were a moment from being robbed or worse, we couldn't get a cab quick enough to get back to the resort",

        "We did report to housekeeping and duty managers",
        "Buffet breakfast was very good as to be expected from Nusa Dua resorts, and room service was comparable to pricing within resort restaurants making it very convenient to dine in room",
        "Resort facilities including swimming pools, spa, tennis courts, bike hire, massage were all very good, but it was hard to look past the problems in the rooms hence we probably won't return here in the future",
        "I went with my best friend and decided on Nusa Dua beach because of the great recommendations",

        "I certainly only chose it for logistical reasons",
        "Still, I can't imagine staying here again",
        "It's basically a monster tourist factory, and the only connection to Balinese culture is that's it's physically located in Bali",
        "I can understand having international restaurants here, but not the abysmal quality or high price",
        "- $25 for airport transfer (just step outside the complex and a taxi will do it for $10);",
        "I suppose if you just want your kids to have a swim in the pool and to get some sun, then it's OK, but a Balinese experience it ain't, and as Western experiences go it was unpleasant",

        "It was just a nice gesture to let us in even we were 5 hours too early from the allowable check in time",
        "From checking in, requesting another room which was immediately granted (no fault of the hotel), the pool, the restaurants, the food, the rooms and room service, the beds, the setting, the quiet music at the pool / lounge / bar, the service - and not the least the smiles at all times - it was a great and very relaxing experience",

        "We couldn't have imagined a more perfect setting for our honeymoon",
        "I cant even imagine how much money it would cost these days to build such as a hotel as the details in the woodwork, carvings, floors etc",
        "IMO, prices should be at least 25% cheaper",
        "We had to stay in that room for one night",
        "The resort then moved us the following day and we received a two bed room with an ocean view",
        "the entrance lobby is overwhelming as it's open and lush and elegant",

        "Being a fan of Nusa Dua, I've been looking for the winner across the beach line",
        "Honestly, I never think Nusa Dua Beach would be my fave as I try it on 6th after Sheraton, Nikko, Novotel, Ayodya and Melia",

        "I read some good reviews on the pizza, so I thought I'd try it",
        "But when I got one it was very bad",
        "I would prefer Pizza Hut or Domino's",
        "It's so garlicky! And its more like a garlic cracker, its certainly NOT a bread",
        "Not sure why the other reviewers enjoyed it, probably I got unlucky?",
        "Go to Bali collection, The Bay or Kendi Kuning for cheaper lunch/dinner",

        "We had two dinners outside, in Nusa Dua city and those couldn't compare with the quality of the dinners we had in the hotel",
        "We ordered room service once - the nasi goreng was one of the best I've had in Bali - and ate at the traditional Indonesian restaurant another night",
        "As that was my birthday dinner, we dined at the special pavilion in the middle of the pool, with a dedicated waiter",
        "From a price-quality perspective, it is hard to beat this hotel",

        "No full length mirror which was very frustrating to see when I was dressing for a wedding",
        "It is Nusa so all the hotels/resorts are all within the Resort compounds",
        "We had a great time, arrived in time for a Balinese dance dinner, just walked in sat down and enjoyed the presentation",
        "It was fantastic",
        "We opted for the Palace Club for our stay, on arrival whisked away for a private check in",

        "We were there for our 10 day honeymoon and had a wonderful time from start to finish",
        "Staff were always ready to help and friendly and always had a smile on their face, there was never a time we didn't feel welcome",
        "We didn't give the spa 5 stars because, as a honeymoon couple, we would've preferred if we could've enjoyed the jacuzzi or sauna together rather than separately! But nevertheless, a great, clean and relaxing spa! Would definitely recommend for a honeymoon :)",
        "This is our fourth trip to Bali but the first time at this hotel and we loved it! From the pick up at the airport from the hotel which l would suggest as their is a lot of construction going on and negotiating the terminal can be tricky for newcomers, to the check in process at reception it all went like clockwork",
        "Not a big fan of the overhead shower and trying to close the shower door was interesting as there is no inside handle",
        "One pool was closed while we were there but we never had any trouble finding somewhere in the shade to sit",

        "All staff are friendly and helpful, rooms have everything we need and are clean",
        "This trip we got back to our room one day to find it double locked - we couldn't get in",
        "The Duty Manager explained that the person cleaning our room had found our safe unlocked and open - he walked back to the room with us to check all was well - it was",
        "Breakfast is included in the room rate and thank goodness there are scales in our bathroom otherwise we would have eaten more of the delicious food each day!!! We will certainly be returning here next year and hopefully the years after that",
        "I find it so tiring just walking to the swimming pool and the beach",
        "But don't complain as it was free",
        "It's real 5 stars here, but the entire Nusa Dua is so-so",
        "Loved it!",
        "We stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 4 nights to the end of May 2012",
        "As others have mentioned, the restaurants/drinks in hotel can be quite expensive (compared to those outside) but we found them very good and we appreciated the proximity to the pool and our room",
        "The hotel staff were also very friendly, greeting us wherever we went",
        "As we arrived pretty late in the evening on the first day, we decided to have dinner at the hotel itself",
        "Ordered their famous Crispy Duck set dinner and it was not a wrong choice made",
        "However, the price was quite expensive but I guess that was normal since we decided to dine in-house",
        "After the day trip, we also stopped by Kuta Beach to shop around and did foot massage",
        "And it took us almost 30 mins to take a cab back to the hotel",
        "We stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 4 nights mid May",
        "As others have mentioned, the restaurants/drinks in hotel can be quite expensive (compared to those outside) but we found them very good and we appreciated the proximity to the pool and our room",
        "Where do I start?? Well the resort is fantastically located and that is the only positive I can provide",
        "We opted to upgrade from the deluxe to the premier rooms and unfortunately we were far from impressed",
        "The doors leading to the pool area wouldn't lock, tv reception was so poor that it was unwatchable",
        "Of all the power points in the room, 1 worked",
        "Our 'double' bed was 2 single beds pushed together, which we promptly fell through during the night",
        "So apparently management feels as though it's acceptable for their customers to pay for these 'services'",
        "After I had paid for the entire bill, we were offered 50% off our next stay there!! How thoughtful! It was blatantly obvious that we would not be setting foot on the site ever again, so this was merely lip service",
        "Currently, as it stands, the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa provided none of the services for which I had paid and I can only see this as a breach of terms of contract",
        "If anyone would like any of the multiple photos or videos I have taken, feel free to get in contact",
        "Wayan Sariati and front office staff, I should conguratulate Mr",
        "I just got home after a 10 night stay here with my wife and two kids (aged 3 & 5)",
        "Overall the hotel was fantastic, everything was in order, everyone was really nice and friendly, the kids loved being there with us, and we all had a ball",
        "I can understand not rolling it out to rooms, but would have thought that they could put wifi access points in each bar - in today's world where we rely on internet connectivity, it is an easy thing for the hotel to improve",
        "Drinks were well priced throughout the hotel, and babysitters are available (something we didn't make use of enough)",
        "Next time I think we'll split our trip with some R&R in Nusa Dua, and a few days somewhere a little more convenient for when we want to get out and about",
        "Overall we were happy - I can be a grumpy traveller, and with the hotel being a large component of the cost of the holiday, I expect a lot",
        "This place did well to live up to my expectations, we'll definitely be back",
        "The beach is so clean and quite not to mention we could see the other island across the sea if we lay on the beach bed",
        "We also went to have some drink at their looks new Lobby Bar,excellent choices of cocktails and with the price we paid for that month promotion buy 1 get 1 we think it was quite acceptable",
        "Well the hotel had everything we need though so we just ended up staying most of the time inside,it has Bank and ATM,travel and tour agent,shops for clothing,lobby shop,few restaurants,spa pool,tennis,squash,jogging track even play ground for kids !! Amazing amazing hotel",
        "I had a ground-floor room opening out onto the pool area",
        "The air conditioning worked great, and I could get my room *really* cold at night if I wanted",
        "You can get several miles in within the Nusa Dua area without too much trouble, although it can be a bit tricky to follow it around a few places where it appears to end at fences or buildings",
        "The Westin actually does a guided run at 7:30 am so if you find your way there, that's a big help: they have a mapped-out 5K or 8K loop they will show you--then you can do it on your own earlier in the morning when it's cooler",
        "It is one of the most beautiful hotels in Nusa Dua,this was our second stay and again it was fantastic from rooms to staff and service",
        "Food and drinks were very good and not as expensive as we imagined",
        "Another small point is the annoying music being played by the guys at breakfast on the Metallophone (traditional Indonesian Instrument) I appreciate its traditional and I'm sure the the guys are very talented but do we need to listen to this at breakfast?",
        "We were most pleased with the every thing connected with the Hotel / Resort",
        "It was my 3rd time in Bali, and we absolutely enjoyed the time we have spent in this hotel",
        "We could all stay in the same suite with independent bedrooms, and a private pool!!",
        "This is one of the best stays I had in a 5* hotel",
        "We'd been to Bali before but wanted to stay somewhere quieter than Kuta/Legian so thought we would try Nusa Dua",
        "We got exactly what we wanted - a clean, quiet and relaxing place, right on the beach",
        "We also ate quite a few meals at the hotel as there aren't alot of other dining options around, apart from at the neighbouring hotels on the beach or at Bali Collection",
        "I was very happy with my decision to stay here",
        "I also looked at the Melia hotel, which is about 3 hotels down on the same beach strip but was glad we didn't stay there - it had more of a big hotel vibe - loud music, large tour groups, pushy staff and watered down cocktails (we went there for happy hour one day)",
        "We have stayed here 5 times and it just keeps getting better and better",
        "We were upgraded to a palace room this time and were made to feel like royalty",
        "I can't recommend it highly enough",
        "It's our home away from home xx",
        "I already stayed in several 5-star holiday resorts in Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey etc",
        "- rooms service and cleaning is simply amazing, first bathroom I see since ages which is clean clean (and I am very picky)",
        "- staff is very friendly at all times - if there is a question or problem it will be easily fixed within 5 minutes",
        "- complimentary water (2 bottles) get filled up every day, I had the impression even two times",
        "- the beach os good for kids as well, as it has not that much waves (which I did not like personally because of the sea grass)",
        "And taxis are cheap so it's not much of a problem",
        "It is a large complex and was not very busy at this time",
        "Would come back perhaps if we got same sharp rate next time",
        "Me and my wife had a great time in this hotel",
        "Just what we need",
        "There was a glitch which I was had a chat time with my wife in the balcony around 11",
        "I was experienced it on my last day stay in the hotel",
        "Overall, I (we) love it!! Definitely will go back again in our top list hotel in Bali",
        "The wedding was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen so if anyone is considering it for that then i would recommend it",
        "There are a few restaurants and the ones I ate at were delicious (who would of thought I travel all the way to Bali and end up getting one of the tastiest pizzas around)",
        "Even room service was good, I could eat those fries all day long!",
        "You get complimentary use of the steam room, jacuzzi, sauna and lap pool which we made full use of",
        "Both times we went into the jacuzzi we were the only ones there and at the lap pool there were 2 other people in lounges in the shade and we were the only ones in the water",
        "It's a bit away from the rooms but quiet, relaxing and a nice change from the main pools",
        "When we wanted to go back to Seminyak (20 - 25 minutes away) the staff were efficient in getting us a transfer and organizing payment",
        "Overall this is a great hotel in the relaxing Nusa Dua area and the only bad thing about it is a tiny lizard came into our room at some point but it disappeared soon after",
        "made the mistake of trying a villa for part of a holiday but we ended up back at the Nusa Dua beach hotel!",
        "I complained about aircon one night and was automatically offered a room change or upgrade",
        "I will rate this hotel compared to the other three hotels in the vicinity",
        "The aircon works perfectly",
        "The food at the resort is great and the breakfasts are probably the best i have had in Bali",
        "My husband and I always make sure that we go back here each time we visit Bali for Lunch or Dinner",
        "We also had a spa treament and massage included in our wedding package and it was amazing",
        "Wife got sick during trip, cannot imagine more care what she received from Palace club staff, luckly with doctor's help she get weel within few days and we could spend lovely Easter and also have nice dinner at Raja's, quality and friendliness was again to top, but please change menu sometime, it would be pleasure for use how visit often",
        "Hotel cleaning staff cannot be better, polite also laundry service worked very well and for us it was also reasonable price",
        "Actually durning palace club cocktails other visitors told us same, good service but hurry afterwods and have to fill comment card",
        "DVD player has different system than last time, our DVD's from Europe didnt work, wrong zone, that wasnt nice, but now when we need to spend more time at room in evenings (wine problem) it was good that there is few movie channels (free), it was nice",
        "Except for an afternoon/evening in Legian and Kuta we spent the entire time relaxing by the pool or at the private beach",
        "Bintang 54,000 rph at resort and 17,000 at Circle K",
        "Despite the recent travel advisories, we never had any concerns about our safety at any time during our stay",
        "We went for our honeymoon in feb 2011 and stayed here for 3 nights",
        "A must go place!!!",
        "so tranquil",
        "Did a lot of research on tripadvisor, and we were so happy with our choice",
        "and it was very nice",
        "Oh, and ya, we were upgraded to a pool facing room which was super",
        "As Nusa Dua holds international summits and conferences, it feels very \"western\" as a place",
        "We stayed at the resort in April with our 20 month old son",
        "The rooms was nice, comfortable and clean but not as nice as I had expected for a five star resort",
        "The food and drinks were really expensive and it was hard to get out of the hotel",
        "We were not overly impressed by the quality of the food and a soft drink or a water was almost $5AUD with tax and service",
        "We walked down to the markets at the entrance to Nusa Dua and dropped our laundry at the \"Oriental Day Spa\"",
        "Right from the well organized pick up at the very busy airport in Bali, I knew that this hotel was going to be special - it was only very disappointing not to have shared my experiences with my wife!",
        "and it was always a pleasure to return to the peaceful surroundings",
        "In conclusion this hotel has all the necessary components to provide a peaceful and tranquil escape from the everyday stresses and strains we all endure!",
        "we have been to bali 9 times now & stayed at most of the hotels a long that strip & this has to be 1 of the best we will be going back in march for our 1st anniversary thats how good it was",
        "I DONT RECOMMEND THIS ISLAND OR COUNTRY AT ALL",
        "I'm surprised to read the other positive reviews on this site and others",
        "However, the rooms are a little smaller than at other similar resorts I've stayed at and could do with some updating, especially the big scratches in the floor from the bed",
        "For this reason I cannot recommend this hotel at all",
        "I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights",
        "The rooms are already renovated, so it's a mixture between modern and traditional",
        "At the first night, I stayed at the deluxe room",
        "it's a nice and clean room, but I found the A/C not as cold as I want it to be, so I reported it and the technician came",
        "Actually the A/C were working, but not that cold in the daytime, at night I still can slept well",
        "I could not have been happier with this resort",
        "I knew that Nusa Dua was a gated 5* complex and so I wasn't expecting to see much if the 'real' Bali but having stayed in kuta before I was happy with this",
        "There was so much to do",
        "I stayed at this hotel in September 2011",
        "It is a beautiful hotel",
        "It is a lap pool with champak trees",

        "We went twice in 3 days",
        "The price of alcohol at the hotel is expensive - but sitting in the pool at the swim up bar, I felt obliged to savour a local beer - waiter service excellent ! We would definitely return",
        "After much research, courtesy of Tripadvisor, we decided on the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for our 8 night Bali getaway",
        "We wanted somewhere quiet, away from the hustle & bustle of the Kuta/Legian strip",

        "We were ushered to the Club lounge and checked in there whilst enjoying complimentary coctails",
        "We had breakfast on the Club lounge occassionally and experienced a very attentive service from all staff and freshly cooked to order breakfast",
        "Hopefully it won't become an over priced tourist trap but as it stands it's still a beautiful Island with Beautiful friendly people",
        "Can't wait to go back",
        "On arrival I was greeted with a welcome drink and cool towel, extremely efficient check in and shown to my room",
        "Wifi is free in the lobby area but charged in the rooms (I just don't get this) and the bar next to the lobby has a great afternoon tea and happy hour, it is very chic and modern",
        "do try it",
        "I only stayed for 2 nights as I prefer to be amongst things",
        "but if you want a chilled break with good service and everything in the complex (including shops, bank, hairderesser etc) I would recommend it",
        "As such, we would prefer to stay somewhere safe and after reading reviews at tripadvisor, we chose Nusa Dua Beach hotel and Spa located along the beautiful nusa dua beach",
        "We were very surprised at the security of the hotel",
        "When we first step foot into the resort, we felt as if we had been transported to another world",
        "Checking in was a breeze and we were even escorted to our room by the front office staff",
        "Walking further, we realised that the resort is even bigger than what we initailly thought",
        "Overall, this resort is one of the best, if not the best that i had ever stayed",
        "We arrived Denpasar Mon 13 Feb after a 6 hr Virgin flight from Brisbane",
        "We would come here again, but not to Kuta",
        "We enjoyed the comforts of the Palace Club where we checked-in and were given an upgrade to a honeymoon suite",
        "Also, they remember how you like things and in offering, do so in that manner (eg would you like your soy latte with sweetener today)",
        "We had booked a Palace Club Room with use of the Palace Club, but were upgraded to a Palace Club Suite on Level 4 overlooking private garden area",
        "Evening cocktails was very good but a bit of trap as after a few canapes we generally didn't go and have a meal",
        "We would definately go back to this hotel",
        "It was a case of find everything yourself",
        "I did enjoy syating at this hotel however I do think the hotel can improve on customer service when it comes to basics",
        "I visited the hotel for a week of R&R with my husband",
        "It is probably the best place in Nusa Dua for that kind of vacation",
        "The disappointment was the staff, hence why I would not rate the hotel 5-star",
        "Specify that you want a taxi-metre and the bill drops to USD 1",
        "(2) Cheap staff and it shows",
        "It was wonderful in 1991, it is excellent now, 2012",
        "It has recently gone through a renovation and brought up to modern standards",
        "We stayed in a premier room only because of the quiet location",
        "If you want to splurge get a Palace room on the third floor- room is bigger, but to tell the truth we only saw the room at night",
        "We ate at the Chess restaurant, right on the beach, with excellent service",
        "I had the steak and it was delicious",
        "Having stayed in the Palace Club at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel on many occasions and always loving it, I was slightly disappointed this time around",
        "As always, we spent 3 days in Nusa Dua after a few days in Seminyak",
        "After a very warm reception at the Palace Club, I was shown to my room; yes the rooms have been refurnished, but fortunately have kept the Balinese feel that I like",
        "I'm not fond of this system as choice is limited, and I feel that the food was far less enjoyable than it had been on previous occasions, and quality nowhere near as good",
        "Over a ten year period I have stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel on a number of occasions and always find it a great place to relax and just \"chill out\"",
        "This time I took a massage session at the Spa - very professional, very relaxing, and excellent surroundings",
        "At night it is an easy walk to eat or drink at one of the other 4 - 5 star hotels nearby",
        "We only had 2 days to go on our Bali holiday and after a week at another 5 star resort we decided to relocate finish our holiday at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa",
        "I phoned at 9am, was welcomed warmly as a returning quest and checked in at the Palace Wing by 10",
        "I am so glad we did",
        "There is no need to leave the resort with all its resturants, but we did visit the local Bali Collection shopping centre for a look around and buy souveniers for the grandchildren",
        "It is an open air walk from shop to shop",
        "Also why would they charge money for internett usage in the room when its the slowest connection I have ever experianced in a hotel? All in all, i would recommend it",
        "Even if you miss the bus, a taxi is so cheap as it is only a 10 min walk and a 5 minute drive or thereabouts",
        "We loved it here and would definately stay again",
        "It is a big hotel so walking is required",
        "The pool/bar dining area is in a wonderfull setting right off the beach, making it a special time and place for lunch",
        "The Mee Goring there is incredible, I had it twice",
        "We went to Bali Collection (a shopping center in the area with restuarants) for dinner most nights and there if the food was dissapointing at least we did not overpay",
        "Beds were very hard it took one day of little sleep to get used to them",
        "Rooms were large and A/C in January was adequate",
        "The spa was great and we went everyday to their pool, hot tub and sauna",
        "The hotel is a bit far from things so it is not really convenient to other things except for the beach walking trail",
        "We toured two days while we were there",
        "Still the hotel arranged driver is very reasonable by international standards and a safer choice, but we like the adventure of finding our own way at times",
        "We would stay there again for 3-4 days of beach time",
        "For a 6 night stay, it was very mediocre",
        "I agree with Sndra 88, it needed updating, but there were some parts of the resort that were under construction, so hopefully it will help",
        "We experienced excellent service throughout Indonesia",
        "Spa was nice, I'd give it a three star rating",
        "I was told by a local that if you want spa treatments, it is better to go off site",
        "We loved the traditional Balinese style of the hotel, very different to the modern resorts in the Nusa Dua area and exactly the right place to stay for a proper Bali experience",
        "We both would definitely stay here again!",
        "We were disappointed with how dated and worn the room looked when we were escorted to it",
        "We immediately asked if we could upgrade to a nicer room, and did not mind paying the difference",
        "I would not bother returning to this hotel again",
        "Just completed only a short 2 night stay at NDBH",
        "The staff at the property are by far the friendliest- most helpful group I have encountered at any hotel worldwide",
        "The little touches throughout our stay is what will have me return time over",
        "The overall design of the hotel is not only incredibly clever- its something special that I will remember for a lomg time to come",
        "I had researched it closely here on TA and was delighted with the choice",
        "Having booked a whole extra day because we had a late night flight, we were told on arrival we would only need to pay for half a day as it was just a late check out",
        "Anyway, it didnt spoil the experience for us, but its something for the hotel to fix",
        "We stayed at the NDBH after 6 nights in Legian",
        "We booked a palace club room for ourselves and deluxe rooms for our sons",
        "We had breakfast in both the club lounge and the restaurant and unfortunately was the same every day so it did get a bit boring after a few days",
        "The pools are lovely but we did have problems getting lounges",
        "I went for a walk one morning at 6",
        "Grass around the pool and down to the beach was incredible, it was so soft - like walking on carpet",
        "We stayed at Nusa dua beach hotel in October 2011 and can't rave enough about it",
        "I researched the various hotels on trip advisor and selected Nusa Dua Beach Hotel as the best place for our getaway",
        "On the site it seemed perfectly located as it was not too far away from the main shopping town of Kuta but enough of a distant so that we were away from the hustle and bustle of it all",
        "I did not go wrong by choosing this hotel! It was everything and more!! We were thrilled when we got there as the hotel was all ready to welcome us",
        "Night walks on the path are encouraged as there are always security patroling",
        "I stayed two nights around Christmas day, and enjoyed it very much",
        "Luckily I stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, it was only 3 minutes walk, ClubMed is located next to Nusa2Beach",
        "Me and my wife would like to thank Nusa dua beach hotel for a pleasant stay",
        "- coctails and fresh juices (and in-house dining generally as well) were very nice but somewhat pricey (around 12$ for a pina colada)",
        "Note however that overall we had a very pleasant stay",
        "Can't say enough about this place",
        "When we arrived there was a bit of a mix-up regarding our reservation (two adjoining rooms) - Suasana stepped in and did a fantastic job of resolving the situation; we couldn't have been happier with what he did for us",
        "Consequently - we are going back again for March break",
        "The cocktails and other drinks are delicious however and we also enjoyed the breakfasts in that area",
        "The practice of guests 'reserving' poolside loungers for the day by popping down in the morning and leaving numerous towels needs to be addressed, as does the noise that others made at all hours of the night, but I understand that can be difficult for staff",
        "We were below such noisy people for a couple of nights, but when brought to the attention of staff, we were upgraded and able to move to a very quiet room for the rest of our stay",
        "The hotel was decorated beautifully for the festive season, the hotel went out of its way, serving Christmas cookies and chocolates in the room, champagne with breakfast on New Years Day and presenting us with a beautiful hotel calender when we left",
        "I have some very happy memories of my stay at Nusa Dua beach hotel",
        "2) if you are staying in a deluxe room with garden view, the terrace seems a little exposed and if it rains (which it does a lot in Bali during this season) there is no protection for you to sit out and watch a good rain (which we love to do)",
        "I would definitely stay again, though I would upgrade to the Palace club suites",
        "We had booked for 4 nights at NDBH coming from Legian",
        "Our check in was smooth and foyer lovely but as soon as we started walking toward our room down the corridor I started to worry, feeling hemmed in",
        "We had a deluxe room for 4 and it looked ok when we went in, a bit dark but nice furniture and perfect for our needs",
        "The pool and beach areas are nice, there were some major yobbos around the pool, jumping off the pool bar so that spoilt the serenity",
        "We walked to Bali Collections for dinner and had a nice meal, we couldn't believe the prices of massages here!",
        "It wasn't but the President suite above ours was",
        "We checked out and headed back to KP where we had a huge suite overlooking the pool with great restaurants/massages/shopping at our fingertips, for the same price as NDBH!",
        "We stayed here for 4 night on Mar 2011",
        "At the same time if you are a sight seeing person and use it for just sleeping and occasionally using the facilities like I did I wouldn't recommend",
        "(Neither of these companies are associated with Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, I should point out)",
        "So, we were really hoping for the luxury and quiet space we should have had all week - and we were rewarded very well! On arrival, the staff were very welcoming and completely prepared for our arrival",
        "I was a little disappointed in the distance we had to walk from reception to our room, but it was OK once we'd done it a few times and the view and location were worth it - we were right at the pools and restaurants, so that was great",
        "I was very glad I upgraded to a Premier Room for not much greater cost, as it was probably quite a bit bigger and with better outlook than the regular rooms",
        "We would have appreciated more complimentary bottled water each day, as it is necessary to consume a great deal to rehydrate",
        "We enjoyed a meal at the pizza restaurant for lunch - yum - and with great service, too",
        "It also looks a bit tired and needs renovating",
        "Following day we enjoyed the \"Nusa Dua Explosion\" from the pool bar",
        "It was served in a pineapple - loads of fun",
        "00am, we were able to leave our bags with the concierge and make use of the hotel pool and other facilities until we needed to leave",
        "It was great and when we had been out for part of the evening, returning hot and tired, we grabbed our small bag from the concierge and made use of the Santi Lounge, the wonderful \"departure lounge\" downstairs from reception",
        "We had a refreshing shower with fresh towels and all amenities we needed, then relaxed in comfort on sofas in the air-conditioned large room watching tv and had a coffee before returning to reception to order our taxi for the airport",
        "It was with sadness we said goodbye to this wonderful hotel - smiling and helpful staff, everything spotlessly clean, true Balinese decoration (oh my, the carving on handrails and the lights in the main foyer were truly amazing!!) and wonderful Balinese hospitality",
        "I do hope we have the opportunity to return - I wouldn't even check out another hotel, but just book straight away for this one",
        "At night it is a wonderful setting as is the beach restaurant",
        "I've seen many people on Tripadvisor moaning about the prices of the eateries but hey, your staying in a 5 Star complex so it's not that bad",
        "I would definitely recommend this hotel to every one, stunning !!!",
        "However, I experience smelly toilet, I change rooms, and have same problem",
        "We stayed from Dec 9 to 12, and the place was virtually empty, which was fabulous for us as we dislike crowds",
        "The hotel service was outstanding from the minute we were collected from the hotel - very friendly and welcoming",
        "We had the BBQ at the Asian restaurant one night, lunch at the chess bar another day, and breakfast each morning",
        "The breakfast choices were good, however, if you want extras such as cappucino/latte or poached eggs - be prepared to wait and/or follow up you order as it may not come at all",
        "We loved the pool area - swim up bar, views of beach",
        "After some search we chose the Nusa Dua beach resort",
        "Check in process done so fast & take us to our room",
        "But after few day I just find back yard area, it was beautiful quit & more luxury",
        "We spend 2 week at the Bali & see all the beaches & area",
        "At the pool area I intrude to scuba diving booths and start to learn diving & get the PADI open weather license",
        "I strongly suggest you to rent the car (with driver) for full day Bali tour, to take you around like rice trace & lack at volcano",
        "The nusa doa is the best place, but if you look for some night intersegments & more restaurant you should visit kuta, we rent motor bike & visit the kuta every night",
        "Highly recommend take the pre paid dinner option through the travel agt as it turned out to be excellent value",
        "I will make this short",
        "It reminded me of a typical all inclusive but wasnt",
        "The staff are nice, room was great ( they upgraded me even though i had already paid a great price)",
        "We have stayed at this hotel every year for the last 10x years and its absolutely excellent",
        "Every time we visit we stay in the Palace Club",
        "Lovely staff, whom we have gotten to know better each year we visit",
        "We recommend the strawberry and banana pancakes with a mixed juice on the side",
        "It really is a gorgeous resort",
        "Last month I went to this hotel with my family of 2 kids and my older parents for 2 nights",
        "Unlike the bad experience I had on Kuta beach",
        "The cleaners check on us twice a day to ensure we do not need anything",
        "We asked for a babycrib from the hotel since we were also bringing our 9 months old son",
        "We put our son in the crib and locked it properly",
        "We then take our time to pack up our things to get ready for checkout",
        "We were bringing a baby, so you can imagine how much stuff we had in the room",
        "Meanwhile our son got bored locked up in a crib and decided to protest by grabbing the crib door railings and start shaking it",
        "We were planning to complain to the staff, but since we were in a hurry due to very tight schedule with our return planes, we were practically running to catch the plane in the airport and totally forgot about it",
        "Don't get me wrong",
        "And I'm sure if I had the chance to properly complain to the staff, they would have been able to accomodate it very properly",
        "I'd encourage you to spend time here, since it will be worth it for a quite vacation or even with your whole family",
        "we were then asked for a cash donation before we could leave the island ! So in summary the hotel is beautiful, the food is tasty and well presented if somewhat expensive and you have every facility available to cater for your needs,just be aware of the beach hawkers !",
        "However, if you walk just outside the hotel there are a number of restaurants that are much cheaper and we found the food to be of a very high quality",
        "I would highly recommend this hotel!",
        "Aside from that, it was a great place to stay with a decent kids club, pool bar and babysitting available",
        "We would stay there again but Nusa Dua itself is probably too quiet for us (although it definitely suited our R&R needs on this holiday)",
        "When we stay at the palace club we feel so special because of the excellent service by the wonderful staff",
        "Altough Nusa Dua is relatively far from shopping center area (Kuta, Legian), I really enjoy my business trip by staying in this hotel",
        "Would love to go again!!",
        "Nusa Dua Beach Hotel had some of the nicest grounds of any hotel I have seen",
        "We had the most amazing time during our two week stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, we got married while we were there",
        "It was completely magical from the stunning beach, beautiful grounds (gardens, ponds, sculptures), wonderful spa, fabulous restauarants - especially the Asian Bistro - and warm and friendly staff",
        "I would definitely recommend this hotel!",
        "We spent just under a week at this amazing hotel during our honeymoon",
        "We truly appreciated the careful attention we were given",
        "We loved our time here and can thoroughly recommend this hotel wholeheartedly",
        "We had to pay to hire DVD player & internet access",
        "The spa was very expensive too, so we ended up catching a 3min taxi ride to local shops for our spa treatments",
        "I would not recommend this hotel to younger people (25-30yrs)",
        "The hotel is overall of very good standards, nice rooms, nice service, could not find any reason not to enjoy the holidays, I was expecting to find very good spas in Bali but this was way much better than what I expected !!",
        "I could meet the young french Spa Manageress Aurore just to congratulate her for the quality and attentions to details",
        "definitely to recommend !!",
        "Walking is fine, but it is hot and humid",
        "I loved the variety at bfast, suited to many cultures",
        "We had everything we could possibly have wanted and so much more",
        "The rooms are serviced twice daily and we were never lacking or wanting for anything (Thank you for the complimentary water daily)",
        "We dined on a number of occasions at the hotel",
        "We also enjoyed snacks by the pool and daily drinks at the swim up pool bar",
        "The absence of a menu board may deter people from dining due to a perception that it is exclusive and expensive",
        "We could not have dealt with our crisis as well as we did had it not been for Peter and the Palace Club Team",
        "Having stayed in Sanur, Kuta South and Legian on previous visits, we very much appreciated the tranquil environment offered in Nusa Dua",
        "We are currently planning our return visit to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for 2012",
        "Overall, I was impressed with the property, the standard of food overall and the smiling, professional staff",
        "You get personal butler and those people do whatever they can to make it comfortable for you",
        "I will be back thats for sure and i wont forget how the staff helped me when i had problems there",
        "I had the pleasure to stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for some days in September",
        "My rooms was obvious not been used for a long time so it need some freshen up, but after a day it was clean and fit for use",
        "We recently stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for our honeymoon in Bali",
        "We arrived to a complimentary drink and rose petals strewn on our bed",
        "It was such a relief after the hectic drive from the airport in Denpasar",
        "I could sit there forever",
        "This was probably the best hotel breakfast I have ever had",
        "The hotel is situated fairly close to Bali Collection so that if you need any souvenirs or just want to grab some dinner, it's convenient",
        "it was such a great stay in the newly renovated hotel",
        "We loved the hotel though knew it was going to be more expensive than anywhere else in Bali, we were on our \"babymoon\" so didnt really mind",
        "It was peaceful and relaxing- just what we wanted",
        "The included breakfast was awesome, and catered for me being vegetarian and pregnant",
        "We did find the bed very hard but it wasnt a big deal",
        "Overall, as long as you are going for romance and/or relaxation, i recommend Nusa Dua Beach Resort",
        "We enjoyed hiring the bicycles out, and we see so much more of the area by doing so",
        "We would definantly choose this hotel again",
        "We had a beautiful 5 night stay here in Oct",
        "Also the spa is lovely and we appreciated not having to share the spa pool with children",
        "I was covered up in a one piece and cotton top, and old enough to be his mother, so I am not sure why he behaved so inappropriately but it was very out of line",
        "So I paid for 30 min and was back in after 15, and enjoyed none of it",
        "I do not recommend attending this excursion alone for women",
        "I did report this to guest services and also on a review requested from the hotel but have not had any response",
        "We travelled with 3 children aged 1 - 5, and the hotel was perfect for what we needed",
        "We stayed at Nusa Dua Beach hotel for 4 nights at the end of a two week Bali holiday, and had connecting rooms",
        "We booked the Deluxe rooms which were big enough and had a balcony overlooking the pool, beach and gardens, but we asked to move to ground floor rooms with garden access so it was easier to get to the pool",
        "The staff couldn't have been more helpful, and we ended up having two nights in each",
        "I agree that these prices are more expensive than you find outside the hotel, they are very cheap comapred to some other hotels we have stayed at in Nusa Dua",
        "We have just returned from one week staying at The Palace Rooms, located on the ground floor",
        "We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach hotel and spa for 5 nights as part of our honeymoon to Bali",
        "All in all, it was a great experience",
        "Ie- at the other hotels we stayed at as part of our honeymoon, we would receive a gift or room upgrade but here we had our towels made into a swan on our bed which we have had before when on a 'normal' holiday",
        "However, we should have looked into the Nusa Dua area a bit more before booking, it was quite bland and I think if we were to go back again we would choose the Seminyak area to stay in as it had great restaurants and atmosphere",
        "every morning i was excited for their buffet breakfast n just simply loved the realaxation it offered to a honeymoon couple like us",
        "I have travelled extensively around South East Asia a few years ago",
        "I have stayed in a variety of accommodations and types when on holidays",
        "I visited the Nusa Dua Beach Resort with my wife as part of a 3 week holiday to Bali, Lombok and Hong Kong",
        "Hotel Service (10 out of 10)",
        "The pool is lovely, I am not a great pool person anyway",
        "Food (8 out of 10)",
        "However, compared to local restaurants it is very expensive in the hotel, about 30% more",
        "Location (7 out of 10)",
        "- I tried to organise a full day tour from the hotel tour service",
        "My wife and I have just returned form our honeymoon to this hotel and i do not have a bad word to say about it! From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were made to feel welcome (as you are with most places in Bali) and the holiday went from strength to strength",
        "We had planned on doing a lot of trips while we were there but after waking up in this hotel we only managed about two trips! The hotel is stunning and the gardens add to this",
        "We will definately be returning here but the flight times from Scotland are something to consider (we stopped off in KL for four days on the way out)",
        "We stayed at this hotel in nov 10, we had interconnecting rooms",
        "When we arrived our bathroom smelt like vomit",
        "we should have complained but we just sprayed it with perfume",

        "We had a view of the pool, ocean and gardens, so felt we had it all",
        "It was our friend's 40th wedding anniversary while we were there and when I arranged a meal on the beach to celebrate, the customer relations staff arranged for their room to be decorated with flowers, fruit and a card at no cost",
        "I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone",
        "But u're in a tourist enclave and have no contact with the local culture beyond the hotel staff",
        "A good idea if u want to ease into the indonesian experience but know that u're an expensive cab ride from most activities",
        "I stayed here after getting married at St",
        "The later is more like a 7 star Hotel, so when I got to Nusa Dua Beach Resort I was almost upset",
        "Which I think would put this hotel near the top, but perhaps second tier",
        "It was perfect for us",
        "A nice balcony opening to the gardens which was perfect for the children to run and play while we watched",
        "Personalised and fast check in, lovely peaceful club area for having breakfast where the staff called all of us by name (including the children), even holding the baby while we ate! The afternoon tea was brilliant, the cocktail hour was outstanding (comp drinks and big hors d'oevres for two hours?!), free juices and soft drinks all day, free internet access",
        "The hotel was far cheaper than the Westin and many of the others, and i think actually presents very good value for money",
        "Didn't try anything else - we preferred driving into Seminyak",
        "However, if you wanted to hang around primarly in your hotel (and eat there or in other hotels in the area) it would suit you down to the ground",
        "We tried the kids club twice and were disappointed",
        "There was a pasta on the menu and one steamed chicken dish which were good, but we had to beg them not to add chips to every dish! Smaller, healthier meals would have been appreciated",
        "Luckily you could avoid them mostly, but its not what I expected from this type of hotel (and probably not something they can always avoid I guess - although maybe not serving Bintang in the pool until lunchtime?!)",
        "Overall, despite the niggles mentioned, we were delighted with the hotel",
        "The staff were exceptional, the room lovely and we felt it was very good value for money",
        "Figure it's time to give it a try beside my favorite melia",
        "This year alone i've been to nusa dua for 4 times",
        "To my surprise, i was given the newly renovated room, and boy it look nice!!! I'll just skip the standards and go to the points where the hotel stands out",
        "Has kids menu so i I don't have to order adult portion for my kids",
        "The pool is really warm, lucky my little 5 years old mad scientist brought thermometer, so we got some readings on Sept",
        "5th, 7pm, the sea temp 27",
        "Personally, i treasure the warm greetings from Pak Anom and Pak Raka",
        "It has sleepy and tired atmosphere, not romantic and jolly",
        "Need lots of candles to make it romantic",
        "And flowers here and there as well",
        "Given that size, It could turn into something practical and lively",
        "We have stayed in various hotels on the Kuta side",
        "We discovered the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa in 2009",
        "This is the best hotel I have stayed at in the world",
        "We have no experience of the Palace club, but if it is better than the regular hotel, wow",
        "I stayed in Augist with my wife and our 3 children",
        "We booked the family room, it can accomodate 2 adult, two young boys in a huge bunk bed and also a toddler",
        "We stayed in Nusa Dua during the day and then had a babysitting service (provided by an expert lady that made us confident) in order to spend some eventings in Seminyak",
        "In this way we had a more various vacation experiencing also the hustle and bustle of the chic restaurant of that area",
        "I would thoughly recommend this resort, its great value for money, no hawkers to bother you, and the best service I've ever had",
        "We visit many 4 - 5 star hotels in Bali in various places and have stayed in most hotels in Nusa Dua",
        "In their reviews other guests often report that Nusa Dua is lacking Balinese vibe, but we strongly disagree with them",
        "As we had such fond memories of our holiday we would like to take the opportunity to express our gratitude to everyone in Nusa Dua beach Hotel for such professional & efficient services on every level",
        "At the same time to all Balinese working in different places for making us feel so special",
        "We chose the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel after A LOT of research on Tripadvisor and feedback on other sites",
        "It was our honeymoon and we were looking for somewhere which would make us a feel a little special",
        "On the whole, we really enjoyed our time there and, were we to revisit Bali, would consider going back",
        "Walking it would only take 10-15 minutes",
        "Now the areas where we were disappointed:",
        "- As honeymooners I expected at least a tiny bit of fuss to be made of us - something to make us feel a little special",
        "I realise we are not the only people on honeymoon, but come on",
        "- The price of food and drink in the hotel needs a serious review - it is laughably expensive",
        "It is at least 3 times as expensive of that in the local shopping district",
        "If it was not for the Excellent service provided by the Spa team I would have changed hotels",
        "It's old and stale, dreary decor! Breakfast was ordinary, lunch at chess bar was a little better",
        "Unfortunately there were a few things that I found very disappointing in this hotel",
        "We probably would have spent a lot more there if the prices were not so prohibitive, instead we left the hotel to eat and drink",
        "It had quite dated TV and general fittings compared to the newer rooms on the 1000's side, we were on the 4000's side",
        "the food is nice it is in nusa dua area therefore it is secured and clean",
        "We stayed in a Palace Club Suite for 10 nights and enjoyed our time at the hotel",
        "We went and looked at the main buffet breakfast venue on one morning but looked fairly average and we quickly retreated back to the club lounge",
        "Other resaurants on site were ok, nothing special but adequate",
        "We had a lovely week at this hotel",
        "The only other negatives are the bar prices, very expensive for nothing special, it was quiet with no music",
        "On the whole we enjoyed our week here and would recommend it to friends, will hopefully return again",
        "We arrived back yesterday morning after the usual \"great\" overnight flight on Virgin, never again!! The Hotel is a haven from the touts on the beach and all the traffic that now chokes Bali in general",
        "Because it was ground floor we had room to sit around with 2 couples and have a drink at the end of the day on the balcony",
        "However, the drain in the shower kept overflowing into the toliet area of the bathroom and after asking to have it cleared twice it had not been fixed",
        "Asian food through to dohnuts and local fruits",
        "The night we dined, unfortunatley the wind was blowing a gale and we had trouble keeping our bread rolls on the table",
        "00 per head expensive for Bali but we ate 3 courses and enjoyed the whole experience",
        "We hired the hotel cars for the transfers to and from the airport",
        "However, if I was to saty in Bali again I would stay at this resort",
        "Just can't fault it",
        "I also did the garden tour and loved hearing about all the wild life, plants etc",
        "I am normally really fussy about accommodation (particularly cleanliness) but loved this; maybe a bit olde worlde Balinese'e in some rooms but I like this",
        "and say Hello to Arini for us",
        "We personally visited the top 10 resotrs in Nusa Dua and constantly came up with N D Beach ans being the best for various different reasons, eg, cost us $20",
        "Go for Nusa Dua Beach, we will forever more",
        "I would like to thank Peter Scholz (resident manager) and the staff for a most enjoyable stay in Nusa Dua",
        "We all also enjoyed the themed evenings/buffets in the theatre",
        "We travelled around quite a bit and took in lots of Bali - we particularly liked Ubud where we went white water rafting and stayed in a fabulous hotel (reviewed separately)",
        "If we had any small complaint of the Nusa Dua it would be no free wi-fi (expected in most 5* hotels) and charge for cycle hire",
        "We enjoyed taking the bikes out as a family but could be quite costly if out for long or often! All in all a really great holiday and we would love to come back maybe next time for a special birthday and bring the rest of our family! Thank you everyone for a super holiday",
        "We had a great stay in this hotel, it is one of the few authentic hotels in balinese style, but completely renovated",
        "They have also a beautiful spa were we had a great massage",
        "We definitely will come back to this hotel!",
        "Food was good but wih the 21% tax ended up being expensive as were the drinks",
        "There were some equally good places to eat at half the price on the road leading into Nusa Dua - only a short well lit walk away",
        "Fantastic day out and well worth the $65 pp",
        "We had the most amazing holiday with our two kids 3 years and 6 months",
        "We will be back here very soon",
        "We moved to the Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa after a terrible experience at the Aston Bali",
        "After our bad experience at the Aston Bali we decided to take a Palace Club room and upon arrival we were upgraded to a Palace Club Suite",
        "We had special check-in and check-out",
        "It was a High Tea experience and absolutely lovely",
        "In the early evening/late afternoon we had a two hours of cocktails and canapes",
        "We had access to free internet in the Palace Club and upon late check-out we were told that we could stay for High Tea",
        "It even has its own lap pool with lounge chairs",
        "This was our first trip back to Bali in about 10 years and we are checking our diaries on how soon we can get back to the Nusa Dua Beach Resort & Spa",
        "We will definately stay in this hotel again soon!",
        "My fiance and I booked our room through the Agoda website, which was seamless and very easy to do, it took us a while to choose our hotel and we chose this one",
        "Upon arriving at Denpasar Airport we were picked up by two friendly staff members from the hotel",
        "The bathroom however was fine with a roomy bath and a decent shower to match we had no complaints about the bathroom",
        "Breakfast was very nice, I personally am not one for the local cuisine however there were quite a few international options with a lot of fruit, pastries and pancakes/waffles available, we had no complaints about the breakfast",
        "We had breakfast included which I recommend as it can get pricey",
        "My Fiance and I ate at two of the restaurants at the resort, the Chess Restaurant and the Sandros restaurant, both of which were really nice and really friendly, both again compared to the rest of Bali quite pricey however when you stay in Nusa Dua you expect prices at resorts to be quite a lot higher than the general average, we were paying around 400,000 a meal with the main and drinks",
        "All in all the resort was a very nice location, very nice grounds and very nice staff to match, you can see the resort really needs to keep up its renovations and improve their in-room entertainment but generally it is a very nice, quiet and relaxing place to stay",
        "If were to return to Bali we would stay at this resort again and hopefully see our only complaints resolved",
        "in the morning!! How much earlier do you have to go to get such basic items??",
        "we paid for a 5 star hotel and expect a 5 star buffet",
        "not a 4star buffet",
        "We are not even sure if it even meets this 4 star grade",
        "we are not fussy people",
        "Only expecting to get what we paid for",
        "We do tolerate being short changed",
        "It's expensive for what it is",
        "(well it may as well be) The room is old and the airconditioining barely works",
        "The fridge doen't work and I'm still waiting for someone to come and repair it",
        "I suppose I take some of the blame as I booked the room with one of the hotel aggregator websites (hotels",
        "Very dissapointing as I take 2 o/s family holidays to Phuket and this could have easily have became my new fave destination",
        "I've stayed in countless hotels and the buffet breakfast wa the worst ever experienced",
        "We stayed in a Deluxe room on the third floor for a period of 3 days during our visit",
        "This hotel offers value for money compared to equally large hotels in Nusa Dua, at only $190US a night, I felt the price reflects what we got, probably just leaning on the overpriced side",
        "We stayed during the busy peak season, and not to my surprise our room was not ready on check-in, we were offered 2 free drinks in the lobby bar and a few snacks to chew on while we waited",
        "30 minutes later we had a delightful porter show us to our room, as well as giving a quick guide of the resort and facilities on offer in the room, a tip well-earned for this young man!",
        "Another feature I would of liked, is a channel dedicated to show your racked up expenses during your stay, this always helps you watch your budget, and I find it extremely useful in other hotels",
        "We had dinner at Chess Restaurant and the pizza bar by the pool, people below have mentioned they felt it cost too much, well if you come from Australia, the meals are very affordable in my eyes, even the mini bar is well priced IMO compared to Australia, so we got stuck right in",
        "We stayed here for 9 nights and had a great time",
        "We enjoyed hiring the bicycles out, and we see so much more of the area by doing so",
        "We would definantly choose this hotel again",
        "There is nothing negative that I could point during my stay of 4nights and 5days",
        "Before I booked I really spent long time to choose this hotel",
        "Comments , photos ,great nature ,traditional Balinese style made me focus on this area",
        "We really love Nusa Dua region , totally different than Kuta",
        "I would prefer Nusa Dua next time",
        "This hotel has a greatest garden I have ever seen in my life , like a paradise",
        "I like the back garden at the beach side",
        "About the see to be honest I was expecting to see better see like Maldives but here it was different",
        "See is not that much grazy blue & green",
        "we really loved them",
        "It is very nice place",
        "I really highly recommend this paradise hotel to everyone",
        "It was amazing that we could spend 2 nights here in Nusa Dua Beach hotel, as a matter of fact, we really want to extend our stay at this beautifull hotel",
        "The staff was very very very friendly, as if we are the king",
        "We got the room facing the central stage area at 1st level",
        "It was so minimalist, yet still comfort enough to use and clean",
        "It's like there's never ending wow experience with this hotel",
        "Since, we love to eat! And yes, it fits us out",
        "And not to forget the sandy beach, it was so comforting",
        "We even had a chance to see the sun rise at the early morning with clear sky (luckily)",
        "Since the weather is cold breeze windy in the morning, we decided not to swim at the sea to keep our son cold",
        "We also decide to follow your bathroom interior design guys, just to remind us where we have been before",
        "It was so inspiring",
        "It was clean and fresh everytime we enter the room",
        "I had a lovely room (think it was an upgrade)",
        "I will return!!",
        "The resort is looking amazing after your upgrades and we look forward to coming back again",
        "We came here on a singapore/bali combo",
        "This was a lastminute booking and we were amazed",
        "We didnt realise this was one of the small hotel of the world when we booked it and were pleasantly surprised!!!! The staff were pleasant",
        "we had a standard room",
        "I would recommend this hotel to anyone",
        "The room was situated at the back of the complex, took us ages to figure out how to get back to reception or anywhere else from it, but, for one night, we knew we wouldn't have a prime position",
        "The room boy told us it always did that! The furniture in the room was scuffed and worn and one night there was one night too many",
        "Because of this, we chose to dine away from the hotel so spent nothing more during our short stay than the cost of the room",
        "Breakfast the following morning was good, but the check out was poor - the computers were down and it took ages to obtain an account showing a nil balance",
        "The clerk didn't seem to believe this, and said she would email us if, once the computers were up and running, it should show that we owed them anything",
        "One of the receptionists asked if we had enjoyed our stay and when we told her about the state of the room she said it's because we had booked a Standard Room",
        "We have stayed at Nusa Dua beach resort for 6 nights",
        "Deluxe room are more spacious & modern, with nice modern bathroom, however matresses were still very tough(felt like sleeping on the floor) & pillows were also lumpy, so we didnt have a good night sleep for 6 nights",
        "Breakfast is nice but needs more variety of bread(they had only variety of white breads), cheese (had only 1 type of cheese) & salami(had only ham & chicken roll), & if you want to order eggs benedict it is extra charge",
        "They had lunch at kids club which was fine but the price of juices was the same as price of lunch which we found out about at the check out ( i think it's a little too expensive to pay for a glass of apple juice $5 AUD)",
        "We didnt use spa or salon facilities due to being over priced, if you go to town you'll find that spa prices 50% cheaper than at the resort, so as restaurants are very expensive, so we didnt eat in the resort, we had to go outside",
        "It has a beautiful Indonesian feel",
        "I have been there in 2009/2010 and just returned two days ago",
        "I am already planning 2012!",
        "Went for our honeymoon and it was perfect",
        "Go for it!!",
        "We had our wedding at the Nusa Dua, and it was beautiful",
        "We felt like we were treated like royalty",
        "We also had two spa packages, and the spa was the best we've been to",
        "We stayed here on our way back from Australia in January '11",
        "This being our first experience of a Resort Hotel I think we were pleasantly surprised,",
        "Maybe if we had been seasoned Resorties we may have had some issues with the sometimes tired looking wood in the rooms and beach loungers but for us it was a wonderful treat after 2 years of backpacking",
        "We didn't eat at the resort, instead we went outside the gates to a nearby market area to eat, easily 80% cheaper than the resort restaurants",
        "We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights",
        "The best sleep I have had on a holiday",
        "We will definately be back",
        "The Bar was a little overpriced, but still it is cool to enjoy cocktail sitting in the pool bar",
        "But it is very easy to take free shuttle bus to Bali Collection and enjoy excellent food for very affordable prices",
        "For a 4 1/2 **** it was okay",
        "Would I stay here again",
        "I travelled with my 16 Year old daughter and we were pleased with our choise",
        "We upgraded to the Palace room which included breakfast, high tea, cocktails in evening, delightful staff - could not have been more welcomed if we wanted! The choise of restaurants was excellent from Pizza to Japanese to tradtional Balinese cuisine",
        "All in all we had 8 days at the Beach Hotel and did not want to come home",
        "It's the second time for us at Nusa Dua Beach this time we brought our 2 young boys (6 & 4) with us",
        "We also loved the pool bar as part of it is close to the kids pools that we could watch the kids whilst having a bintang or 2",
        "Not to mention the spread at breakfast - the omlettes are surperb",
        "We're just counting down the days when we can return",
        "The room was good very well appointed with a king bed which was 2 singles pushed together only complaints was it was a little firm",
        "The resort is in a secured complex that lies within the secured area of Nusa Dua we felt very safe here at all times",
        "Over all I would definitely recommend this resort and would stay here again if coming to Bali again",
        "We have since been holidaying in other Asian countries up to 3 times per year",
        "As we had family who have 2 small children who wished to holiday with us over Easter we decided to choose Bali as the flying time from the east coast of Aus is only approx 5",
        "We booked this Hotel again based on our wonderful stay 5 years ago and we were not disappointed",
        "All the food we ate in a variety of the Hotel's restaurants and Bars was a very high standard, though I would have liked to see a different dinner and lunch menu at Chess Bar and Restaurant as when you ate at the Bar in the day it was the same menu in the outside Restaurant in the evening",
        "We can recommend this resort to any couple or family who are after a great value holiday in Bali just outside of lively Kuta; whilst you will find cheaper places it would be hard to beat the service and facilities on the beach",
        "We are planning to book and return in July!!! Love it!",
        "We have been staying at this hotel for 16 years and it nevers fails to disappoint",
        "We have recommended many people to stay here and none have been disappointed",
        "I was travelling with my mom and my sister and we really took avantage of the pool and beach",
        "Although comical we were both a little injured",
        "It is impossible not to get water everywhere! Everyday we soaked the floor",
        "The breakfast is unbelievable- hands down the best I have ever had",
        "I would definitely come back and stay here at this hotel",
        "I wouldn't reccommend this hotel at all and was very glad to leave it!!!",
        "I did not book this place,this is the place I was given when I booked a package deal with Singapore Airlines,I would had booked the Grand Hyatt or the Hard Rock Hotel in Kuta",
        "No weather channel on TV,I do not go on vacation to watch TV but I do like a weather channel to check the weather while I am there",
        "We were happily upgraded on our arrival only to find we were placed in the oldest rooms in the place",
        "Half the hotel is under construction and our room faced it all",
        "We were given a twin room by mistake",
        "We didn't complain as we spent most of our time around the spa area",
        "We did eat a couple of times at the italian restaurant and chess bar",
        "We cannot even begin to tell you how much we looked forward to the breakfast every morning! Such a variety and outstanding food! A tip would be to eat breakfast as late as you can manage to hold you over until dinner",
        "We attended the hotel's yoga class one morning",
        "It was a basic class, but it felt great to stretch after travelling",
        "The entire staff is there to make sure your stay is everything you hoped it would be and more",
        "We left Nusa Dua Beach Hotel/Bali with a smile on our faces, urning to come back",
        "I'm coming to the end of my stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa and I have to say it's been absolutely amazing",
        "The hotel itself is incredibly beautiful, when you drive up the driveaway along the architecture blows your mind, the food is fantastic, the rooms are clean and the staff are the best I have come across anywhere in the world",
        "We're also looking at renewing our wedding vowes in the next couple of years",
        "are renovating and hopefully it doesn't change the atmosphere too much",
        "We needed a location central to our dealer/customers in the Asia Pacific area, Bali fitted the bill perfectly and we could not of chosen a better hotel",
        "Even after seeing the photos, arriving at the resort still blew me away",
        "It looks amazing",
        "The main pool is great, although too warm - on really hot days it was a bit like a huge bath (personal opinion though) - not reall very refreshing",
        "The rooms were nice and clean, but I kind of expected more",
        "Over priced but food ok",
        "Their were renovations happening at the time but we never heard them",
        "All in all, I would stay there again",
        "I loved Bali and loved staying in the Nusa Dua area - so peaceful!!",
        "I have recently stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for 4 nights with my husband and 2 children (13 and 11), and can thoroughly recommend this hotel",
        "There were further renovations still going on while we were there (rooms only), but although we were told there was work going on, we did not hear a thing! We would definitely recommend this hotel and hopefully we will be able to return there for another holiday in the future",
        "Breakfast was superb and enough to keep me going all day",
        "The only part I did not enjoy was the sea, the beach was great and clean and as soon as the seaweed came in it was removed by cleaners on the beach",
        "The staff were delightful, though I must say I found the trainee staff (there were many of them) far more pleasant that the permanent staff",
        "Dew in the breakfast room greated me every morning by name, with a huge smile and made sure I had my cup of coffee",
        "I found it very easy to stock up the bar fridge with cheap beers bought at the Mini Mark",
        "Spa treatments at the hotel are rather expensive and much cheaper ones can be found outside the hotel but if I had the money I would prefer the hotel as I found them to be more professional than the one at Bali Collection",
        "It cost us just under 70 000R to be dropped off at the Centro Mall",
        "A day trip was organised through one of the taxi drivers and cost 500 000R for 8 hours, through the hotel it would have cost 800 000R",
        "we were met promptly at the airport by Made Widya, their top tour guide , who we developed a relationship with over the course of a week by using him for day long outings",
        "We enjoyed our 6 nights at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "The other pool needs the bottom painted and it would also be very nice",
        "The location on the beach was very good (though we have been to nicer beaches in other countries)",
        "The breakfast buffet was really, good ,though we always ate too much",
        "We would recommend this pretty hotel especially to anyone trying to stay within a budget",
        "However, the rooms (superior) were average (I would say three star hotel)",
        "We did take one bottle of water from the mini bar and had to pay 75",
        "Let's talk about a gross margin of 900%! Shame on you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel! I think it's really rood; not even a bottle of water in our hotel in Gothenburg costs so much",
        "We traveled from the US West Coast for a short trip to Singapore (2 nights) and Bali (3 nights)",
        "It took almost 36 elapsed hours to get from San Francisco to Bali but we found the Nusa Dua very comfortable and relaxing once we got there",
        "There was a choice of at least 6 restaurants and we tried most of them, except for the high end restaurant",
        "The resort seemed to be about half full while we there, which meant that we did not have to contend with large crowds on the beach, at the pool, or in the restaurants",

        "I stay up to 5 days! Thats was a memorable holiday with Family",

        "The hotel was beautiful and the grounds were lovely, we can't really fault them",
        "The food was very nice but on the expensive side and it took us a while to find alternative places to eat so we were hungry for a day! But once found there are plenty of alternative places within easy walking distance",
        "I usually travel on a shoe string and like to rough it so booking this hotel was a change for me due to having my mum with me, with that in mind I would not have changed the experience",
        "Rooms - good size (we had 2 adjoining with interconnecting door) and very comfortable",
        "We didn't bother as we were very happy where we were",
        "Italian dinner buffet looked fabulous, but the standard of the dishes presented were a let down",
        "Staff were invariably friendly, especially to the children (perhaps it helps by being friendly to them!) - in fact the only rude people there were some of the eastern European guests!",
        "we're walking for 20 min in this hot weather to the other hotels' beaches",
        "all the facilities in hotel re quite expensive",
        "and what i must say-during our one week holidays i've heard about more then 5 cases of money stealing,and finally we fall victim to this",
        "forgetting some small money in room,be sure u'll not find it coming back",
        "then manager lies to your eyes that it's happened for the first time and send u fruits",

        "I have only ever stayed in a Palace Club room, so can only comment on that",
        "Our visit was for two nights after a stay in Seminyak and Cepaka first, We always finish of our Bali holidays with a couple of nights in Nusa Dua or Jimbaran just to wind down and chill out",
        "I guess the rooms are becoming dated, but they have some much character and I have always found them to be very clean and well maintained",
        "They made many calls for me a and spent a lot of time with me, which I truly appreciated",
        "However, I find it to be quite charming because it also has the most character",
        "At Nusa Dua, we were reminded everyday that we were in Bali because of the design of the resort",
        "We took at shuttle past the newer hotels nearby and most looked pretty standard with convention posters up front and metal detectors like casinos",
        "They were going through renovations during our stay near the pool area but we were not disturbed at all",
        "Wear sunscreen even if it's cloudy! It was a beautiful resort and well kept, clean, quiet and the spa services were terrific",
        "One advantage is that nearly every restaurant we went to offered free transport to and from the hotel",
        "The room we had was absolutely fantastic",
        "One of the best we have stayed in",
        "They were also able to provide very good recommendations when we asked them",
        "we did a half day treatment, and it was wonderful! It is directly on the beach, which was perfect for post dinner walking around",
        "Other areas of hotel were undergoing refurbishment but we weren't disturbed by this at all",
        "Other reviews suggest this hotel feels like a complex and isn't really the real Bali and I'd agree",
        "I'd say the photos on the hotel web page made it look slightly larger than actually is, but not a criticism",
        "Didn't make use of spa area in the hotel, but it looked like it was having a refurbishment, so can't comment",
        "I'd recommend this resort for those enjoyimg a beach holiday setting, but if looking for more culture and the real Bali head for Ubud and some of the amazing hotels in that region",
        "After spending 4 nights in Kuta and Ubud, we headed to Nusa Dua",
        "We wanted to stay in a 5 star hotel for our final night in Bali, and so my parents and us (plus 1 child and a baby) went for NDBH",
        "We read most reviews and thought that it was a safe choice to go for, but sad to say how wrong we were!",
        "We found our rooms (mine and my parents) flooded!",
        "After that commotion broke up, we had to spend the next one hour shifting rooms in the middle of the night!",
        "This experience has really shaken us up quite badly since we had never experience this before after having been to Bali for 3 previous trips (in fact, never in all our travels!)",
        "It also left a bad taste for us, since it was my parents first trip to Bali",
        "It totally ruined our holiday after that!",
        "I somehow could not accept the ensued explanation of heavy downpour of rain",
        "In any case, I am not about to find out in my next trip to Bali",
        "I choose this hotel after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor, let me say this was a very good decision, the hotel is stunningly beautiful and is made in traditional bali style, I had booked the trip through a travel agent and the trip was very well organized we stayed there for 5 days from 15th to 19th Dec , the hotel staff was friendly and smiling always ready to help, I just have two complaints first the lift outside our room was not working so we had to walk a long way and second the hotel beach was not clean but I think that was out of the hotels control as it was rainy season, lastly with the ever increasing flow of Indians the hotel could use an Indian counter at the breakfast buffet, if you are going to bali stay here, bali is amazing and beautiful it has beaches, volcanoes, temples, palaces, culture, good food and friendly people",
        "We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel in September, where we had arranged to get married",
        "We also ate outside of the hotel by the main gate to nusa dua and at the bali collection, both of which were very good and better value",
        "The wedding went as planned thanks to Dwi who was an absolute star in making sure everything was perfect for us, we got married in the tropical gardens and it was perfect! The spa at the front of the hotel is stunning and very relaxing with a lovely lap pool and superb service",
        "Good heavens how it has changed, judging from the drive from the airport to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa",
        "Even so, we liked the Nusa Dua a lot",
        "Since our last stay, the pool area has been thoroughly remodelled - there are now two main pools - though we actually spent most of our time at the bliss-out beautiful and quiet spa pool",
        "Our room, 2014, was way back and in the cheapest category, yet it had an excellent bathroom, with a separate tub and walk-in shower, as well as a separate lavatory",
        "However, now that the hotel has come under the ownership of the Sultan of Brunei, it is being renovated to bring it up-to-date without sacrificing its Balinese style",
        "Breakfast is awesum, Overall it was a wonderful experience and without any hesitation i would strongly recommend this hotel",
        "I stayed in Nusa dua beach hotel during in november 2010",
        "I was with my spouse and mother",

        "We arrived at the Hotel very tired after a long flight and received a good welcome",

        "We had lots of fun feeding the squirrels and birds with pieces of fruit and nuts from the mini bar",
        "There were plenty of bars and restaurants and we ate and drank at the lobby restaurant and at the beachside restaurant with nice views of the sea",
        "I particularly recommend having one of these as soon as possible after a long flight and just before leaving on one but honestly I could start every day with one of these",
        "We set up some tours with the aid of the hotel tour guide and recommend discussing the options with the guide to find what suites your interests",
        "We did eat out of the hotel a couple of times just for a change of scene but we didn't find anywhere that bettered the food and service at the hotel",
        "Believe me, whoever wishes or have already planned to stay in this hotel, would be for nice surprise",
        "Beautiful I stayed for 3 days and could not find a single instance or area where it falls short",
        "I would like to know",
        "wish it had been longer! The staff was most gracious and they made you feel like you were truly honoring them by visiting in their hotel",
        "The upgrade included breakfast, both buffet and order off the menu, an afternoon tea with tea sandwiches and dessert- (although we never participated in this offering our son did and he raved about it",
        "Needless to say we never ate dinner at the hotel we just ate at these events",
        "Luckily, the hotel had vast green grounds with ponds, ducks, swans, so that we could venture out and have good time without tiring my son",
        "The breakfast area has a huge pond with lots of fishes, that meant, he ate without fuss (he was feeding the fishes and i was feeding him!)",
        "Every evening local stalls of handicrafts sat within the hotel premises, that meant I could do all my shopping without breaking my budget or tiring my son",
        "We could go to the beach anytime we want or come back anytime it was needed",
        "Local women will walk around asking to give 1 hr massages for like $5-$10 US dollars",

        "We stayed 10 nights in September then headed to Jimbaran (Intercon",
        ") for 8",
        "The night we were to leave, our plane was delayed 3 days - we could have stayed anywhere but headed back to the NDBH because of it's",
        "Also the main pool is to be renovated, so out of action for next 3 months - I hope they also renovate the Lagoon pool because this appeared to be in a greater need of renovation, but it was still pleasant to swim in (and I'm very fussy about cleanliness and hygiene)",

        "I would say 3+ or 4 if im very generous",

        "It was very interesting and beautiful! Try to go later in the day to get a picture of it at sunset!",
        "We stayed in a Palace club room and we were treated so well from the moment we arrived",
        "In fact we didn't ever need an evening meal as we were always so full",
        "We went for a relaxing holiday as we had just done a tour of New Zealand and wanted a rest on our way home to England, we stayed 9 nights and wished it was much longer",
        "I have mixed feelings about the Nusa Dua, while the location is good, all the beach hotels in Nusa Dua have a great location, so it isn't anything special to write home about",
        "However, the Front Desk staff was not less accommodating than I had hoped, having booked a large group stay here",
        "Now, I did not mind the duck pond view, but the noise at sun-up was more alarm clock than I wanted",
        "When I asked the front desk about a move because of the noise, and mentioned my \"upgrade' was less than the 'standard' room of my friend, I was disappointed at the attitude of the staff",
        "They told me they would have to let me know later - I never heard from them",
        "However that said, it wasn't any better here than at any hotel along this strip of beach",
        "It is so spectacular that I thought there had been a mistake",
        "From that first moment until the last moment when we left we were treated so very well",
        "We saved a lot of money by not paying tourist rates",
        "The staff,the hotel and the location with that Balinese feel to it",
        "PS; we have already stared to organise our next trip in Jan 2011and yes we are going back",
        "The staff was great though seemed a bit overloaded due to the mad rush during the christmas time we visited",
        "We stayed as Palace Club Guests in Late November- Early December for 10 nights and were very impressed with the standard of the hotel in general",
        "Free Internet access was part of the service and we were offered an upgrade to an ocean view suite",
        "We declined as we just loved being able to walk out of our room directly to the duck pond",
        "I must comment on the Cherry Tiramisu served at the Poolside Pizzeria",
        "It was without a doubt THE BEST Tiramisu I have had ANYWHERE in the world",
        "I had to have one every night during my stay",
        "It was so divine that I am still dreaming of it",
        "We also loved the sandy lagoon pool and the location along the beach front allowed for a lovely walk after dinner",
        "A++++++++++++++++++++++ to this hotel",
        "We can't wait to return",
        "This trip i managed to visit nusa dua with my family",
        "Took around 25 minutes from airport to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & SPA, we felt the ambiance once we enter the hotel, very comfortable and elegance hotel",
        "Clean, well maintance beach",
        "I love very much the beach with sun chair and swimming pool",
        "Simply Beautiful ,nice service,nice beach and a lot of activities,we will go next time for sure!!!",
        "It is a good place to stay to be near watersports, jetski, parasailing etc",
        "Unfortunatley time was limited but we did a lot of walking so that we could take in the sights",
        "We also spent 3 nights in Seminyak",
        "Thanks to Gin and all the girls in the palace club lounge the most polite gentle people I have had the pleasure to meet",
        "On Monday the 7th Dec my parents, sister (18years) and I (21 years) arrived at the airport and was surprised to find that going through customs was quiet quick and easy considering we had to claim items of alcohol because it was more than 1 litre per person",
        "We arrived after a quick drive at the N",
        "The surroundings of the hotel were beautifully decorated and we couldn't wait to see our rooms",
        "We were offered cocktails on arrival and met our hosts for our holiday, Gin (a wonderful and very helpful host) showed us around to the spa, in the direction of the pools and to our rooms",
        "The glass door controls the aircon when opened the aircon turns off and when closed it starts back up again",
        "Although it is also controlled by a switch in the room",
        "The other two pool situated near the beach are lovely and opened 7:00am - 8:00pm",
        "We stayed in the palace club rooms so we were entitled to breakfast, free afternoon tea 3:00-5:00pm, free cocktail (2 hours 6:00-8:00pm) and free juice and soft drink throughout the day and night (24hr/7) at the palace club which also has free internet and is where i am typing this now",
        "We went to the indonesian dance show where we listened to wonderful music and watched some great dancing",

        "We had booked the honeymoon package and got a complimentary couple massage",
        "A must try",
        "I have stayed for 4 days in this hotel",
        "Generally, I have good time",
        "For example, TV is small, still CTR, Room's Internet didn't work well, I could not use well, it was very slow, even couldn't open web page",
        "I chose Deluxe Room, and couldn't feel how deluxe it was",
        "So, if you want to shopping outside and look around Bali, it may not be good place to choose to stay",
        "It would take around 50,000 Rp to discovery shopping centre with bargan taxi at outside gate of hotel",
        "It is very easy to find taxi in Bali",
        "About hotel taxi, someone have recommended to use, but it is very expensive",
        "From hotel to Bali airport, it would cost 150,000 Rp by hotel taxi, conversely, only cost 60,000 by local taxi",
        "If you want to stay hotel for relaxation, it will be good place to stay, good condition pool and beatiful beach",
        "I stayed again in Nusa Dua Beach, and it was as perfect as ever before",
        "Compared to other hotels in the same price range, it is probably the most beautiful and generous place in Nusa Dua",
        "My family and I have travelled extensively and I would definatley say this hotel has the BEST room service we have ever had",
        "The hotel has many restaurants and they are all delicious and of a very high standard (for Bali), the food here is beautiful but very expensive, after 10days we would have spent a few thousand AUD dollars on food and drinks here",
        "One thing I definately recommend, is eating at the hotels seafood buffet on Sunday nights and having the buffet at the cultural show which I think is on a wednesday night",
        "One thing we did do was use the babysitting service and we highly recommend using these ladies",
        "All in all, we would not stay here again simply because of the location and the price of food/beverage",
        "As for Bali itself I feel that it is terribly overrated",
        "I wasted two days of my vacation getting there and back from Kuala Lupur",
        "We had an excellent stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa in august 2009",
        "We choosed the hotel following recommendation on tripadvisor",
        "Staff is very good, they want to help you in every issue; we did not have any problem during the stay",
        "-The room is on the ground, with acces to excellent garden; sometimes we received fruits in the room",
        "-On the beach the food is ok, but for dinner we definitely recommend the Balinese restaurant Raja`s with excellent food and service",
        "We choose -one evening -a very nice restaurant on the beach of Jimbaran where we watched the sunset and enjoyed a great dinner, named \" Sea Side Cafe\"",
        "During european summer the day is short in Bali, 6 pm is already dark, but is definitelly worthy to visit Bali and Singapore",
        "We stayed in Singapore 4 days our way back home",
        "Overall we had a great experience and we will definitely return to Nusa dua Beach and Spa",
        "We stayed here during October",
        "We enjoyed cocktails at the pool bar and walking along the beachfront",
        "I was a bit disapointed witht the beach as it looked pretty rocky and there were warning signs about sea urchins so I stayed away",
        "I cant understand the size of the TVs or lack of DVD player",
        "Overall, I wasnt too bad but fairly expensive for bali",
        "Next time I would like to try laguana and Westin",
        "They also kept my room desposit which was more than the daily rates I paid, for over a week and I had to call up to get it back",
        "We went to Bali for our first wedding anniversary",
        "For a romantic break, it was the perfect location",
        "We first noticed in the taxi from the airport, where we had to drive through a security checkpoint at the entrance of the Nusa Dua resort area(a result of the Bali bombings",
        ") The guards were very polite and obviously had our safety in mind, but none the less, one got the feeling that we were being isolated somewhat from the rest of the island",
        "The epitomy of Nusa Dua as a tourist trap was however the Bali Collection - a walled complex of restaurants and shops, equipped with its own security guards, shuttle transport back and forth from the hotel and information desks",
        "Prices here reflected Nusa Dua in general, although we did discover that we could bargain at restaurants for free salad bars, welcome drinks or desserts",
        "This was actually very pleasant, as we were pretty much the only two tourists on the mountain",
        ") Although experienced hikers, we wouldn't have had half the fun without one",
        "Based in Nusa Dua, we got the best of two worlds",
        "i stayed here from the 1st to the 11th of october and i can confidently say if ther are any reviews saying anything other than its fantastic i would be baffled ?",
        "we did look at some of the brand new hotels on the strip but they could have been anywhere in the world the NDBH is a lovley little piece of bali",
        "the rooms in palace club were loveley and the palace club blimey you could get away with not spending a penny if you wanted there is so much food !!",
        "we would recomend at least 3 resturaunts",
        "the spa is great and i would recomned a visit as you get so well looked after compared to uk standards i have exerianced",
        "all in all we will go back to bali and we will stay here even though we drank and visited a lot of the more modern hotels the NDBH is like bieng in a palace in the days of the raj",
        "Yes this is the oldest hotel on the stretch, but with that comes character that represents the island of Bali; we took the opportunity to nose at some of the other hotels as we ventured around",
        "There are amany restuarants in the hotel which we used early on in our holiday until we got our bearing and wondered down to the Bali Collection ( aka Bali Centre - 15 minute walk along the beach path) where there are many restuarants about half the price of the hotel; although I didn't think the hotel was that expensive compared top others we have stayed in",
        "If you venture in to the village outside of the gates, it's cheaper again",
        "We had to depart at 6",
        "30 am for an excursion and many loungers had towells on at this time!! Any way our prefernce is for the beach, where the smiley and attentive staff are happy to bring you drink and food while you have a good chat with the beach sellers",
        "This is just our opinion, but compared to other hotels in the Far East and Indian Ocean it compares very favourably with those in the same price bracket",
        "If it's good enough for U2 & Ronald Reagan (allegedly) it's good enough for most of us",
        "Do go to the Balinese restaurant by the pool, it was amazing in every way",
        "The lobby bar is what it is but does serve a mean cocktail",
        "Thankfully it turned out to be a couple of women in the spa as the alternative would make me feel uncomfortable",
        "Hidden gem, best ever hotel with incredeble luxeury",
        "I stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel with my Boyfirend whilst holidaying in Bali",
        "After discussing this with the manager we were upgraded as an apology for free - this was well worth it as we were moved to a better located room and had no compliants",
        "That was until we went to Kuta beach",
        "In a way, we were really glad that we spent our entire days at the beach while at Nusa Dua",
        "You need to rely on the taxis to go to the town, which cost you 80,000 rupiah return (although found out later that we could have negotiated for less",
        "We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for 6 nights for summer vacation during August",
        "The overall feeling of our room was that it wasn't too clean",
        "Of course you see that it is over 20 years old but the wonderful garden landscape",
        "Palace Lounge was excellent, witht one of the best marinated salmons I ever tasted",
        "We had Palace rooms, and were upgraded to a suite, without asking",
        "The biggest problem of our stay was the dampness of the room which I feel is due",
        "to the airconditioning",
        "The owner drove us back to the Hotel free of charge",
        "We decided on the hotel after reading the reviews on here and finding a good deal online",
        "The grounds are stunning and the service is first class and we felt at home instantly",
        "We used the hotel facilities only really during the day and traveled to Kuta or Seminyak most evenings",
        "Despite the initial damp problem I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the Nusa Dua area at a reasonably priced hotel - we had a fantastic holiday and will stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel again when we return next year",
        "I'd stay in Ubud or Seminyak if I was on vacation! But for the conference, it was fine",
        "It didn't seem as luxurious as some of the neighbouring hotels (with their big day and night beds out available to lounge on in the evenings)",
        "We married in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel in June",
        "Although we had bad expirience when we arrived - our room wasn't cleaned properly, had very bad smell of dumpness and we were asking for different room",
        ") So the folowing day we were asking to move again",
        "All what I wanted just a clean room with the same location as we had at first",
        "Thanks for Reni (our wedding coordinator) finaly we got what we wanted",
        "It still offers a really high standard of service, well equipped rooms and a fabulous beachfront location",
        "Lots of eating options within the hotel, although I must confess we ate out on all but one of our 11 nights as it was considerably cheaper and we wanted to explore",
        "For example when I told them that i needed to leave very early in the morning to head to the airport they were concerned that I would miss my breakfast and insisted on making up a breakfast box for us to take with us",
        "We booked standard rooms",
        "Of course, we can eat outside the Nusa Dua area for less but for an international hotel it is not overpriced",
        "I would counsel potential guests to disregard the snobbery evidenced by other reviewers",
        "While this may have been a 4+ star in a former life it is now at best 3",
        "The resort is over 20 years old & has not been renovated in that time and it shows",
        "If you arrive at night it looks very impressive & it is only by day that you can see just how shabby it is",
        "The room itself is dated with electrical problems ( lights turning themselves on & off at will ) dirty showers ( probably due to the age rather than cleaning staff ) mouldy couch & complimentary bed bugs",
        "Once in the pool, if you manage to dodge the balls being thrown around, you will notice a thick carpet of algae covering both the island & swim up bar walls",
        "After 3 meals in the hotel we started looking elsewhere",
        "I would probably consider the Westin or the Laguna if we returned to Nusa Dua",
        "We were in a group of 15 (extended family vacation)",
        "Overall our experience was very good; however, the management needs to greatly improve their beach safety facilities - there are NONE",
        "It was just bad luck and can happen to swimmers anywhere",
        "They could not even attempt to throw us a ring to grab onto, since there were none",
        "We filed an \"incident report\" with management and never heard back from anyone",
        "Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel as a good full-service, resort-style hotel -- not quite as nice as the Grand Hyatts and Oberois of the world, but a reasonable approximation for far less coin",
        "We had a very long flight to Bali with 24 hours of travelling but on arrival, the beautiful hotel and resort and the staff soon erased the memory",
        "The hotel and it's grounds are beautiful and maintainence was second to none",
        "I scanned through a large number of hotel reviews in Nusa Dua Beach area before deciding on this property and had absolutely no regrets about my choice",
        "It was such an amusing and hilarious incident",
        "I must say that besides , Westin and Laguna, which also occupied the same stretch of beach , NDBH offered the best beachfront with spotless white sand and most importantly ,a large number of clean beach loungers",
        "We spent a lot of time lazing on the loungers and were constantly entertained by the antics of the mischievous squirrels playing in the trees nearby",
        "We had a few sumptuous lunches at the two restaurants near the pool",
        "We ate there twice and truly savoured the sweet, fresh seafood and tender ,silky and exquisite sashimi",
        "At other times , we also took a shuttle bus to Bali Collection for our shopping needs and dinner as well",
        "Prices of meals there were cheaper and there were also more varieties of food to choose from but we still preferred the quality of food at the hotel restaurants",
        "We had a fun time at this resort and would recommend this place to anybody looking forward to a relaxing and idyllic holiday",
        "When we arrived at the hotel we immediately felt very welcome and valued as guests",
        "One is the classical one, with comfortable sunbeds around it, and it has a poolbar in the swimmingpool",
        "The restaurant right next to the beach is really good and a pleasant alternative if u want to stay on the hotel grounds",
        "If u want to be guaranteed a luxurious and comfortable stay - book this hotel",
        "We loved it!!!",
        "We stayed at the resort for seven nights in a Palace Club room from 8th to the 15th June",
        "It was well worth the extra money, it included breakfast at the Palace Club lounge, afternoon tea and sandwiches, cake and scones, and then for two hours in the evening cocktails and canapes",
        "We prefer the pool/garden areas",
        "We did not eat many meals as we seem to have had enough to eat after the cocktails and canapes",
        "I had a Balinese massage at one of the parlours there, it was $15 US for one hour, amazing, and a lot cheaper than the hotel",
        "We fly with Singapore Airlines, they are just simply the best and we do a lot of travelling",
        "To conclude we had a fantastic holiday and would certainly go back again, but not too soon as being a Travel Consultant I like to check out other destinations as well, so that I can advise my customers",
        "It was nice to be there, we had a good time but won't go back to this resort unless it's given a complete makeover",
        "we stayed at this hotel for a week at the beginning of June 2009 with my husband for our 5 year wedding anniversary",
        "i did lots of research and finally chose this hotel and it was the best decision",
        "we arrived around 1pm after a transfer of about 20 mins from the airport",
        "we were greeted with cold towels and a drink",
        "we had to wait about 1/2 hr for our room to be ready so we had a quick look around and were stunned! the hotel was beautiful",
        "we had booked a standard room which was lovely and more than adequate, however as it was a special occasion we enquired about an upgrade and after looking at a few rooms, we upgraded to a palace room for $20 a night",
        "it was amazing",
        "it was a 2 mins walk to the pools and the lobby",
        "we did not have access to the palace lounge as we paid suck a low rate for the upgrade which i was disappointed about but soon got over it! the room was very clean with a turn down service every night",
        "the guest relations manager deisy was lovely and so accomodating",
        "we had breakfast every day overlooking a pond and gardens",
        "we also ate at Raja's which was one of our fave meals and we ate at the chess bar",
        "we took the free shuttle from the hotel to the nearby bali collection mall twice which is nice to have a look around the shops and have dinner - it is a little cheaper than the hotel",
        "we booked a taxi from the counter for a day trip and a trip to a temple it was probably more expensive but thought we would rather pay a bit more and go thorugh the hotel",
        "i could go on and on about this hotel as we had a such a memorable time",
        "we would recommend this hotel to everyone and def going back there in the future",
        "Normally I dont do anything like this but on this occasion I believed that I should write something about the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa",
        "Specifically we wanted a tropical beachfront resort to warm our bones in the Aussie winter and we got all of that and a lot more than we really expected",
        "The other facilities such as the gym, lap pool, kayak & winsurfer hire, internet room, games room, ATM, bank, resort shop, room service, swim-up pool bar, bike hire, taxi counter, consierge, duty managers and so on make the resort a wonderful place to stay, so much so that we will be returning in 2010",
        "It is naturally tidal and at its best at high tide, but low tide is ok also",
        "This was our first trip to Indonesia (let alone Bali) and we were traveling with a 2-yr old, so we thought it better to splurge a little and pay for a nicer place where we wouldn't have to worry about anything",
        "We booked at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel after reading the reviews and were very happy we did",
        "The breakfast buffet was nothing wonderful, but it was fine",
        "The food at the Pizzeria, on the other hand, was quite good, and we had an excellent Balinese dinner at Raja's restaurant (both within the hotel)",
        "There is no internet in the rooms, but it is available at the business centre for a fee",
        "I am also pleased to report that we came away with zero mosquito bites - a small thing, perhaps, but we have stayed at other resorts where we ended up scratching our arms and legs for a week after we got home",
        "We really knew that we had made the right choice, however, after my wife had a bad fall while we were exploring elsewhere on the island",
        "Overall, we were very pleased with the Nusa Dua and highly recommend it",
        "After going through many different catalogues and destinations we finally chose Bali for our honeymoon getaway and we weren't disappointed",
        "We liked Nusa Dua Beach hotel and Nikko Bali hotel the most out of all the offered hotels in travel agency catalogues",
        "We arrived at the hotel at 3am",
        "The hotel has many different restaurants and bars but they are all quite expensive (it is after all a 5 star hotel)",
        "We checked in at the Palace Club (same as the Club at the Conrad)",
        "The bathroom was smaller than the Conrad with older features, but it was perfect for what we were looking for",
        "Where the Conrad had all sorts of water features, the NDBH has gorgeous grounds with beautiful landscaping and wonderful Bali features",
        "It has great landscaping with multiple restaurants, bars, pools, etc",
        "An advantage the NDBH has over the Conrad is the lack of noisy water sports off it's beach",
        "Overall, I would highly recommend the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "We have stayed at three Hotels in Nusa Dua and I would rate this one the best",
        "We stayed for three nights with our 12 year old in the last week of May 2009",
        "The restaurants look beautiful, but we preferred to eat in nearby restaurants",
        "The choices are not too great, but it is fairly OK",
        "Overall, it was a wonderful stay",
        "Also stayed at the Bali Water villa 4+5 in Ungasan which is the most amazing place I've stayed in so far, yes out did the Evason Phuket!! see my other reviews :)",
        "Good wheel-chair disabled facilities t/o hotel",
        "Rooms were in need of a revamp, old floor boards + bath rooms",
        "We married at Nusa Dua in April",
        "Everything about this hotel was perfect from the moment we arrived",
        "The Hotel is simply GREAT, we all oved it even our 18 months baby",
        "We came to this hotel as part of our honeymoon in July07 and we were in no way disappointed it was like staying in a little slice of paradise between the gardens, the pool area and the private beach it was out of this world",
        "We stayed at the Nusa dua beach resort for 9 nights at the end of April in the Palace Club rooms",
        "Every day we were greeted by name and welcomed into the Palace Club",
        "The free internet although slow was still good and we were able to check in online for our return flights with Singapore Airlines and print off the boarding passes",
        "Would definately return to this hotel if we went back to Bali",
        "We needed to be close to the airport so decided to move from Ubud and have a couple of night in Nusa Dua - whilst there are more modern and flashy properties the service and style of this hotel are a winning combo , couple with good value rates especially for the Palace Club - a worthwhile upgrade for the money I beleive",
        "Next time I would probably try out one of the other hotels along the strip if staying for longer but several years later the service is still very good and me enjoyed our short stay",
        "I have to add that we found all staff genuinely welcoming, professional, attentive and very helpful",
        "We will definately be going back due mostly to their wonderful treatment of all their guests",
        "We were never in it except to sleep and change for dinner etc",
        "We were tempted to laze by this pool many times because it is so peaceful, but just never got there",
        "we couldn't tear ourselves away from the beachfront!",
        "This hotel is older than some of the nearby ones, but it has the charm the other's don't",
        "We stayed a week this year , but next year plan to stay 2-3",
        "My husband and I stayed at this hotel in one of the palace club suites because of a friend's recommendation and we loved it! What an amazing deal because you get a spectacular breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails in the palace club",
        "The setting there is so elegant and refined",
        "At first I was surprised how many questions they asked but then found it is polite in Balinese culture to ask a lot of questions",
        "My husband and I still talk about the breakfasts there, they were sooo delicious and probably the best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel",
        "I got a couples massage with my husband and then the Luhlur later in the week",

        "We have been to Bali a lot the over years and had driven down to Nusa Dua a few times but never stayed there as we considered it to far removed from the 'real Bali'",

        "The rooms were cleaned everyday and the service was wonderful, we noticed one time the cleaners had actually picked up our clothes from the floor and folded them for us - something I am not used to! We were in a corner room and were right next to the stair case to go to ground level, we didn't really hear much noise outside, but you could hear the cleaner's cart some days",

        "There was also a pool which was outside the Day Spa and next to the tennis courts which was at the front of the hotel, this pool was right next to our room and was fantastic, it was always very quiet being next to the beauty spa and was very clean",
        "We rented a scooter and were able to drive ourselves to a lot of the restaurants out of the gates, and had an enjoyable time every night",
        "It is so much cheaper",
        "We recently stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort and had 4 nights there",
        "The only thing which was a bit inconvenient was the fact other restaurants were a little bit futher from the hotel so if you decide to eat at the hotel it is a bit more expensive(but then this is Nusa Dua-bit more upmarket) It was very quiet compared to Legian/Kuta but then that was the reason we stayed there before going to stay at Legian",
        "The squirels were abundant but totally cute to watch",
        "We stayed in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our anniversary",
        "They leave us with a message in the room before the check-out date to let us know we can still stay in the hotel lounge after check-out and extended discount for massage in the hotel, etc",

        "It is absolutely excellent and worth the money",
        "The staff there said the spa lap pool has underwater music facilities, though i really cannot hear, it is very relaxing and enjoyable",
        "I tried Well Being Spa in Seminyak (a local spa outside) as well at USD64 for 3 hours, it is absolutely not comparable, worth to pay more in the hotel",
        "Writing this review is a hard one for me because Nusa Dua hotel is not normally the kind of hotel that I would enjoy, however this hotel certainley swayed my opinion in their favour",
        "If you are a diver then I would recommend the dive centre",
        "I completed my advanced padi while I was out there and felt all the way that I was in good hands",

        "The hotel and our room was very clean, we were happy with our accommodations",
        "The hotel is in a secluded gated 'community' with several other 5 star hotels (the Westin is right next door) and if we wanted to explore anywhere outside the hotel, we had to take a cab",
        "The only person that was really helpful was the Head Concierge (we can't remember his name, it started with a S)",
        "We're from the U",
        "Unfortunately you had to be at the pool by 7am to secure beds which I found disappointing",
        "After 30 mins we were told it would be another 30 mins",
        "5 hours until we became frustrated and asked to be told exactly when we could check-in rather than waiting around like lemons",
        "We complained and were moved to another room which was an improvement but was not as nice as a 3* place we had just come from in Legian (for half the price)!",
        "If it weren't for the poor service and the rooms which were not up to standard this hotel would have been rated 4 or 5, just expected better for the money we paid out",
        "Ok a little about us, Male 34 and new Wife 31",
        "Overall we had a great time at this hotel, we stayed in the Palace Club Suite and had the privilages of Breakfast, Afternoon Tea and Evening Cocktails",
        "All these functions are served by Butlers or to us commoners waiters/ress",
        "This added benifit i would recommend! The staff are all very warm and welcoming, which we found to be a bit of fresh air! they always said hello from the manager down to the cleaner/gardener would always stop and smile and ask how you are?",
        "If you go to the Nusa Dua area (outside the gates) most resturants will give you a lift home F",
        "We spent most our afternoons by the spa pool as the sunbeds by the main pool where always taken, i did try on a couple of occasions to find beds at 8am but found towels everywhere with no-one on them ggrrrrrr",
        "Semenyak (is that right??) is a cool place as well and another $10 will get you there as well, great for sunsets as is Jimbiran Bay",
        "If you just want a relaxing holiday then Nusa Dua has that to offer and we found it perfect for our needs as if we wanted a quite night then we stayed at the hotel or if we where in the mood for a night out then in a taxi we would go!!",
        "We also found the mixture of nationals to be good as well with Brits, Dutch, Thez Germans, Italians, Spainish, Ozzies, Chinese, France and the odd Yank / Canadian making it very interesting",
        "If i had to be sad the only down side to this resort is its beach and sea but having been to the maldives last year i think i will struggle to find beaches and seas like it is there!!",
        "Hello to the Dutch couple we met and told us about the orpanage",
        "Having waited so long to get away from all the stresses of work and such like, i can honestly say this is the first holiday where i felt i could have stayed for at least another week",
        "We stayed in the Nusa Dua Beach & Spa Resort for 1 week in late July, and we upgraded to a Palace Club room",
        "This was a fantastic decision to make and one we would not live to regret",
        "On arrival we were escorted to the Palace Club separate check-in area, a short distance away from the main reception",
        "Following that short and painless process we were taken to our Palace Club room just another short distance away",
        "When our Butler opened the door to our room (which was more like a suite) we were so delighted to see the fantastic room we had",
        "Where do I start?",
        "We went to the Bali Collection (lots of shops in an outside Mall) and made some purchases there but to be honest, it is about 2 or 3 times more expensive than the surrounding area because it mainly targets the tourists",
        "We spent 10 nights at Nusa Dua beach as the second leg of our honeymoon",
        "We received no special treatment for beig honeymooners and upon check in to our Palace Club room we were greeted by a very strong damp smell coming from the bathroom and balcony area",
        "The suite was more spacious and the living area and bedroom did not smell, however the bathroom was not as clean as I would have hoped and didn't smell very fresh",
        "The restaurants are fine we has nice shushi in maguro and lovely pizza's in Sandro's",
        "When we arrived we were shown straight to our room, with lovely garden views and you could see the sea in the distance room 3215, the bed was really lovely and big,the bathroom had everything you needed,i must say that it had the best power shower i have ever had",
        "What can we say other than, enjoy your stay, its just lovely",
        "This was our 4th visit to this Resort, and since on this ocassion we celebrated our wedding anniversary we decided to take the Honeymoon Package at the \"Palace Club Section\"",

        "We stayed at this resort from July 2 until July 6",
        "I would recommend this hotel to any travelers going to Bali",
        "However, the restaurant was not as I expected",
        "Though it is a large hotel, the palace club makes it feel very intimite",
        "We will defenitely come back!",
        "We stayed at the Nusa Dua Hotel for 3 weeks and it was fantastic! We had our wedding there and everything was perfect! The hotel made sure we had everything we wanted and we had a evening reception meal for the guests down at the beach and it was amazing",
        "The hotel and the grounds are the best and we are planning to go back next year for our first anniversary",

        "We plan to come again to this hotel again next year",
        "4 days and 3 nights were not enough for us to fill our hearts",
        "Perhaps this time, we will try out the spa and sports activities provided",
        "It was very cool",
        "Wish I was there",
        "While this is a very nice hotel, with a large pool and decent-sized rooms, I would not class it as one of the Leading Hotels of the World",
        "We stayed at this beautiful resort for 9 days on our honeymoon",
        "This must be one of the most amazing resorts that we have ever stayed at, hence the reason for it being part of the \"Leading Hotels of the World\"",

        "OK, this is a nice place, it has superb grounds, lovely pools and an impressive lobby",
        "I personally found the hotel massive, it is huge and it was quite crowded at the time we were there (first week of May), resulting in a not so intimate atmosphere",
        "Maybe we were not so lucky because of holidays in Europe, I don;t know, it could be that in another period of the year it is less crowded",

        "We stayed at the 5 star Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for 6 days",
        "We checked into one of their Palace club Suites over looking the sea, and was excellent",
        "It did the job - it's relatively near the airport, and we could get an early morning transfer",
        "We really didn't like the gated community of luxury hotels with a security guard to keep out the local people",
        "I stayed 5 days in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa last summer during my honeymoon in Bali",
        "It was our first experience of such a 5 star hotel and it was unbelievable",
        "2 superb swiimming-pools (we loved drinking cocktails sitting at the bar in the middle of the largest pool), 4 tasteful restaurants, a lovely beach in front of the hotel, and the amazing Palace Club facilities : a very large room with XXXL bed and jacuzzi, incredible breakfast and evening cocktail with meals from all around the world",
        "We just got back three days ago, spending four night there",
        "The building is a bit too old and defiintely needs renovation, and the rooms are okay, but the TV is from 80s and showing black and white while playing DVD for some reasons",

        "Our family also spent their nights in a delux room, and none of us had any complaints about the accommodation whatsoever",
        "As we were getting married in the hotel, we had booked our second week in a Palace Club room, but luckily for us we were given an upgrade to a Palace Club Suite",
        "The pool is beautiful and we all had a brilliant time in the all the pools",
        "The sea is just 30 seconds walk away from the pool, and it is lovely and warm",
        "In so far as the previous review to this hotel, I can only imagine he stayed in a different hotel to us",
        "We were in a party of 7, and none of us had any concerns in respect of our hotel",
        "I agree that the price of the food is high, and indeed you can get cheaper food outside the hotel, which we did do at times",
        "We tried the Westin nextdoor, and ate there and had a walk around, but to be honest I wasn't impressed with that hotel at all",
        "We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel, and plan to go back as soon as we can",
        "My only dislike was that I had to eventually go home",

        "The TV reminded me of one I had as a kid",
        "We stayed for two days",
        "Its not a bad hotel all considered, which is why so many people rate it highly, but in the end the room just got to us especially as the weather wasn't great and we wanted to spend more time in there",
        "In the end we changed to the Laguna (100m away, Westin between)",
        "The Laguna is just that bit better in every way - breakfast, TV, guest services (ask the butler for anything, he'll get it!), but most importantly benefitted from newly renovated rooms",
        "It the room is important to you, we recommend going for the Laguna as a preference, failing that the Westin",
        "(We even enjoyed the Discovery Partika in Kuta more than the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel)",
        "Overall, it was nevertheless an enjoyable experience",
        "Too big and crowded for our taste but it was our mistake",
        "If you like a big beach hotel, it is probably very good",

        "Before I booked my stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa I checked out every review for hotels in the area on this exact website",
        "And this hotel had the best and most consistent reviews for a good reason - it really is that good",
        "The mini bar is outrageous but you can catch a cab to Bali Collection shopping centre (5 mins) where you can buy cheap drinks at the supermarket, there's also a lady on the beach that sells from a modest stall (turn left on the beach) Food in Nusa Dua is expensive but you can always find cheaper fare at Bali Collection Shopping Centre but it's a bit like dining in Surfers Paradise so it's worth paying extra to eat along the beach",
        "I'll be back to this hotel",
        "We choose this hotel because we are curious",
        "The check in process was quite fast and we're allowed to get an early check in",

        "We just have one little problem",
        "The balcony was quite dirty when we first arrived",
        "But the problem was solved, after i talked to the housekeeper",
        "It has a beautiful landscape, compared with other hotels in Bali that i've stayed",
        "Overall, this hotel was quite pleasant and i think it's the most value hotel in Nusa Dua Area",
        "But, if i may give suggestion to the hotel i would suggest the hotel to do some renovations",
        "We stayed at this hotel on 12 January 2008",

        "The hotel is right on the beach which is beautiful and I particularly enjoyed our first night's dinner at the Chess restaurant by the sea",
        "I would definitely go back again",
        "My husband and I stayed here for 10 nights for our honeymoon, and I can honestly say it was one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen! It is surrounded by fountains and large ponds full of fish and lilies, with temple-like parts to all the buildings making it feel very special",
        "Overall I would absolutely recommend this hotel and resort, hardly any children there which was really nice, although it did have a good family friendly feel too",
        "The beach front location is great, it's quiet enough to relax but only a short taxi ride away from the bustle of Kuta",
        "Would definitely stay here again, in fact, I can't wait to go back",
        "I found this site after we booked and was a little concerned about the reviews I was reading",
        "I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE going on a honeymoon to Bali",
        "We especially loved the couples spa package",
        "It is heaven lying in the private fragipani flower bath sipping coconut milk and listening to the birds, feeling the ocean breeze and then slipping on a soft cotton robe and lounging on a private bale",
        "It is next to the spa and open to all guests",
        "There were only a few people there and it is so quiet and peaceful",
        "The food here was delicious and the prices were what we expected for an upscale, luxury beach resort",
        "We had booked a deluxe room and were very happy with it! We loved this place and can't wait to go back (one day",
        ") We really enjoyed the Balinese artwork and loved the beautiful wood carvings in the bedroon and throughout the hotel",
        "It was our 5th anniversary and actually our 2nd true vacation since our marriage, so we called it our 2nd honeymoon",
        "Anyway, for us, it was great, quiet and peaceful enough",
        "and beverage cost us an average of $30~40",
        "GREAT, I mean GREAT spa service",
        "Although it rendered us a great view and nature ambience, it stole some of out privacy",
        "We had to close the balcony doors completely, otherwise somebody could see we showering from the garden",
        "- compared to the other LDH i've been, it is clearly not a 5* top hotel",
        "We stayed in the Palace club and they made us feel very special",
        "The Palace Club gave us free soft drinks, afternoon tea and canapes and cocktails so was well worth the upgrade",
        "We loved this place and Bali in general",
        "We spent 10 nights at this hotel to celebrate our Silver Wedding",
        "It is definitely worth paying the extra for a Palace Club room",
        "It was an excellent tour, very informative and good value",
        "We would definitely recommend this hotel and would go back tomorrow!",
        "We stayed here as part of our honeymoon for 10 nights",
        "We stayed in the Palace Club which we could certainly recommend",
        "We found the food to be really good and enjoyed all the restaurants in the hotel",
        "Probably great if you have kids or just enjoy sunbathing, but it seems a waste to go all the way to Bali to stay somewhere like this",
        "We stayed in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 9 days in September 2007",
        "On the whole, it was an excellent hotel with plenty to do from tennis to squash to volleyball etc",
        "The first room we were given was extremely noisy (interconnecting doors) as we could hear clearly the room next door",
        "Upon complaining, however we were moved to a much quieter and bigger room",
        "Since the hotel is quite far from city center and shopping center, I was quite often had a lunch and dinner in the resto but its again, not that yummi and quite expensive",
        "Swimming pool was large and always so many people there but for alternative we can go to the beach for kayaking, snorkling or any other beach activities, but (again) its quite expensive",
        "It is a nice hotel (and probably nicer than most in Nusa Dua), but I don't believe very good value",
        "Don't pay more than $15 US for taxi to Hotel from Airport",

        "We stayed at this hotel for 9 nights",
        "On arrival we were taken into the palace club to check in where we were given a drink",
        "We were then taken to our room (Batur Suite)",
        "Towards the end of our stay we found out the we had been upgraded twice!",
        "We had free cocktails every night",
        "I went for the champagne ones!",
        "We definitely felt the benefit of the Palace Club, and took advantage of the excellent breakfast in the Club Lounge every morning, as well as the complimentary cocktails and nibbles every evening",
        "The staff all over the hotel were unfailingly polite, and all spoke good English, so we had aboslutely no problems on that front",
        "It's not big but is perfect for a cooling dip after sunning yourself",
        "Overall, we would defintely recommend this hotel",

        "I actually stayed of couple of nights at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel&Spa already 7 or 8years ago but not on holidays",
        "After 6 nights at Bali Hyatt, Sanur we moved to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "Brekafast was plentiful",
        "Apart from breakfast the only meal we had at hotel was one lunch- pizza and it was OK but too expensive! Service was good as expected at 5star hotel BUT not more - I did not feel the same \"personal touch\" as I did at Bali Hyatt",
        "I with a friend went to Nusa Dua for a nice relaxing break",
        "Which i have to say we had but i was totally disappointed in the lack of professionalism within the food and beverage departments within the hotel",

        "During my stay in Bali, I spent 5 nights at Nusa Dua and several nights at other hotels in Bali",
        "However, the hotel did not even compare to the more traditional hotels where I stayed, including Tandjung Sari in Sanur",
        "I travel the world for business and usually stay in five star properties",
        "This hotel ranks as one of the finest hotels I have visited",

        "We are pleased to report that it was not",
        "They had a very good stock of DVDs, which we made some use of",

        "I am sure we will go back within a couple of years",
        "We would definitely recommend to book the Palace Club room, it is more than worth your money! The complimentary afternoon tea, cocktail hour, great breakfast in the Palace club garden and excellent service are just a couple of reasons",

        "But overall, we're very statisfied with our stay here"

        "Thank you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa!",

        "Could not fault anything with the hotel",
        "Great value, location and service",
        "I'm glad there's a website like tripadvisor where you can be honest about your experiences for others to read",

        "30 so I did not really get to sleep a lot on my relaxing holiday as I still have children that wake afer midnight",
        "Swamped with annoying service as there were very few other customers & staff felt they should look busy, but were continually asked \"how were things?\" etc",
        "We booked bed and breakfast but also ate in the restaurants on a couple of occasions the food was very good the staff well they just could not do enough for you",
        "The atmosphere is relaxing and you can find the room and garden are surrounding with little squirrels",

        "Would love to go back sometime in the future",
        "The pools were lovely and you get a great spot of the beach too",
        "The staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable",
        "Beautiful layout however I think there should be publicity given to daily highlights like Tennis Comp etc at breakfast even perhaps the day before there were a lot of events that went unnoticed",
        "Staff polite, helpful and friendly",
        "Overall an excellent resort",
        "Urs the General Manager and all of his staff do everything they can to make sure your stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is an experience that you will not forget",
        "The location is both a plus and a minus depending on how you look at it",
        "This means you are a little captive to resort prices",
        "They keep the touts away, traffic is limited and it's very secure and this adds to the serenity",
        "Thank you",
        "Love coming back here! Always relaxed and peaceful",
        "But this is greatly let down by the deplorable conditions of the rooms",
        "I think that although anyone could argue this is symptomatic of a tropical climate, airing of rooms should be done regularly, with so much incense available, strange there is nothing to deodorize the rooms",
        "The female doctor was quite thorough and although after clinic hours 8pm arrived not 10 minutes after the call out which was I was extremely grateful for",
        "The service was excellent, however the strangest incident happened when my husband paid cash, the cashier at the salon did not give him any change, and only did so after he requested the change, he assumed they had thought it was a tip but still I don't think this is correct practice",
        "And would advise caution when paying",
        "This worked out to almost a half board stay, plus spa treatments, and return airport transfers, and food and drink vouchers",
        "Generally the area is nice very picturesque",
        "The beach is sad, especially when the tide is out, again, a pity the Balinese don't feel moved to treat their environment more protectively, unfortunately too much litter",
        "The food is bland, sadly so with wonderful fresh ingredients and spices this was disappointing",
        "Excellent 8 nights at the Hotel with the staff service being the reason this is a particularly ideal place to stay",
        "Everything is on hand and the pool and beach were great",
        "Very friendly, a nice place to recharge",

        "Pools, sun, friendly staff, good company",
        "what more could you ask for?",
        "Taxis are also dirt cheap so you can travel to neighbouring Kuta or Seminyak for a change of scene/cheap meal",
        "Things to look out for:",
        "No need to tip unless you experience exceptional service (although customary to tip porters for bag handling and housekeeping)",
        "* If you need a complaint handled effectively you may be waiting a while",
        "But if you have an issue you may just need to grin and bear it",
        "Breakfast is well-stocked with options for everyone and I highly recommend booking an option that includes this",
        "This is the main reason for not allocating a full 5 stars",
        "Not a whole lot to do if you are looking for cultural experiences but nice place to lay on the beach/pool and relax",
        "It was a family friendly place, that made for a very relaxing holiday",
        "Some sort of paging system might be of help here",

        "Its a beautiful walk",
        "However on the beach there are locals trying to sell you bali items (ei: sarongs, shells, tourist attraction services) - they can be a annoying especially if you want to relax",
        "Such a People Friendly Resort",
        "This was our second visit and have had great times on both occasions",
        "Nothing is too much bother for the staff, from the management to the ground staff",

        "Have Stayed here twice now and the rooms are really nice and theres always squirrels on the balcony when you wake up",

        "The food delicious and at breakfast it is a monumental array of food from all customers no matter where they lived what ever was desired was in front of you and each day you can taste food to see what it is and how it tastes seen so much food put out for mulitnational travellers",
        "My 2 week stay was like living in paradise",
        "If you are looking for a place to relax, your in the right place here",
        "Every wish is graciously taken care of",
        "The location is also really nice, with a big white sand beach, where you can take a bath or have a nice dinner",
        "The most beautiful garden in all Nusa Dua specially when you do a tour with the Garden Manager! An other fantastic experience was the Fruit Carving with an experienced Chef that above all is a true artist",
        "This was our second visit to the Resort and an 8 night package",
        "Look forward to experiencing the new bar/ eating area that is currently under construction",
        "Beautiful beach and staff, great facilities",
        "Although the dining at the resorts restaurants is of exceptional quality, you will be paying a premium cost",
        "Very friendly staff and a beautiful, peaceful setting",
        "The breakfast buffet was huge and everything was so tasty! the guest room was a great size and very comfortable!",
        "Pool area is nice too but a slide for the kids should be added to increase the fun",
        "One of our reason to choose this hotel was the Raja Balinese resturant which offer halal food for Muslims and we wanted to try the Balinese food that is halal",
        "All needs were catered for",
        "We would very interested in hearing of any deals you have available in the future",

        "a couple of other tips - if you want a taxi, don't get it from the hotel, just walk out of the front gates and you will have your pick and can negotiate a price before getting in",

        "He made my boys time there so much fun",
        "They don't advertise so make sure you ask",
        "My only gripe was the price of some of the food was pricey, especially the theme nights when there is a few of us to pay for and the room service was always cold at least 2 of the dishes which I think they should be made aware of as you are still paying top $$ for it",
        "Very tranquil",
        "Our only complaint about the room would be that the bathroom vanity is too small, the comfort of the bed more than compensated for this",
        "My husband & I recently stayed here for 7days in a Palace suite this was an amazing room the amenities top Notch, and the resort it self has so much to offer there is so many choices for dining they even have stall holders come in of an evening so you can even shop without going anywhere else",

        "Its a shame when remembering a holiday that was in most parts so pleasurable , that the first night when a Free flow drinks option was on offer with dinner that the lasting memory was having Houdini as our drinks waiter , this one act was a mistake by the staff ,an otherwise helpful friendly and informed staff has been criticized by his disappearing act",
        "Whilst being a gated community away from the frenetic life of Bali itself, it had many of the characteristics that reflect Balinese culture, far more so than the adjacent hotels",
        "Our room was immaculate and nothing was too much trouble from bringing us some ice or requesting an extra towel",

        "What a beautiful hotel! At the same time we were here, our daughter was staying at a #1 hotel in Legian",
        "Please, don't let these guys slip through the corporate fingers",
        "So, if our message is any way ambiguous! What else can I say? Its in walking distance of a Bali Central and another number of resorts - all of them offer a variety of dining experience that we didn't have the need to try",
        "Wonderful stay! We experienced everything and more at Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa! Our package blew us away with more extras than expected, the staff were always prompt in assisting us, the facilities were great - didn't have to leave the resort if we didn't want to, it had everything!",

        "Everything about the Premier room was above my expectation, from the bed to the shower facilities",

        "Beautiful gardens and beach in easy reach",
        "Finally took that long awaited break, excited to lap up luxury and get absolutely spoilt",
        "First of all, nusa dua is at least 40 minutes from anywhere that is worth going to",
        "If you want to be stuck At the hotel and have no interest in sight seeing or shopping/dining then this is the place for you",
        "Further more, staying in nusa dua is synonymous with \"filthy rich\" so they charge you triple the price to get a ride into civilisation, and try to discourage you from using a meter taxi (so that you don't find out what it ACTULALLY would cost to get to seminyak, for example, where you will pay only $8 for a delicious meal, compared to $25 for an edible meal, at best, at the resort)",

        "You then need to fill a glass with milk (at one drip per second) to take to your table to enable you to get some sugar on before the milk",
        "All explained several times but they only do as instrucred, no common sense is allowed",
        "This really is a great place for little ones, sand shallow pools and Gecko club really good",
        "About the location: Free shuttle bus to Bali Collection on the hour, nice supermarket an Frangipani restaurant was excellent, but this is more international than Balinese",
        "Now these guys not only have great food but drop you back at the hotel too",
        "I have to say, it was everything you could expect and more",
        "See you soon",
        "You need to have a rack to hang wet bathers and hooks in the bathrooms to hang things on",
        "Great facilities",
        "this is trip number 21",
        "NO HAWKERS allowed and everyone we passed was definitely in relaxed holiday mode",

        "Thank you and we look forward to returning next year",
        "And you're probably better off there as well in terms of quality!",
        "For the young more adventurous people like us, I suggest to enjoy the pool and room and get out as soon as you're thinking about doing or eating something :-)",
        "Would have given 5 out of 5 if not for this",
        "Definately will return in future",

        "You wont be disappointed",
        "This was my first time in Bali",
        "The sea was warm and shallow to swim in but did have a fair bit of seaweed as you ventured out",

        "This was a great day and would definitely ask for Kadek",
        "each and every employee was very helpful and friendly",
        "If you want to holiday at a resort where staff make you feel part of the family in tropical paradise settings",

        "However, we did as always enjoy our stay and the weather was perfect during the 2 weeks",

        "This was disappointing and needs to be improved",
        "Amazing value",
        "It has it's own section of beach which is decked out with beach chairs, the only draw back is that everyone reserves them with towels so unless you get in early you miss out",
        "The beach is good when it is high tide but during low tide there is no chance to swim",

        "Look nowhere else!",
        "Complementry massages were very good, thank you Prisma! Great family friendly hotel, very clean and felt safe",
        "The rooms although not the most modern are clean and well maintained and serviced",
        "That said, my wife and i enjoyed our stay here",
        "Nusa Dua has all these hotels by the beach and be rest assured you will not be required to step outside your hotel other than to jump into the water",
        "Make sure you do some adventure activity while in Nusa Dua",
        "Lots of activities to keep you entertained",
        "Very relaxing, massage and spa facilities excellent; food and service excellent",
        "A beautiful, relaxing holiday and I can't wait to return",
        "Nothing was too much trouble for any of your wonderful staff",
        "We have just returned from our stay with you, we enjoyed every minute, it was excellent, the staff were wonderful, always so very happy ,giving you that wonderful magical Bail holiday feeling",
        "The most beautiful resort,amazing layout,wonderful activities",
        "All staff very helpful",
        "Wonderful a Beautiful Hotel",
        "The menu was always same everyday, a variety might best for guests that stayed for a week like me",
        "Once that was resolved there was not one thing that could be faulted",
        "After 3 attempts to move us (first, to a smoking room where we were told to just open the windows, second to a room that was 1/2 the size of the one we were initially given, and much to small for 3 of us, and finally, after fully packing, they attempted to move my daughter and her family to a room close to us, that was again, too small for them)",
        "In the morning you can attend different sports activities such as yoga, outdoors",
        "The variety at the breakfast buffet was amazing, more than enough to keep you going until dinner",
        "Breakfast service very good",
        "Very kind staff",
        "Amazing highlight",
        "All good restaurants and great location and facilities",
        "We needed to do laundry and the prices were sky high, so we took our clothes out to a local laundry service that cost 1/10th of the price",
        "Recommended for a relaxing stay",
        "The room was decorated in a Balinese style which appealed to us at the time of booking as we wanted to stay in a room that reflected bali rather than a more modern type of hotel room that you see anywhere in the world",
        "Saying that it had every modern convenience you could wish for",
        "The Palace club itself is a wonderful concept and I highly recommend you splash out and try it for yourself",
        "The staff are out of this world and will go to any length to make sure your every need is cared for",
        "I say cared for because you truly feel that they genuinely do want to give you the best Bali experience ever",
        "Definitely go back :)",
        "so our supposed pleasant stay ended with dismay",
        "make sure to confirm the benefit that comes with your room otherwise you'll end up paying for or denied your benefits",
        "It was a bit disappointing in the end, we had to wait for a while for check-in, the food wasn't that great, the service at the restaurants was poor (not enough staff to serve all the guests), not enough pool chairs and everybody seems to come very early in the morning to book the chairs yet it says that you can not pre-booked pool chair on the sign",
        "but in terms of choice, you don't have the variety IMHO",
        "There is a shuttle bus to a shopping centre, however its only a short walk and the way the bus picks up and drops off at every hotel, by walking you can nearly beat it to the shopping centre on some occasions",
        "only 3 choices rather than packets of the Kelloggs variety packs you normally get in good hotels",
        "There were also lots of fresh juices, meats, fruit and yoghurt",
        "Plus as you can walk down the beach path to other hotels, you are only a short walk away from lots of other restaurants, some better / cheaper than this hotels, some not",
        "Spa & beach area: There's a Spa adjacent to the hotel, we never used this so can't comment on it",
        "The is a bit of a rush of sunbeds between 11am - 2pm so sometimes you can end up on the beach without one",
        "Easy to walk up the beach to other (and cheaper) restaurants",
        "transport, attractions to see etc",
        "They told us about the WIFI throughout the hotel which costs to use in your room or is free in the lobby where you can also use the hotels desktop computers",
        "so no issues with asking for anything",
        "Misc: Be warned that when you get off the flight and before collecting your luggage you have to pay $35 each for a enrty VISA and then queue for about hour through customs",
        "Nearly EVERYWHERE in Bali you can haggle for the cost",
        "i think the sellers half expect it so always quote you a price double what they expect, knowing you will haggle some money off",
        "Everywhere in Bali, you will get locals trying to sell you things",
        "A quite \"No Thanks\" usually suffices and you are left alone",
        "You are handed 2 vouchers and after more advertising chatter are told to open the vouchers up and low-&-behold, you have won a FREE trip to the hotel for a 3 night stay and sometimes even a cash reward of $X",
        "Nothing is free, its all a con",
        "Being a runner the beach trail was also very handy",
        "On the beach, extensive pools, enough sun lounges, food on call everywhere, magnificent breakfasts",
        "Easy to walk up the beach to other (and cheaper) restaurants",
        "There is a shuttle bus to a shopping centre which is like a mall, but if you wanted a more Balinese shopping experience you can walk out the front of the resort and pick up a cheap taxi ride",
        "that was wonderful stay",
        "thank you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa!",
        "Great hotel, very helpful and friendly staff",
        "Pool was always clean but wish there was more lunge chairs",
        "The only thing that I would suggest to upgrade is kids club its a bit dated and there wasnt much for my kids to do there",
        "Otherwise excellent location, great price and great staff",
        "When looking for a hotel that could combine a honeymoon with relaxation, cuisine and location, there could not have been a better hotel than Nusa Dua",
        "- Once you head to the beach, be prepared for a lot of locals selling things and beach massages",
        "Negatives were price, standard rooms are a bit ordinary",
        "The drinks were over $10 for a large Bintang compared to around $3 outside the hotel - some mark up is expected but this was just too much",
        "The service offered at the Palace Club is really amazing and it is a joy to return every year to a place where everyone remembers you, welcomes you as one of the family",
        "Recommend this hotel to as anyone enjoyed our 8 night stay in the palace suite alot staff all very helpful and go out of there way for you",
        "Will definitely be back! They even let us stay an extra 4 nights at a reduced rate after our accommodation at another hotel was double booked!",
        "A good choice if you want to stay away from the hassle of crowded parts of Bali",
        "- Excellent breakfast and housekeeping",
        "- A bit high prices in the restaurants, if you compare with outside ones",
        "But that's what Nusa Dua is about: Pricey and Big",
        "One big thing for improvement: Almost all pool beds are being \"reserved\" in the morning by egoistic people that put a towel on it and go back to bed",
        "Nice restaurants (I recommend the Raja for Balinese food and the Italian for very tasty pizzas) - you can eat in front of the beach",
        "You can either lay on the private white sand beach or by the the swimming-pools while drinking cocktails",
        "Staff are very friendly and you will be able to go and visit Bali by taxi or tour",
        "Lovely pools",
        "A really nice relaxing holiday",
        "The staff knew her well and she loved to see them each day",
        "It's not an ideal location for seeing the rest of Bali, but if you're content to spend your time enjoying the resort itself you'll be very happy",
        "It was actually a little ridiculous given it was a family room and sometimes more than one person needs to stand the bathroom at once",
        "Great place to stay",
        "You have a superb stretch of beach",
        "Lovely bathroom",
        "Great staff",
        "Great rooms",
        "Great garden",
        "Great experience",
        "We manage a 5 star hotel and had to find somewhere nice for a break - this did the trick",
        "We went there as a group recently including two guests in wheelchairs and booked the accessible rooms (they have a twin share and a king as well as an interconnecting room if you are taking personal support with you",
        "This is a resort set on a huge area with gardens and monuments dotting the landscape",
        "A lovely area to have you morning tea! The food is good and so is the service",
        "The wi-fi is available in the public areas which is okay, to have the wi-fi in your room, you need to pay",
        "Unfortunately Nusa Dua isnt the place where you can walk to the main road and get something to eat",
        "Have a rest when you want and go hit the slides again",
        "Nothing was too much to ask with the staff",
        "I would recommend staying here if you want to not get hassled and bothered by anyone",
        "When you enter from the gate you will feel that you are in Bali",
        "You can get the best view during the day and night",
        "The hotel comfort is fine",
        "The resort is perfectly fine if you are expecting the usual Bali fare; but definitely NOT a 4 and a half star experience",
        "regardless of whether you are dressed or not",
        "lovely squirrels and ducks",
        "But the staff were their usual extremely friendly and obliging selves and room service was prompt",
        "The staff were so friendly and made our stay memorable! The general manager even introduced himself on our first day",
        "Looking forward to returning in the near future",
        "every were die empoyens hat time for a litel talking end there were very intresting",
        "The walk in front of the hotel down to Bali Collection is nice and shady and you get to have a look at the other hotels",
        "Unfortunately, I booked a room that was not as nice as the first time around",
        "No wishes were left open",
        "Rooms very clean",
        "Very well maintained",
        "Bad experience",
        "The bed was really comfortable, storage plentiful and the marble bathroom a good size (although I did think it was the one thing that was looking a little tired and dated)",
        "The style and ambiance of the hotel is perfect - yes, there are newer, more glamorous and more luxurious resorts around, but if you want to feel like you are in Bali, then this is a great choice",
        "Authentic Bali great staff",
        "A couple of minor issues with the wifi in our room but all in all Avery relaxing stay",
        "I recommend everyone try the Balinese cuisine at Raja's Restaurant, delicious",
        "negative: finshing in the room could be little bit better, bottle of water in room had mold on the plastic, airco always on when you're not in the room",
        "Overall better than expected and will probably return for 1 month stay next year",
        "If you can do the Palace Club its terrific",
        "This is our 2nd visit to Nusa Dua Hotel Beach and Spa- the first for my daughter's wedding in 2009, and this last visit for a famiy holiday",
        "Overall, a wonderful trip",
        "Everything was perfect! Quiet and clean rooms, helpful employees, clean beach, delicious dishes",
        "Amazing buffet breakfast, friendly staff, comfortable and clean room",
        "Beach lovely",
        "Overall a really relaxing stay",
        "this is one of the best 5 star hotels in Nusa Dua",
        "thank you so much",
        "it's rally worth every cent you sent for it",
        "friendly staff",
        "Very clean and Food great",
        "Great service and great value",
        "Nusa Dua beach hotel is a fantastic and impressive complex",
        "We quickly found several other very good eateries along the beach so this was not a huge problem for us",
        "Never felt crowded and the other guests were all very respectful and quiet",
        "Staff lovely",
        "Awesome food, service, drinks and hospitality",
        "Beautiful location and grounds",
        "Great service and nice rooms",
        "Would definitely return and recommend to anyone",
        "this was a holiday of a lifetime",
        "pools and sports facilities, table tennis, tennis, gym just great",
        "thank you all for a great holiday, will be back as soon as possible!",
        "What a fabulous experience we all had! The 8 day Indulgence package was absolutely brilliant and we used everything in our voucher and then some! The staff were wonderful and attentive",
        "You will hear trolleys being pushed across the pathways from about 7 am as others have suggested, but this was no problem for us",
        "Walking the beach front in both directions you'll notice the newer, 'western' 5 star places are cold and sterile by comparison and lack the tradition, warmth and character that abounds at this resort",
        "I have paid considerably more for buffets in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane that were nowhere near the quality on offer here",
        "Last tip, if like me you enjoy copious amounts of wine, south east asia is not for you, especially Bali",
        "If you buy it at Bali Collection supermarket, you will pay over $20 still",
        "5 to 5 start luxury in what is sadly a gated community bereft of Balinese culture save for this authentic resort",
        "Staff very friendly and accommodating",
        "We attended 3 buffets during our stay as part of the package so sawa good crossection on what was on offer",
        "inside and out gave us the feeling of really being somewhere different",
        "The rooms are nice but $300 per night for the most basic room is fairly outrageous, especially when you're expected to pay extra for wifi in the room",
        "The food from the restaurants is also woefully overpriced for what you get",
        "staff were extremely freindly,food was fantastic and palace club room had everything you could want",
        "Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be returning",
        "the only thing i would recommend better aircon and a coffee machine I hate creamer",
        "Staff/people very friendly",
        "Thank you",
        "My stay at your hotel was very nice except for a few things",
        "Only way to avoid this was to have breakfast quite early",
        "Lots of hotels in the area are austere and very grandiose",
        "We had a Palace Suite, and all the extras that went with that luxury accommodation - afternoon tea, cocktails, free meals and massages - well worth the upgrade",
        "The club staff are exceptional, whether it is making sure you are happy with your food to making restaurant bookings and arranging transport nothing is a problem",
        "This was the first big hotel built in Nusa Dua and has spacious beautifully landscaped grounds, setting it aside from many of the more modern establishments",
        "Service was a little slow at times, but it's not too bad when you are lying around the pool relaxing",
        "Further an absolute perfect location",
        "You have to get down poolside early to reserve your deck chair, or you'll miss out",
        "To say we enjoyed our stay is an understatement",
        "The staff were all attentive, helpful & extremely friendly - that goes for the security guards at the front gate as well !!!",
        "The Theme nights on Monday,Wednesday & Firday nights are not to be missed as you are entertained with some balinese culture while you dine",
        "Bali Collection has a host of yummy restuatrants to cater to all tastebuds, wherever you came from",
        "Be advised however, some of the prices they quote on the menus are EX-TAX - that is you need to add approximately 21% tax on top",
        "Be warned though, you will be",
        "For example, I requested a stroller, and that was delivered to my room in 5 minutes",
        "Howeever i have a special mention all the female staff were welcoming and all their service was with a smile",
        "Good was very perfect",
        "What a lovely hotel",
        "Mr Keni and Mr Ronda are excellent drivers)",
        "This is a wonderful place to relax in and chill out",
        "To get a pool side seat under an umbrella you need to be there early though",
        "Friendly staff, beautiful location, great facilities",
        "5 year old really enjoyed",
        "The room had a double bed and a pair of bunks - pretty close quarters for a family of four, but still better than two rooms when you have young kids",
        "The breakfast was probably the most extensive I have come across in my time and that is really saying something",
        "We also tried to book into their spa, and found that you really needed to make a reservation 2-3 days in advance to get a suitable time, keep that in mind",
        "Just give me a final price I have to pay please, especially when that's the drinks list, the menu, the charge to take out a bike or have a spa treatment",
        "Very sorry to have to leave",
        "A beautiful blend of traditional Bali and luxury, away from the madding crowd! This resort is well-designed and we enjoyed our stay immensely",
        "Breakfast buffet was excellent but getting a table is a little difficult if you go late for breakfast",
        "An incredibly warm welcome, excellent service throughout and all staff are incredibly helpful and attentive",
        "Incredible atmosphere and very relaxing ambience",
        "The staff are exceptional and dining is a fantastic experience",
        "What a fantastic location",
        "You can do as much or as little as you desire in this 5+ star resort, and its sensational surroundings",
        "I am happy to report we had wonderful cooperation from all hotel staff and our stay was a very pleasant experience",
        "Staff friendly and helpful",
        "Beautiful surrounds",
        "Hotel staff friendly and helpful",
        "Good food and service",
        "Our whole family love staying here",
        "was just great",
        "On a Luxury Escapes holiday and really enjoyed our stay",
        "Very friendly staff",
        "com has so helpfull made great trip suggestions very honest and reliable, change money at resort or bail collection money changes in shops outside resort gates are very shifty and will take you down if they can all in all great place [ quite not like kuta or otherside of island], pools, food,people, service,location all very good would stay again for sure",
        "I stayed At this property during my Business visit to Bali only for One Day and my experience is overall very good and best thing is the SPA of the property",
        "We thought our Luxury Escape package was great value but advertised as a 2 adults and 2 children deal you need to supply a bed for each person",
        "Great shopping, restaurants and pampering",
        "We also ate at an Italian just outside of the Resort Gates, this was really lovely too",
        "We spent 9 nights here last year in a Palace Club Suite and loved it, so when it came to booking somewhere special for our 20th Wedding Anniversary - this was our first choice",
        "We booked a Palace Club Suite again but was upgraded to the Agung Suite - this suite has the best views in the entire hotel with a verandah that wraps around 3 sides",
        "Just beautiful",
        "there is no free wifi in room (you have to pay for it)",
        "first night great, last night, very average!",
        "As an older couple who spend more time in the room than most people this was bitterly disappointing for us",
        "There are a lot of beautiful hotels in Nusa Dua, this would be last on my list",
        "Have just come back from an 8 night stay, on a cudo voucher, and could definitely have stayed longer! Travelled with a 3yo and 9 month old",
        "Was a little tight, so wouldn't go smaller if you can avoid it",
        "this was the most relaxing holiday in a beautiful part of Bali will go back again",
        "The hotel is big enough that you can see people when you want to",
        "And hide away when you need some down time",
        "Staff were really helpful and made our stay great",
        "Would highly recommend them if you are planning to stay in a big group",
        "No complaints otherwise and would highly recommend a stay here",
        "Thankyou for a lovely stay",
        "Having stayed 3 times previously, all of which where enjoyed greatly , our recent stay the whole experience was an improvement on the previous",
        "After an initial stumble with our previously promised room not being available , the Hotel quickly arranged for a suitable replacement room that was above expectations",
        "From that point the service throughout was faultless , with the staff going out of their way to ensure that anything and everything that could be done was done in a cheery no fuss style",
        "The casual Balinese theme of this Hotel makes for a relaxing and stress free stay",
        "If you want a holiday where all you do is relax by the pool or get massages at the spa , go for a lovely stroll along the beach or some light shopping this is the best place to go",
        "Will be going back again for sure",
        "I think this should be included as with most hotels these days",
        "This was disappointing and not acceptable for a hotel of 5 Star rating",
        "A very relaxing place",
        "Kid friendly",
        "nothing is too much trouble and the facilities a delight",
        "I stayed at the palace room and all the staff was very friendly and will help you with everything you need",
        "The lounge that serves breakfast offers a good range of food that are cooked to perfection",
        "anything you need will always be helped by the warm and friendly staff",
        "The hotel is located in a great location on the beach at Nusa Dua which is great if you want to swim in the ocean or walk along the beach",
        "The walk to Bali Collection shopping complex along the beach is about 8-10 minutes or you can use the shuttel bus provided",
        "The hotel grounds are beautiful and the hotel buildings although ageing have been well maintained",
        "The noise from the service staff trolleys was a little annoying although this was mainly during the day but at times was noticeable during the evening or early hours of the morning",
        "Expect to bargain on all prices and expect rudeness",
        "This hotel was booked for me by a conference organizer that invited me as a speaker",
        "The palace up grade was nice for a couple of days but to be honest for the extra cost you can live without it",
        "We decided to have breakfast in the main restaurant as the coffee was hot and you got a full cup, you also had a much larger choice",
        "A great hotel - felt safe, secure and happy at all times during our stay",
        "A fabulous relaxing holiday",
        "The highlight of our stay was The Palace Club and their wonderful staff",
        "During our stay we also visited the Galleria mall which is a short walk away, or you may use the free hotel transport if you wish",
        "We would happily recommend this hotel - but only if you are looking for an indulgent experience in a heavenly setting!",
        "The staff are very friendly and do everything you ask promptly and with a smile",
        "We loved how quiet, calm and peaceful the beachfront was",
        "Air conditioning worked well",
        "As noted by myself and other TA reviewers, hospitality and service is a key ingredient of this hotel",
        "If you're seeking a relaxing Balinese ambience, with 5 star facilities, then you'll be very pleased",
        "As it was my 50th birthday we thought it would be nice to finish with a little bit of luxury and this certainly fit the bill",
        "First impressions count, and from the spectacular lobby on arrival and the fantastic service we received from the check in staff who didn't bat an eyelid about us being a couple of hours early and checked us in immediately, everything went smoothly",
        "The resort itself is huge and has lots of places to hang out and enjoy a drink or relax",
        "The beach is lovely, much nicer than Seminyak where we stayed last year, and there are only few local touts who are happy to move along when you say no thanks",
        "If you head out to the path and turn right towards the park with the big statue it's a 10 minute walk to the Nusa Dua Shopping and entertainment complex, here you'll find lots of shops, including a chemist, department store and a large number of restaurants if you'd like somewhere a bit cheaper then the hotel to eat",
        "If you do a lot of shopping the going rate for a cab back to the hotel is 30000 rupiah (approx AU$3)",
        "We deiced to eat in both nights and the food and service was excellent - although not cheap, prices were comparable with what you'd pay back in Australia",
        "If you're looking for an authentic Balinese experience you're probably not going to find it here, but if you want a bit of resort luxury then this is for you",
        "A lovely, specious and grand hotel",
        "The pool bar was great and busy but not where you can't get a bed",
        "Just breathtaking",
        "Really great hotel and enjoyable stay",
        "The room was great, everything worked and was really clean, yet lots of reviews comment on the cleanliness we found this was not an issue",
        "Ok so you could get cheaper drinks outside the hotel and people do comment on that well coming from perth where a cocktail can cost up to $25 we found everything reasonable !",
        "The staff are friendly and usually as helpful as they can be, with all members from concierge to maintenance wishing you well as you pass by",
        "This was our 1st stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "Whilst there are many great things about this hotel there are also aspects that aren't so good",
        "Being late in the evening the last thing I wanted to do was to get dressed and go to the front desk",
        "We had just come from a 3 star hotel in Candidasa that was by far superior in cleanliness",
        "So that was night 1",
        "There was no way that you would sit outside on your balcony and enjoy the views of the lovely gardens",
        "We then went to the front desk to ask if these things could be addressed",
        "Such a shame that our luxury escape holiday started so badly and really had lost a nights sleep and then half a day in all the toing and froing",
        "Indeed all the staff were friendly and pleasant",
        "Although this room was not musty, there were a lot of little things that needed fixing",
        "And the breakfast buffet has everything you could wish for! Very highly recommended!",
        "The staff employed at the hotel go out of their way to meet your every need",
        "Excellent resort",
        "several pools with great amenities, lots of greenery everywhere with blooming flowers is a great experience",
        "The resort grounds as you drive in are huge and the foyer is quite fancy, not to mention the stunning view that awaits you",
        "Being conscious of security I do remember walking out of the hotel at night and seeing a huge crowd of staff in the dark waiting for a ride home and this did feel a little eery",
        "I would absolutely recommend Nusa Dua Resort & Spa but would like to note that it is pricey considering you are in Bali",
        "And if you want to see the real Bali, I would suggest you visit Kuta, Denpasar or the rice fields",
        "It is still 30-45mins to Kuta/Seminyak so for those who want to be in the centre of town, this may not be suitable",
        "Firstly security in and out of the property ha been increased, which makes you feel secure straight away",
        "Stay at the hotel and enjoy all the facilities and discover the spa which features wonderful treatments, it has a lap pool, female and male heated jacuzzis, gym which is a little oasis tucked away from the main hotel area or just enjoy the main pool and pool bar for happy hour each day",
        "Hope I can return for another significant birthday in 10 years time!",
        "Everything including bedding and towels smells damp",
        "The ambiance of the resort architecture is just so very Bali, not global corporate style of the now many neighbouring properties that you may find in any location",
        "This being the first resort in the Nusa Dua area it has the best stretch of beach and extensive grounds where you can find tranquility in many uncrowded areas",
        "The inclusions are superb quality and great value",
        "See you next year Palace Club, sorry to haven taken so long to have come back to our second home",
        "Comfortable and very quiet",
        "What made my stay so special was the staff and management",
        "Allover a real treat",
        "only in lobby has free wifi, if you need to use wifi in your room, you need to pay",
        "A special thanks to Supadmi, she is a very friendly and efficient lady",
        "This was by far the best",
        "If you want to relax and be treated like kings and queens then you must try this hotel",
        "What makes it special are the staff and management that bend over backwards to help you",
        "With 4 great restaurants and a good room service menu you cant go wrong",
        "beautiful and big pool",
        "Comfortable room",
        "Very good legong dinner",
        "You can not miss it",
        "Nice staff",
        "Never feels bored and always full of excitement",
        "This was the first hotel built at Nusa Dua and is truly the most authentic hotel in the area",
        "Special thanks to all the staff, particularly Gin, Nona, Sugi, Rasni, Anik, Wardana, who made our stay a memorable one",
        "Wonderful spa facilities",
        "It was interesting to learn he also managed another hotel we have stayed in at Tuban and it is clear he bought his skills to this hotel as nothing could be faulted",
        "Many thanks for a wonderful holiday and we hope to return soon",
        "Even when we had a medical problem, the support from the internal doctor and hotel management team was great",
        "Beach and swimming pools are close together which is great if you travel with children",
        "In the garden around the hotel you can spend a lot of time and amaze about the diverse plants, trees, flowers and animals",
        "A bit of walking backwards and forwards entailed",
        "Took ages to get anything cold",
        "It costs about 80,000 to get to Kuta Square area and about 100,000 if you are coming back from Legian area",
        "Especially if you use the tollway",
        "But you have to pay an extra 10,000 rupiah for the toll",
        "All in all a lovely relaxing holiday",
        "Buffet breakfast had everything you needed",
        "No way is this a five star hotel",
        "Hotel staff are patently unhelpful when you ask about getting a regular taxi",
        "Just a perfect place to relax",
        "Great Facilities",
        "Very warm staff",
        "You can rent a bike to add adventure to your vacation! The best place to rent a bike is Kutta beach area",
        "Not everything can be left out to this excuse",
        "Beach is ok, again nothing extraordinary - though that's not hotel's fault",
        "Overall, a good hotel but nothing extraordinary",
        "The complimentary toiletries were not good quality",
        "Good value and very entertaining",
        "We also did a sunset dinner at Jimbaran Bay (Sea side Cafe) which was excellent and the cost of the taxi to/from the hotel was included in the price of the meal (this was organised through Baliku tours, not the hotel",
        "You can take the free bus to the shopping centre and then negotiate a deal with one of taxis that are lined up there",
        "This is one of the original and only remaining traditional Balinese style designed resort",
        "The hotel has tremendous charm and you can soak in the Balinese architecture and culture",
        "The breakfast is just awesome, the beach front nice and many recliners to sit and sunbathe on",
        "even the restaurants quite nice",
        "We love that the resort is 30yrs old and has the authentic Bali feel, if we wanted the Gold Coast luxury resort we would have just gone to one, but when you come to Bali don't you want to feel like your in Bali",
        "Almost pristine in fact!",
        "Beauty at every turn, from the magnificent Balinese palace style design to the decor, room interiors, divine gardens, pools, restaurants and beachfront to the smilingly helpful staff who made our stay so beautiful",
        "An incredibly generous package",
        "The hotel itself is stunningly beautiful, it is as close as you could get to living in an ancient Balinese temple-palace",
        "Thank you Palace Club for making my stay so memorable",
        "Even with the major refurbishment undertaken in the last few years it has maintained its charm stylishly but not opulently",
        "These are things to consider in the heat and humidity that comes with a Balinese holiday",
        "You never feel on top of other guests",
        "Constructive criticism: Being picky now but",
        "Sad to have to go to that extent but unfortunately some people are not as considerate as others and this is not a hotel fault but a human one",
        "MUST stress though, that these are not details that would deter one from returning to this relaxing and charming hotel",
        "Lovely toiletries",
        "Look out for three roving musicians we affectionately dubbed 'The Three Amigos' - they will sing you your favourite song in three part harmony and are really friendly, talented guys",
        "Their salmon gravlax was impressive too",
        "Unfortunately I picked up a virus half way through our stay",
        "Also, once you get to Nusa Dua there's not much to do except be in the resort",
        "Which is what we wanted but we have since moved on to Sanur where you can go for a walk and see",
        "You know",
        "So if you live in Australia and want to chill by a pool drinking cocktails out of a giant coconut, look out for the Luxury Escape deal",
        "Great value",
        "If you want more Bali life, hang here for a few days and maybe check out Ubud",
        "The gardens are manicured to an inch and the trees and plantings are all mature giving the place an nice shady feel",
        "The restaurants are handy and a good mix of food albeit on the high price side as are the drinks but we were happy to stay around there are drink and eat but you make your choice",
        "Staff were very friendly and acceptable for this hotel (probably 4 star now) and made you feel welcomed",
        "The roses had a very nice message attached",
        "A nice touch",
        "Everything was continually topped up so you were never short of any foods",
        "Probably one of the overall best breakfast bars for quality and variety you would find",
        "This was the perfect place to unwind",
        "Not much to think about each day except what to eat from the extensive breakfast buffet, to which pool to lounge at",
        "Same applies for the bed sheets; they were substituted only if you ask for it! You can even see the spider nets in some parts of the room",
        "This is not the purpose of relaxed holidays!",
        "the prices were OK, the problem is the add taxes that brings the final price 40% more expensive of what is written",
        "The SPA area is the highlight of the hotel in our opinion, in there we could relax with the wonderful swimming pool where you can actually swim, not very crowd",
        "The only note that we would like to add, is that maybe it will be a good idea to restrict kids into this area, since this is supposed to be a relaxing area, and not a playground!",
        "Going for a swim in the see was just not good, you were swimming next to you will see plastic bags, plastic bottles, etc",
        "Wow, this place is visually VERY pleasing and authentic",
        "This can be quite pricey (pretty much the same as AUS prices)",
        "Local restaurants were within walking distance (about 10 minutes away) if you preferred to eat out",
        "The resort is spotless and you have a feeling of safety and a calming atmosphere",
        "All the stresses you carry with your luggage will be replaced with peace, harmony and complete wellbeing",
        "You are isolated here, a number of hotels within walking distance",
        "Everything is basically a car trip to reach unless you have general fitness and don't mind the extreme heat",
        "Safety is excellent, security car checks going and leaving the hotels and boom gates that are manned",
        "For the price this is a great place in Nusa Dua",
        "This is my 4th time to this resort always staying in the Palace club suites",
        "I was last here June last year and this was on offer then",
        "This would be much easier for all by offering a small buffet, like nice cheese, fruit and maybe one hot dish instead of offering the small plates",
        "Overall you won't be disappointed here",
        "Truly lovely resort",
        "They are helpful, but seemed to lacked training and coaching for that 5 star touch, especially comparing to our experience visiting Laguna hotel and Sofitel, the service gap is particular apparent in Front Office and F&B",
        "Its service down fall again, is most probably not notable for a relaxed family holiday, and if 5 star experience it not what is in one's mind",
        "Friendly cheerful",
        "This is like a two stage facility",
        "You walk in the front door and you would think you have walked into David Jones or Myers",
        "Everything is beautiful and quite expensive BUT out the back door is a different story",
        "You will find a pharmacy, restaurants, a general store and other shops",
        "These are not as cheap as the village so I would suggest you buy only the necessities at the Bali collection and then head to the village",
        "Don't be afraid on your first day to acquaint yourself with the people up there as prices are not as high as you would expect in Nusa Dua",
        "For those that are using the deals",
        "Once I produced the original offer, the staff were happy to provide what was stated",
        "This was very disappointing",
        "This is our fourth trip to Bali and the first time staying at Nusa Dua",
        "This is only half true",
        "We liked the Rajas Balinese cuisine - the one with authentic Balinese food and the Chess restaurant - it's at the beach and you can have dinner and lunch under the beach umbrellas",
        "Overall, the best thing about the resort are all the people running it",
        "They are so nice and amiable - you have no choice but to instantly like them",
        "The location is great, the facilities a bit dated but well maintained, grounds beautiful, staff friendly but generally very poorly trained, the food very close to horrible and WAY over priced for what you get",
        "Beach set up is great but I found the beach vendors persistent and annoying, always interrupting a nap to try to sell you a sarong or kite",
        "Very friendly and helpful staff, great service, always smiling",
        "More upmarket food and a little more pretentious but nonetheless mouth-watering food and immaculate service!",
        "Lovely spa, excellent sports and gym centre and games area",
        "This is a lovely hotel with beautiful grounds and beach",
        "You get your beach sellers but they are monitored by the hotel and they are not allowed to interrupt your R & R time unless you call them over",
        "Not wet, not too hot, just perfect days",
        "Bathrooms definitely need to be renovated",
        "Not many options to eat if you are vegetarian",
        "Restaurants and pool terrific",
        "The area is large, so many luscious garden surroundings ahh feel so natural along with a duck pond, squirrels, kids area and swimming pools to tranquil yourself",
        "If you get bored you can perch in at the private beach area with a white sandy beach and crystal clear water",
        "Breakfast is magnificent, you can roll whatever you want there at Wedang Jahe Restaurant",
        "They offer many great quality food to make up your energy, and the omelette was magical, the cheese was so sticky and melting like pizza when you pull it off, kudos!",
        "Since they have a large property area, you wont get enough strolling around this hotel, so many activities, biking, Balinese dancer, diving lesson, fruit carving etc, you can hop pool to pool to experience swimming quality with your friends n family",
        "But too bad the hotel is too faraway from mini-market/convenient store, you need a shuttle bus or taxi to gain access nearby",
        "Great facility, friendly staff, and sensational location",
        "Bought package through luxury escapes, royal suite upgrade, worth the little extra you pay",
        "Beach clean and quite, pool area excellent, Chess restaurant service and food fantastic",
        "The administration staff cannot sort any problems with accounts at all and checkout was drawn out and exhausting, The wait staff are mostly very obliging - especially the staff in the executive club, you all deserve a big pat on the back!!!! Some management staff (executive chef) need to be a little for considerate of guests when holding loud conversations whilst traditional performances are staged on theme nights, we found this disrespectful to the Balinese culture and rude to paying guests",
        "Very Quiet location, with paved walking path meandering along the beach for kilometres, excellent clean quiet beach directly opposite the resort, lots of shade even on the beach, large well kept lawns and gardens",
        "yum, staff friendly and very accommodating",
        "Wonderful staff",
        "What a beautiful hotel",
        "Staff were realy friendly and nothing was to much trouble for them",
        "Also hairdryer was not the best",
        "In all had a great relaxing holiday here",
        "Although this was our 3rd and 4th trips to Bali, this was our first to Nusa Dua and with the wheelchair",
        "The breakfast is amazing, we had no trouble getting a lounge by the pool (although I expect this would be very hard during holiday periods), and everything was very clean",
        "We had a spa treatment - the lap pool by the spa area is lovely and a nice place if you are looking for something quieter than the main pool area",
        "Smoking is prohibited in public areas however this is not enforced at all",
        "We have stayed in two rooms at 3rd floor (quite far from the beach) We found a solid 5 star resort where all the basic needs are there",
        "Interior and exterior design with wooden Bali theme makes you feel that you are in Bali",
        "We recommend this r escort for families, if you don't have kids and fancy for night life, pick a hotel from Kuta",
        "One Comp photo per room is a good gesture from the hotel (keep in mind that camera that they use is Canon 500D only)",
        "Excellent breakfast especially all the tropical fruits that tasted so delicious",
        "If you are looking for somewhere different to eat you can eat at any other resorts along the beach",
        "Nusa Dua area is 5* reservation, so around is no real life, you should go/drive out to see/try Balinese life",
        "For few nights for pure relax its a good place but not for long stay",
        "Pretty rooms, with some minor flaws that can be quickly remedied by good housekeeping",
        "Premier Room, the premier rooms are beautiful, contrast to the modern design of the deluxe, the premier rooms have a deeper sense of Balanise charm",
        "It is worth the extra buck if you're looking for a very authentic Balanise experience in terms of accommodations",
        "Some pointers though, the walls are paper thin, as you can hear the birds chirping outside, you will also hear the baby crying in the hallway or your noisy neighbors in the adjoining room",
        "Not very clean",
        "This can again be remedied by proper housekeeping the floor can be cleaned then vacuumed after",
        "Overall though this is a beautiful room to stay in",
        "Over all the hotel is a beautiful gem with some need for fixing",
        "I had booked into a Palace Club room and the spacious room was a perfect blend of Balinese charm and 21st Century",
        "This is a stunning suite with separate cloakroom, living room, bedroom and bathroom with a balcony complete with two sun loungers",
        "After just a few hours the staff - I hate that word - all know your name, how you take your coffee and your preferred sunset tipple",
        "I was also impressed by the very speedy and effective repair of the in-room electricity that was cutting out intermittently",
        "That being said, the hotel is amazing",
        "- Beach was lovely and you could swim at the beach!",
        "- Amazing sports facilities and air conditioned gym",
        "- The best banana smoothies!",
        "'Huge' is an understatement",
        "Rooms were a little old, you can definitely feel it as well as see it",
        "If you want a hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is the place to go",
        "Here's a little tip, let them know beforehand if you'd like them to avoid 'certain areas' like tender chest area (you feel me, ladies?)",
        "That's just wasteful",
        "Also, please behave yourselves",
        "The staff never stop smiling",
        "We had a small glitch with our room when we got here, but this was quickly sorted out, no problem what so ever",
        "Everything about this place is just wonderful",
        "It is peaceful, beautiful and it makes you feel serene",
        "This was very spacious and comfort living",
        "This was all table service",
        "The pool is huge with lots of places to sit with a pool bar that had extraordinary service",
        "You can pick anything off their menu!!",
        "I had seen a few, let's say average, reviews regarding the resort, so you can say I was somewhat 'open mided' about what my wife and I were in for, what made us book was basically an online deal that seemed to good to pass up",
        "The way we were treated was out of this world, the most caring, attentive people you could ask for",
        "Realistically, we know it is their job and we all put on a smile for our customers but you could genuinely feel their warmth",
        "Koi fish in the ponds while you have your breakfast, the bigh kingfisher hungrily watching them and the squirrels scurrying along your balcony, everything just fit together",
        "Great location so you can travel effortlessly to the different hotspots and back",
        "It was worth paying the extra, because you get a more personalised experience",
        "The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of the noise level",
        "It would have been good to receive warning about this so we could have visited when the building work had finished",
        "There is a large water monitor lizard that you get to see close up",
        "We were made to feel especially welcome, as I'm sure everyone is made to feel",
        "A big luxurious resort complex which offers everything that you expect from a 5 star establishment - no complaint at all! The Deluxe rooms were a bit small and worn-out, although the website claims that they were recently refurbished (a bit hard to believe, if you ask me)",
        "The resort is a good choice if you are after a luxury escape",
        "We travelled all the way from London which took us about 15 hours and then to arrive at a five star hotel without even a mention of a drink is unacceptable",
        "I am pretty uncoordinated but i'm pretty sure there's something going on here",
        ") Bathrooms are so small, you smash your elbows when you try to wipe your bum",
        "We do still have 3 more days here so hopefully things take a turn for the better",
        "The staff are widely experienced compared to the new and modern hotels who are still striving to achieve what now comes naturally to the Nusa Dua Beach",
        "The hotel has many terraces where you can eat and a gorgeous restaurant for breakfast and dinner",
        "The stuff is nice and helpful",
        "The hotel has a free shuttle bus to and from Bali Collection where you can find many shops and restaurants",
        "Rooms a good size",
        "We obtained a voucher in Australia for our accommodation that included breakfasts, some dinners with traditional dance shows, spa treatments & an assortment of other thoughtful & genuinely given (no hidden surprises)",
        "Nusa Dua is a gated community of elite hotels & resorts & you are treated like royalty where ever you go",
        "There is security on the gates but it is only a short walk to the local village market where you can barter your but off for amazing bargains",
        "The beach has chairs & you can get table service for food & drinks where ever you are on the property",
        "The staff could not do enough to help regardless of where they worked or what you needed",
        "You do need to book in advance though as there is a good chance they cannot fit you in on the day you choose if you do not",
        "Food: the food was excellent in all restaurants & the breakfast was delicious & beyond belief, almost anything you can imagine is on offer & then some! it was my partners FAVOURITE part of each day",
        "this DID NOT happen! We were bitterly disappointed in KUTA, the people were rude, pushy & threatening",
        "3 females on holiday together and we all voted this the most attentive and relaxing resort ever",
        "The staff really friendly",
        "Felt the warm fm the staff",
        "There's lots of bugs coz lots of tropical trees surrounding the lower floors",
        "the coach cost around 60US for a few hours, the driver will wait for you while you shop, remember to bargain while u shop there",
        "Best of the house was the kitchen, fantastic gourmet, excellent chef",
        "The hotel staf should maybe speak a little bit better English",
        "Overall we enjoyed our stay",
        "Since you are staying at a beach make sure you ask for a room close to the sea",
        "don't assume you will get a sea view",
        "There are lots of activities inside and outside the resort",
        "Breakfast is sumptuous and there are shows inside the hotel premises you can enjoy",
        "However its a typical laid back easy going resort where you can enjoy a nice spa, time by the beach and relish some lovely food at their multiple restaurants serving Indo, Japanese, Italian and western cuisines",
        "Do be careful if you plan to visit the temples",
        "Get a room that opens to the lawn and pool",
        "This is more a review of my experience rather than the hotel itself",
        "Thank you again NDBH for your kindness",
        "The time you enter, you are entertained with wet damp scented towels, gives you so much rejuvenated",
        "The real feel of Bali you can sense, with the aroma around you is so relaxing",
        "Its is just amazing",
        "On arrival, we were greeted with a bday cake, roses and champagne, this set the scene for our glorious stay",
        "There is a complimentary shuttle which transports you to Bali collection should you wish to eat outside",
        "Overall an excellent stay",
        "You really feel a piece of Bali in this hotel with its Ballinese wooden structures and amazing ceilings in the bedrooms",
        "Standard rooms or Palace Club rooms (and 1 mansion if you have 10+ people and want your own pool)",
        "If you eat at each food event you pretty much dont need dinner",
        "The safe was large so you can fit any size laptop or personal items in it",
        "You pretty much dont have to leave the resort",
        "With our package came 12 spa treatments and the spa is lovely the pool down in the spa is quiet and peaceful if you want to get away from the children in the main pool",
        "The hotel is very well run, staff are so efficient and amazingly enough nothing is too much trouble",
        "Very good gym",
        "It is worth the money you pay for in this place",
        "Well maybe for some people, you need to leave your phone home while you go to Bali",
        "The food at the hotel was very good but if you stayed for longer than a week you might get a little bored with it",
        "Nice breakfast buffet",
        "Nusa Dua area itself is nice with good walking/running possibilities along beack walkway between the hotel gardens & the beach itself, running several kilometers along the beach to both directions",
        "You MUST try the spa there!! it was so nice and relaxing!! I wish I chose the longer session instead of the one or 1",
        "This is our second trip to Bali",
        "You will be waiting a long time to be served food and drinks",
        "That night there were only 3 tables with customers and they could not get anything right",
        "There is a shuttle bus that will take you to Bali collections every hour",
        "Also if you want a taxi, do not get one from the hotel",
        "They charge you double as the hotel gets their cut",
        "Walk down towards the gates and you will find many drivers waiting to be called by the hotel",
        "They will approach you and ask if you would like a driver",
        "Given the proximity and ease of access to offsite restaurants, spas and drivers the mark ups on resort are a little high but overall a very relaxing stay",
        "If you do decide to book this hotel, then do yourself a favour and spend the little extra on the Palace Club options, the service at breakfast is superb, there's no lining up at egg stations, everything is made fresh and brough to your table",
        "The view from the breakfast area is beautiful, ponds, fountains, fish, geese, squirells all doing their thing while you sit back and plan the day ahead",
        "think about putting a little bit of shelter over the patio area, if it rains (like it did for 2 days) there's no where to sit without getting soaked, you cant even have the sliding doors open without having to mop up the floor",
        "They gave us complimentary champagne and decorated our room and bathroom with rose petals when they got to know that its our honeymoon",
        "Evening entertainement very poor",

        "Management very \"hands-on\" and go out of way to make stay enjoyable",
        "Wifi is available only in the common areas, not in the rooms, but if you have a room at the ground floor and step out in the garden, then you connect",
        "The beach is not so good (swimming only with high tide), and if you are staying in Bali you might want to consider staying in a less touristic area",
        "com however our stay has been disappointing",
        "And there is no distraction in the hotel apart from outdoor entertainments",
        "It's somewhat dated and you do notice immediately",
        "It's absolutely spotless, the staff are super friendly, the food is great (not amazing but great) and well you pretty much get what you would expect for the price you will probably pay",
        "-wifi is free in community areas (pool, bar etc) but is $11AUD per DAY if you want it in your room",
        "Instead I walked two minutes to the beach (go to beach and turn left, walk a minute and ladies will flock - you should pay between 50,000-80,000 rupiah for an hour - $5",

        "This was a hotel with great Balinese character, with authentic temples and lovely landscaped grounds",
        "Why in the world do they offer free wi-fi in all public areas of the hotel whereas you will be charged 10 USD a day for using internet in your room? By doing so they only annoy their customers unnecessarily",
        "Of course, being the first hotel on the Nusa Dua stretch (the property's been around for 30 years), it does not offer the same experience as the newer chains that occupy the same stretch now",
        "Plus, you'd have a beautiful stretch of beach at your doorstep",

        "You do not have much choices when come to lunch and dinner time at the hotel, i was feeling grateful that the hotel was giving 4 x rp50,000 voucher, but you can only spent each rp50,000 voucher for every rp200,000 you have spent",
        "Great location if you want a more private beach and away from the popular crowded beach areas",
        "This was my first time in Nusa Dua and in a segregated area of resorts the Beach Hotel and Spa did not disappoint The property was great and had every thing that you would want",
        "Even though Nusa Dua one of many resorts in a gated area, read the tourist info because the concierge will not direct you anywhere but the hotel you stay in",

        "Had great stay",
        "Resort close to shopping centre and many restaurants that are cheaper ( and in many cases better ) than the Resorts offering",
        "Beautiful hotel, beautiful beach, many amenities, great for families or couples, breakfast buffet is phenomenal, spa and gym facilities are very clean and nice, friendly staff, multiple restaurants on site with a variety of foods, you never have to leave the resort if you don't want to",
        "Will be left with beautiful memories",
        "If you're budget conscious, call yourself a bluebird taxi instead of using their fixed rate at the concierge to take you to the airport",
        "So whether it's a wedding venue or just for a holiday, you will not be disappointed with your stay at this hotel and will have a memorable stay",
        "Kind regards to all staff at the hotel x",
        "Just awesome!",
        "\" EVERYTHING was perfect! I'm going to miss the coffee and juice at sunrise, the amazing buffet breakfast, the pools, the beach with tall cold beer, the lobby bar with Eti, dinner with a show or a special dinner at Raja's Balinese Restaurant, and of course a cool clean room with a very comfortable bed!!!!!!",

        "The room itself was impressive and clean with nice traditional decorations",
        "Rooms themselves were okay - not great",
        "If you don't have a room facing the interior pool area the view is uninspiring and the generator from the adjacent resort make sitting on the balcony unpleasant due to the loud hum coming from the generator",
        "Everyone was very helpful and nice",
        "However, culturally it was pretty much nothing and you are pretty isolated from Bali in general",
        "Just know what you want before you go",
        "Last note: If you want to be connected to the internet during your stay then look someplace else",
        "No wifi (paid or otherwise) except for the immediate lobby area which gets overloaded very easily during breakfast because since there is no wifi anywhere else everyone tries to do their surfing at the same time in the morning",
        "There are ethernet jacks in the rooms for paid access -- too bad hardly anyone uses ethernet to connect to the internet anymore",
        "A sun lounge beside the pool does need to be nabbed earlyish but there are lots of shaded lounges just a few metres away on the beach",
        "One thing all Nusa Dua hotels offer is the opportunity to stroll hand in hand along clean beaches, on two-person wide footpaths that are flat and well-lit at night",
        "That's a bonus compared to the up, down, trip single- file scenario in other busy tourist destinations",
        "The worst - getting good Balinese / Indonesian food for dinners, and of course, byo wine",
        "BEST IDEA EVER!!",

        "The choices are the same every day but there are SO many choices that you can have something different every single day",
        "The best thing about staying in this resort area within Nusa Dua is the peace and quiet compared to Kuta/Legian",

        "The only things that are good is a great beach, breakfast and location",
        "But everything else is frustrating",

        "The island depends on tourists for their economy and its dog eat dog and when walking taxi drivers always stop and ask to take you where you are going",

        "We had a few issues that very well might be unique to my wife and I; you be the judge",
        "There were few people at the mall and the shops mainly junk although there was a supermarket, so for any better shopping or nightlife a taxi at about $8 each way would be required to Kuta",
        "(We paid $175 plus $20 for a room upgrade that included breakfast (excellent), service and taxes",
        "And you have to walk for 10 mins or so to get to any restaurants or stores outside the hotels",
        "It would be a good choice if you would like to stay in a large-scale hotel with a lot of other guests with very limited interaction (or negotiation) with local people",
        "All the therapists do an excellent job but the quality of the Spa facilities could be improved",
        "Everything was perfect, highly recommend",
        "They have awesome schedule and parents wouldn't need to worry a bit! Even if you would like to leave your kids over lunch or dinner, they're ready to help you out! So yes, it's a worth place to go again! :)",
        "you could serve yourself",
        "We ate at most of the hotel restaurants which were much as you would expect at a resort hotel, a bit expensive and the food fairly bland",
        "The exception was Raja's where we had two extremely nice meals with dishes that gave the taste buds a bit of a treat",
        "I'm seventeen years old (female) and this hotel is fit for all ages , I would like to start off with the fitness centre although many of you come for relaxation if you are coming with your children in the centre it has a variety of activities such as : tennis , squash , bicycles , gym ,spa and a swimming pool etc - The staff in this centre are incredible , in the gym I had a staff member personally train me and motivate and encourage me to keep going , also before you go into the gym they show you how each machine works",
        "He was so nice and very friendly",
        "Having a week stayed in here! A traditional property room designed comes with modern F & B outlets by the pool or beach",
        "Overall; a great experience! You are surely don't feel bored to spent a week here!",
        "30 AM, loved the omelettes specially made to order while you watch",
        "Lots of shady spots with cushioned beach lounges were available, great large clean beach towels",
        "Haven't stayed here since 2005",
        "Because the property is so huge can take you 10 minutes to walk to your room from reception, therefore not a joke when your key card doesn't work and you have to trek back to reception (happened more than once - a day)",
        "Wireless Internet access in the room was terrible, probably because of the sprawling nature of the complex, but still strange this hasn't been addressed given the hotels proximity to the conference centre and volume of business travelers and conference attendees",
        "Generally good hotel, probably would stay here again, but value for money could be seriously enhanced with a few small adjustments by management that would not cost much, such as Internet access",
        "Rooms well overdue a facelift",
        "great swimming pool and and beach",
        "Business trip for a convention at the Westin right next door",
        "Not particularly modern either, but with right room you can have a great view",
        "Not worth the $ you spend for at the end",
        "I would expect that Palace Rooms should include free airport transfers but is not available this is included in most elite resorts , so really should be included here",
        "the hotel give you so called Nusa Dua money, which is very annoying to use, we did not present ours to a hotel restaurant for the discount at the time, so were refused to use them later on when we asked the cashier in the palace club room, this should be easier to work out",
        "It has absolutely every thing you need for a perfect holiday",
        "At the palace club you truly are made to feel like royalty",
        "Because of the sheer size of this hotel there are so many places to hide if you want peace and quite",
        "My only suggestion would be more variety in the cocktail food",
        "The Bali collection shopping centre is a 10 minute walk (or 2 minutes in free shuttle) with supermarket, pharmacy, department store, massage etc so you can get anything you need without any hassle",
        "It is nothing like Seminyak or Kuta/Legian so if you are looking for loads of shopping, restaurants or party time its probably not the place for you",
        "We enjoyed the breakfast as plenty of choice so you can have a different style breakfast everyday",
        "Very special!",
        "Very frustrating when trying to do some work!",
        "We both felt like VIP guests as our every need was catered for",
        "We hope some day to return as this was our first but not our last holiday in Bali",
        "This is a very nice Hotel, less busy than many in the Nusa Dua Resort Area and is very reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel",
        "If you like spa, this hotel has one of the best spa in Bali and has been top rated several times",
        "There's also a sort of traditional amphitheatre with weekly balinese dance performances (and a delicious buffet)",
        "A great tip is most of the local restaurants will transport you to and from their restaurant for free, you just need to call them",
        "Love the hotel, beach is clean and peaceful, staff are friendly, room service is good",
        "Note though that this is a resort and not near any real shopping or dining accomodations outside of the complex",
        "There is a tiny street area about 1/2 mile away that had a couple restaurants and a couple shops but nothing much",
        "Still this hotel was very good",
        "Great staff and accomodations",
        "You can make yourself a cup of cappuccino or latte, you name it, just by a touch!! Amazing!",
        "This resort definately has the WOW factor",
        "This is full of restaurants - cheap cheap, lots of shopping, spa treatment shops, money exchange booths, entertainment",
        "The Resort: Absolutely beautiful - breathtaking",
        "The most beautiful kept gardens to stroll around, there is a great walking path/cycle path along the beach, that will take you to all the other resorts in Nusa Dua",
        "They also have a tour desk there, if you wish to book tours with them",
        "You can take a taxi ride into Kuta (main shopping complex), short taxi ride of 40 mins or so",
        "If you want to use it in your room or around the resort, you have to pay for it",
        "That is my only negative thing about the resort",
        "Will definitely be returning!",
        "From the room to the pool to the breakfast, everything was perfect",
        "Everything you could want in a hotel, right on the beach, two very large swimming pools, bars, restaurants, spa and gym, rooms to cater for everyone",

        "I had some spa treatments which were heaven thats the only way one could describe them",
        "Overall my trip was good",
        "There are some workers who clean up whatever is washed on shore",
        "But i recommend not swimming",
        "overall good facilities but",
        "This hotel caters mainly to the corporate client and big functions and holiday makers have to endure the big dinners and entertainment that goes with that",
        "that is all great if you are part of the party but not so great if you try and get a 4 year old to sleep",
        "that's ridiculous",
        "There is a bus that takes you there for free however not that reliable",
        "10 PM, a hotel staff knocked our door while we were still packing and said \"Why you haven't leave yet, sir?\" I was very disappointed, I knew that we should check out at 12 PM, but it is very rude to said like that to guests, come on it only 10 minutes past the suggested check out time and the hotel was not crowded at that time",
        "Overall a solid 8/10",
        "There are five excellent choices to dine and the outlook from the beach is very romantic if that is what you are after",
        "I was close to plenty of resteraunts so you can eat in the hotel resteraunts or go out",

        "The photos on the site are what you see",
        "The rooms were not that clean need to be improved, and sheets yellow and marked",
        "Staff in club lounge would hel with anything you needed",

        "however you can either wonder down to Bali Collection or the main road",
        "There are a number of restaurants and places to have a drink so no need to go outside the hotel if you don't want to, great service",
        "Overall a good hotel with plenty of things to do",
        "so no romantic nightswim",
        "However, if you're going to relax on the beach and have no worries about food and accommodation then you can't do much better than this",
        "You can walk along the seafront between them and use the different restaurants and bars at each",
        "Very nice",
        "The sea itself has quite a lot of seaweed growing on the bed so it's not a crystal clear blue lagoon but at high-tide you hardly notice",
        "This is unique to indonesia and this depicts the yin-yang theory of life",
        "lovely cocktails",
        "hospitable staff",

        "Hotel grounds, pool, and beach area very relaxing",
        "You don't wanna go to Bali to be on the internet",
        "But I think this is an important thing these days",
        "There's so many options that you could spend a week there",
        "This is a perfect place to rest",
        "We got the palace club room which is very recommendable since you get to stay at the palace club, where the breakfast is much better, and you get evening tea and cocktail our included in room price",
        "Beautiful and prestine with a lot of Balinese culture infused, clean and comfortable with many picture worthy spots",
        "As a hotel guest, my only suggestion would be to ask for a room that doesn't face the construction (looks like a new resort being built)",
        "For the hotel, my one suggestion would be to offer free water with purchased meals",

        "30am) so you get first pickings",
        "I recommend trying \"Burgers on the Beach\" which you can get for lunch from the Chess Restaurant",
        "It's very cheap and you get a good helping of burger and wedges",
        "You also get to choose your own salads and sauces",
        "You do get approached by people selling things on the beach a lot though, you just have to be able to say \"no thanks\", often more than once",
        "This is the same wherever you go outside of the hotel",
        "Just make sure you're firm in saying no and you'll be fine",
        "What an amazing trip",
        "Everything about our stay at the Nusa Dua went above our expectations and by check out we were already planning our next visit",
        "However this did not cause any discomfort while taking nice naps after lunch on the calm and peaceful beach",
        "You sat down and a few minutes later you had smoker move in on both sides",
        "Very friendly and caring",
        "Normally when you visit a particular country, you want to indulge in the local cuisine",
        "We booked an all day tour through the hotel and our guide, Putu, was such a sweet and friendly guy",
        "Would definitely recommend!",
        "If you stay more days you really get sick of it,",
        "Cons: I m beach person but the beach of nusa dua strip was not of high standard",
        "Beautiful surroundings",
        "You can take a walk along the path behind the hotel to enjoy nusa dua beach and some of its beach bars",
        "Great service, good food and nice rooms",
        "The breakfast is good and you can find everything from pancakes to fried rice and omelettes made-to-order",
        "The lap pool/health centre/spa area is nice and secluded if you want to get away",
        "The middle of the day was the only time you had a chance of being able to use it",
        "If you had a lap top you could plug in to a connection in your room but you had to pay extra to use it - approx $5 for 1 hour",
        "In a 5 star resort I believe that this should be included in the price",
        "They had a business centre but again the connection was terribly slow and you had the inconvenience of having to go to the business centre to use the internet",
        "Nusa Dua is a great location if you want to be away from the shopping/tourists/nightlife of Kuta or Seminyak",
        "Only negative thing I can say is hotel (& other 5 star hotels in the area) are in a secluded gated area",
        "Great for safety & security but you have to leave the resort by taxi to go anywhere including convenience store or any shops",
        "EVERYTHING about this place is exceptional!",
        "The hotel is set amongst other 5 star hotels built 1 next to the other with no bounding wall separating them, which is great, you are able to walk down the pathway visiting other hotels, perhaps trying dinner at different places",
        "The pool area gets packed quickly, so getting there early is a good tip, while the afternoon seems to fizzle out, more pool chairs become available",
        "definitely would return!",
        "There is a timetable in the gym area that shows all the activities for the week - many of them free of charge",
        "Thanks to Tripadvisor, we found this excelent hotel",
        "we had stayed from feb 7 to 11, felt it was quite less, you need at least 7 days out of which at least 2 full days in this beautiful resort",
        "Every day they had some aqua aerobics you could join in with if you wished",
        "They love children and make you very welcome",
        "as you come into the property, the candi bentar (split gates) together with the Balinese architecture make this feel a little more in touch with its location than the other resorts along Nusa Dua",
        "From the concierge to the cleaner, from guest relations to the bar person",
        "The hotel ambience makes you feel that you are in Bali",
        "Okay so a little more expensive with regards to food and drinks compared to Seminyak/Kuta but you are staying at a hotel in a luxury area of Nusa Dua",
        "Recommend that you dont overthink everything",
        "You are in Bali off course",
        "The pools were big, the beach private, and because it was off-peak season, there were lots of space for everyone",
        "Breakfast, although had a wide variety, was pretty much they same fare everyday so you started to get bored of it after a while",
        "I think that our problems mentioned above would have been solved much more smoothly if the staff could or would just tell us what was happening",
        "Highlight is the private beach where you can catch the sunrise",
        "well, mission pretty much accomplished",
        "The facility itself boasts a few different restaurants, two swimming pools, morning yoga sessions, gym, kids playgroups, function rooms etc etc",
        "The beach is a 1-3 minute walk from the hotel depending on which part of hotel you are staying at",
        "Two huge and beautiful swimming pools - one with a swim up bar and the other with pool volley ball and a sand beach entry",
        "You pay extra for all of these services",
        "Plus the air conditioner worked very well",
        "The Balinese people and their lovely smiles and friendly and relaxed nature just makes you relaxed too",
        "The hotel was immaculately kept and it was quiet and serene everywhere you went",
        "You really did feel like you were staying in Paradise at this lovely hotel",
        "Nusa Dua would be the place to stay if you want to just chill out and avoid the hussle bussle of Kuta",
        "The breakfast was really good, you'll be spoiled for choices",
        "If you want to eat outside the hotel, you can head out to Bali Collection is probably around 10-15 mins walk from the hotel, else you can also order a taxi to get out of the Nusa Dua complex",
        "Safe, clean, friendly atmosphere",
        "There were a lot of choices in breakfast and the taste was quite good",
        "We stay here for 2 nights in deluxe room,very nice and clean hotel let you feel relaxing",
        "It's a nice hotel for families and couples, if you are interested on shopping of cause better to stay at kuta or seminyak ,and if you are looking for a quite holidays,would recommend",
        "Thank you NDBHS, you really made our stay in Bali a memorable one!",
        "I was told to return after breakfast, he would see what he could do",
        "He was trying hard to be pleasant, but not succeeding very well",
        "The room was spacious and for the most part very clean except for a few small cobwebs on the bed head what looked like a small amount of mould in the shower cubicle",
        "It did get to be annoying the amount of people that would constantly approach you to buy local wares (anything from plactic necklaces to sarrongs) while you were trying to relax or sell you another trip snorkeling, surely there has to be a better way of doing this? I also found it a little odd that I couldnt borrow or hire a pair of fins from the hotel and was told I needed to walk down to another resort laguna and that it would then be $10 an hour just to use them??? So hense I went snokeling sans fins",
        "Overall though the resort was excellent I'd give it 8/10 and I would definiatley go back, I cant say the same about the rest of Bali though, Kuta for one is simply filthy and you get swarmed upon by people trying to sell you something or simply to rip you off",
        "So the qestion is would I go back and it the answer is a qualified yes however I would just stay in the resort and that would be fine!",
        "Friendly staff Breakfast very nice",
        "Swimming pools lovely and clean",
        "The afternoon tea is quite generous and you would pay the australian costing for this",
        "i thought this was quite odd",
        "So very helpful",
        "Highly recommend this hotel and would Love to return anytime",
        "the gym was small but enough, the recreational place that supposedly has games for kids was nt even working & they only had 2games",
        "+ good price",
        "+ nice location",
        "+ beautiful pool",
        "I recently stayed at Mulia Bali - a spanking new facility with a ultra premium price tag and it was a terrible experience( you may see my review on it elsewhere in this site)",
        "Our first stay at this very traditional and beautiful Balinese Resort (and wont be our last) and loved every minute",
        "The service from all the staff was exceptional and best wished to all the trainees who have been doing work placement at the Hotel - you have great role models! Loved the invitation to attend the General Manager's Cocktail Party - great to meet the GM - Urs and the amazing and very talented Aussie Chef - Geoff Clarke",
        "Everything was prepared immaculately for us; from 3 towels, 3 beds, 3 umbrellas, 3 of everything",
        "The only bad thing was the constant rainy weather",
        "The hotel is right by the beach so if you don't feel like pool time, go straight ahead and fool around in the ocean",
        "Awesome and delicious breakfast buffet too!",
        "in the spa - imagine getting a balinese massage listening to jingle bells ??!!! the staff are good but this is the real oddity",
        "overall a very happy stay and the strong ratings they get on tripadvisor are well justified",
        "We checked out the Laguna also in Nusa Dua and plan to stay there next as this looks like another level higher again",
        "What a fantastic experience",
        "But everything turns quiet at 9pm",
        "The resort itself is nice, with multiple food options",
        "The big thing is Nusa Dua is a little sleepy, and more equipped for families with little kids",
        "We went for our honeymoon and felt Seminyak is a way better area if you want upscale dining and a cooler beach atmosphere",
        "Very child friendly and maybe not perfect for a single couple in the high season if you want to have a quiet holiday",
        "Not brand new but very well kept",
        "The bathroom effectively floods every time you take a shower",
        "Great seafood",
        "You'll like it",
        "Especially if you're travelling with the family",
        "This is a stunning resort",
        "Everything about this hotel is5 star,the staff, service,facility's etc,a few people complaining about the price of taxis from the hotel,yes there is a big difference in price,but consider this, you walk outside of the hotel save a couple of dollars and you may be getting into an uninsured and or unlicensed taxi, your staying in a 5 star hotel,why would you bother",
        "read more reviews if you wish, but you will love it here",
        "I think my heading itself explains everything",
        "Overall a very good experience",
        "The food was excellent in all the restuarants in the hotel, prices are a little high but no more than what you pay in other 5 * hotels",
        "The breakfast was great with just about everything that you could think of",
        "Had a wonderful experience here",

        "Great and safe location, attentive staff, and awesome grounds",
        "Beautiful hotel!",
        "Room was wonderful, welcome flowers and champagne but overlooking the construction site next door that operated for 16 hours a day and spot lights 24hrs",
        "Amazing holiday, super friendly staff",
        "Most beautiful lobby, you instantly feel relaxed upon arrival",
        "- agonisingly slow internet, available only in the lobby - surely this is unacceptable in 2012",
        "- big breakfast buffet with more unnatural food - eg we tried guessing what juices we were drinking but it was so tasteless and artificial couldn't get close",
        "com and there was a good deal",
        "The decor and general feel of the room is nice and ambient rather than standard decor from a chain hotel",
        "Although it is spacious enough and kept me in a clean condition, the shower screen is tiny and as a result a lot of water ends up splashing on the other side of the bathroom",
        "Becomes a pain after a while no matter how much you try to control the water pressure",
        "Other facilities were good as you would expect from a 5 star resort - games room, business centre etc",
        "The housekeeping and staff in general were very friendly wherever you walked",
        "Naturally, you do get a little bit bored after a few days but then isnt this the case with most breakfast buffets?",

        "Couldnt pick any faults, they were all very friendly",
        "Nusa Dua itself is a bit far off from other areas such as Kuta or Seminyak, but the area is very well kept, secure, clean and very nice",

        "The food was lovely and you will find a wide range of food served for breakfast to suit everyone",
        "The service of the staff made our stay even more comfortable",
        "and in case you missed it - recommended! This is by any measure a great property and a great experience",
        "This was our 25th wedding anniversary",
        "You can walk along the beach in the evening to see what the other hotels are serving for dinner if you want a change or instead of going to Bali Collection",
        "Bali Collection is overpriced for shopping and you do not want to go into Kuta",
        "Repeat, you do not want to go into Kuta, it will spoil whatever beautiful Bali that is still preserved",
        "Admittedly it is expensive, but nothing you wouldn't expect for a 4-5 star hotel in such a wonderful location",
        "The Hotel grows on you the longer you stay",
        "This is a richly constructed marvel",
        "Very nice breakfast buffet, very nice rooms, very nice pool area",
        "we had a serious issue which I will not get into, but this is NOT a hotel to trust your kids to",

        "But the room configuration doesn't really allow for much room to do that",

        "Everyone of the staff were courteous, helpful, friendly and kind",
        "Our room was clean and modern with everything you could need for your holiday",
        "bars and restaurants were more expensive than elsewhere in Bali but I guess you pay for the wonderful surroundings and location",
        "Each room has a balcony, so you can sit out and ejoy the beauty of the balinese landscaped gardens",
        "you get wayu beef, so tender & juicy, among other meats which you cook on your own BBQ stove",
        "There was a balcony with chairs and tables that look out to the sea and pool area",
        "The beach is private and had very little bother from the small amount of authorized local sellers",
        "There is a walk along the beach front past all the large hotels and if you follow this a little further there is a small shopping / restaurant area (Bali Collection), where you can buy the usual tourist souvenirs as well as a couple of supermarkets for snack etc",
        "Lots to choose from and always plenty available",
        "having stayed in such hotel you expect a high quality internet service not a free wifi in the lobby! the staff are not so warm compared to the other one which we stayed in Bali and not that much friendly",

        "We booked a deluxe room for 4, which was 2 adjoining rooms on the 2nd floor that overlooked the main pool & had views of the beach",
        "cheers alan mcgill and of course the lovely Marie",
        "We have just returned from a 15 night stay at The Nusa Dua Beach Resort & Spa and if you're looking for somewhere to 'recharge the batteries' - look no further! All the staff were friendly & helpful",
        "The best thing regarding this hotel was their excellent service ,everything you asked was in your hand in few minutes",
        "The vendors kept their distance unless you beckoned them to approach",
        "the best place to relax and unwind",
        "This hotel has a few hundred rooms so it's a mega resort that attracts crowds and serves mediocre food",
        "There are a lot of young people here; I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for some R&R",
        "Nusa Dua Beach Hotel provides all you need for an all-inclusive vacation in the high-end resort area of Nusa Dua",
        "One that was unique was a pool for kids that had a sloping side with sand",
        "If you looking for personal attention you will not find this here as this is a big resort with lots of rooms",
        "Food is a bit pricey but what do you expect from a 5 star resort",
        "I had my hair done at the hair salon and this was way overpriced",
        "An upgrade needed on the beach recliners - pretty old and uncomfortable and more pool chairs needed as if you are not early you unfortunately have to wait",
        "First time in Bali and weren't sure what to expect",
        "With all this you don't really need lunch or dinner",
        "The guy making the omelettes did a great job with all the demand too! Lovely breakfast room with a great view",
        "00 AUS if you don't want to wait for the next shuttle",
        "It's probably close to perfect if you are looking for a nice peaceful place to stay and relax, enjoy the beach, pool, spa etc",
        "The restaurants on site are so-so, not quite up to the level that could be expected, especially the one closest to the beach serving rather bland (and expensive) poorly prepared curries and other things",
        "While there we did a one day trip to Ubud (temples, monkey park, handicrafts, market), which was really nice, and should be considered a \"must\"",
        "right on the beach, close to markets and Bali collection shopping centre has a shuttle that goes on the hour and drops you at Bali collection and then brings you back",
        "You can also walk to the shops along the beach",
        "Great food something for everyone",
        "Brilliant rooms, good location and very nice setting",
        "Excellent western food too (club, pizza)",
        "Located near the Convention Centre and tuck within the same compound of the other 5 star hotel such as Westin Resort, Sheraton Laguna, you can expect a good time to rest and relax at the beach",
        "You can also book hotel taxi for an 8 hour session to bring you around",
        "Remember you can bargain too!",
        "This is an excellent hotel, rooms are lovely, clean and modern & pools/gardens are beautiful! I was there with my wife and 2",
        "First time in Bali and decided to look for a minimum 4* hotel that covers return airport transfers, daily breakfast and preferably with spa services",
        "All guests were allowed to use the spa's pools, jaccuzi and steam room services, even though if you did not book any services with the spa",
        "Nusa Dua location would not be ideal if you are looking to have something to do at night",
        "This is an excellent hotel, rooms are lovely, clean and modern & pools/gardens are beautiful! I was traveling with my partner and my parents - All of us were very happy with quality of service and surrounds",
        "My only complaint of the hotel is that internet use in the business lounge was very expensive - Suggest you take laptop/phone to use free WIFI in lobby",
        "The air conditioner didn't work, the shower was clogged which flooded the bathroom and you got the opportunity to have your own 'pool' in your room, wading in lord knows what",
        "So after contacting the management 2 more times no resolution was forthcoming, sorry, that's not quite true",
        "Made Karmadanarta for giving us the best customer service experience ever, if you want to have the best customer service experience, don't be hesitate to choose Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa, for a great place to stay in Bali!!",
        "The hotel is in good condition, I believe it has had a refurb a few years ago, and I couldn't spot a thing wrong with it",
        "Everything was clean and tidy, and the layout worked well - from the pool areas to the very open and spacious foyer with the fish ponds that were a great hit with our kids (concierge have food that you can use to feed the fish with)",
        "On the back of the swim up bar is the kids pool, which means you can be having a beer watching your little ones!",
        "almost everything that can make a great stay",
        "only thing which disappointed was the size of the pool",
        "The Kids Club ladies there were so attentive and smiling all the time and trying to make her feel comfortable, not to mention other kids to play together",
        "The only think this hotel need to look out is their staff attentiveness,they're nice but sometime they aren't quite helpful in term of helping hands so might need to address them for help",
        "Everything seemed clean and well-maintained",
        "Expensive, but I guess you would expect that at a resort",
        "There's a great path along the beach that runs along all of the resorts",
        "All-in-all, I'd recommend this place, unless you know you'd rather have a more modern environment with less character",
        "This is a great hotel for couples wanting to have some lovely time together",
        "If you are a fan of large beach resorts you'll probably love this place",
        "It is one of many in a strip along the beach and you are well insulated from the real Bali",
        "We had a lovely time at the hotel but was slightly put out at the cost of a taxi when you use the hotel task service",
        "The well groomed gardens, the clean beach, spotless pools, not to mention the breakfast in the morning, what an excellent way to begin a day !",
        "Very friendly/welcoming staff, endless facilities and beautiful grounds",
        "The service was also wonderful; all the hotel employees were very very nice and profesional",
        "(If you go there, you should try the pool bar cocktails",
        "While Nusa Dua is a bit of a resort enclave, the hotel building itself still had a lovely Balinese feel to it",
        "- there are lots of activities going on",
        "- most food is very nice, and yes much more expensive as elsewhere in Bali which is logical: food quality and service is much better, you get nice tableware and you are sitting right to a clean beach",
        "Everything was going as planned",
        "Clean room, great facilities and services, friendly and knowledgeable staffs, peaceful environment and nice food",
        "We had a premier room that was closest possible room to the wedding bale and steps from the pool which was very convenient however was far away from the lobby so if you don't like walking to/from check-in, check-out and breakfast then I would request something a little closer to the lobby (although keep in mind the whole property is massive, as are a lot of the hotels in Nusa Dua so you will be walking no matter what)",
        "The main pools, no matter how many people were in and around it, never felt busy or noisy although the swim up pool bar did fill up at times (but the drinks were so delicious you can't really blame people for staying there)",
        "There is also a lot of lounges on the sand with only 1 or 2 people walking up and down selling their wares",
        "Only down fall with this place is the food and the prices for what you get",
        "amazing everything, love it and will be returning later this year!",
        "Only gripe is the excessive price of the food for quality that is actually quite average",
        "Alternatives outside the hotel need a taxi ride so you feel trapped with everything 2 to 3 times more expensive than you would expect",
        "Most people compare this to M, but this hotel is easily the overall winner especially when you wake up feeling refreshed from the newly renovated room with new bed",
        "So disappointment start when you're in the bed",
        "I know that they have done renovations but I don't think it makes the rooms an extra $86 per night, but this is only my opinion",
        "Only bad thing at hotel is winelist, no Bali wine from Hatten producer like before, with special request we could get bottle oh Jepun Rose from Raja, but otherwise at The Lobbu, Chess bar, room service palace club, only sort list of wine's which we didnt like and only one sparkiling wine option, that reduce our experience at Hotel's restaurants and bars also there wasnt problem to skip free cocktail's at Palace club because of wine selection",
        "For us this was 6th visit, difficult to tell about Hotel, faults and goods, we see place so differently, place where we know how to relax and what to get, wine issue was problem for us, but otherwise people there and also away how Hotel is leaded make this place worth to visti, all there are made for customers, if you need and ask you get and almost without asking, for children there is Gecko club, saw many times laughing, playing kids with excellent nanny's how play with them and really like job, cannot be oherwise",
        "During our trip Hotel had several big groups, 100 people's dinner, lunch, waeding, several and often sametime, we \"normal\" tourist at beach and elsewhere didnt much notice these happenigs, so very well kept and arrange, didnt disturb any activities, so smoothly that if ever need meeting and celebration service this is a place, or new weading :-)",
        "The rooms are cleaned to a very high standard by staff who seem to know when you're out of the room",
        "The restaurants at the resort were quite expensive but there are free shuttles to Bali Collection shopping complex that depart and return on the hour",
        "There are several restaurants there that are very cheap and clean",
        "There are also convenience stores for things like Bintang beer, soft drinks and water that are a fraction of the resort prices (e",
        "Always greeting you with a lively smile",
        "Perfect getaway for 3 days of relaxation",
        "very friendly",
        "Didnt have dinner at the hotel",
        "This would also apply to Nusa Dua as place as well",
        "Further, the hotel makes it hard to get away as there are no taxis or other transport at the door like you would find at places in Bali other than Nusa Dua",
        "We figured out pretty quickly that it only takes about 15 minutes to walk to Bali Collection (via the beach, which is mostly shaded along the path connecting all of the hotels) or you can catch the free shuttle (but this does not operate at lunch or dinner time!)",
        "Most of the restaurants will collect you and drop you back to your hotel for free (if you can plan this in advance or call them if you know where you want to eat)",
        "There is also a restaurant if you walk in the opposite direction to Bali Collection (from the hotel along the beach), Kendi Kuning",
        "about 10 minutes from the hotel but not as much shade if you go in the day)",
        "If you walk just past the security for the hotel there are drivers waiting who will take you anywhere you want to go",
        "If you go to Bali Collection you can get a massage for about $30AUD and if you go to the markets you can get one for about $6AUD",
        "Obviously the massage at the markets is not as lush as the one at the hotel's day spa but they are pretty good all the same, particularly if you take your own scented oil (i",
        "great pools & beach area",
        "you first have to differentiate between the hotel and the rest of the island",
        "I know for a fact that anyone that disagrees has not been to any other country in their entire life",
        "Tour Guides take you to really expensive shops for them to get a percentage of what you buy",
        "Everything is Overpriced",
        "I recommend the hotel only if you had to go there and you had no choice",
        "Been to many countries, This is defiantly the WORST EVER",
        "Also there was some construction work going on (I think from the site next door) that started at 9am",
        "This was also an annoyance when relaxing on the beach",
        "The room was very nice, simple and all you need from a hotel room",
        "Wish to be there once again",
        "You lay out in the sun, but cannot get in the water because of sea urchins",
        "Enjoyed the beach jogging path as if you don't want to walk in sand this path very pleasant to walk along",
        "Great swimming pool and loved Chess Restuarant with view of beach and food was great for a snack",
        "if i would ever come back to Bali i would not consider anything else",
        "Beware of the scammers giving away 'scratchy prize tickets'",
        "if you scratch and 'win' you will be hoaxed to a selling session of timeshare!",
        "If we venture to Nusa Dua again, this will be our choice of accommodation",
        "The Spa itself is fabulous, reasonably priced but with 5 star masseuses and an excellent choice of treatments",
        "The first thing we noticed upon arrival at the hotel was the enormous expanse of the hotel grounds",
        "Everything else was great",
        "This is an excellent gem of a resort",
        "Open and airy and you really get the feel of the place you are in",
        "During our first visit in 2010 the hotel seemed to be lacking the customer service you expect from a five star resort",
        "There was lot's of wildlife in the peacful gardens and grounds and plenty of room round both pool areas",
        "The room itself was a good size with all the ammenaties you expect from a five star",
        "Bali is changing , a new airport is being built and more western hotels appear each time you visit",
        "There are mutilple restaurants and bars, and with the Westin etc next door if you get tired of the hotel cuisine, walk for 30 seconds on the beach and try somewhere else",
        "although on the beach to the left of the hotel are a group of ladies that will offer massages on the beach",
        "The resort itself is huge",
        "Its alos a short walk to other 5 stars international hotesl and resorts located just beside ours",
        "To our left are Club Med and Conrad and to our right; westin and laguna",
        "The hotel itself has a large swimming pool that caters to different groups of users like children",
        "There is a bar in the middle of the pool as well if you may need a drink while swimming",
        "They frequently ask you by name, if they can get you anything else and are very accommodating if you are unable to enjoy the snacks during designated times",
        "These kinds of things express how warmly you are welcome",
        "Have just returned from 5 night stay",
        "Breakfast at Palace Club was simple and sufficient (much better for those of us who can't help overeating at buffet's), although we did go to the main buffet breakfast once and that was a fairly standard buffet for a good hotel",
        "Agree with other comments about Taxis so if you know precisely where you are going, ask the hotel to get you a blue cab",
        "We stayed in Nusa Dua for 6 nights we travelled from Ubud and this was the final stay in Bali",
        "I fould this really unusual and odd",
        "There are also a few massage parlours outside the hotel that offer a good massage for an hour for reasonable prices",
        "There are alot off staf standing around in the lobby area doing at times just that standing around",
        "You have to leave the hotel to see Bali even though the hotel provides everything inside you could be anywhere in the world",
        "The room - ours was the most basic - was large enough and had a balcony that overlooked a fountain! Breakfast was pretty standard, with decent food choice and quality and the occasional live music entertainment",
        "Breakfast the next morning was as it had always been with a buffet plus the choice of a cooked item; this was very good",
        "I always try to get a deluxe room on the ground floor overlooking the pool area as I find this the most convenient to everything and you can just walk off the front porch onto the lawn",
        "really you go there for the hotel and the hassle free beaches",
        "Staff make the difference, they efficiently ensure you are able to relax and have the holiday you want",
        "Pros:- The friendliest staff we have ever seen",
        "Always ready to help",
        "Good cable tv programs included",
        "Adaptors included",
        "Also, if your visit is during monsoon season, you might want to bring the complimentary umbrella in the room for your Bali collection visit",
        "This is also a good place to stock up your bottled water",
        "This hotel has the perfect location if you are looking for the beach and probably in the safest place in Bali",
        "I thought i knew what friendly staff was, but theese guys take it to the next level",
        "Are you planning to eat at the hotel you better bring a lot of money",
        "Bali Collections is definately the place to eat out in as the restaurants are quite expensive within the resort, there is a shuttle bus each hour to take you there",
        "The construction was annoying, because it was noisy and one had to take detours around the work, but that's understandable",
        "Service was very good, but I think that is more due to the culture and not the specific resort",
        "Clean and tidy, but nothing over the top spectacular",
        "However, even the \"better\" room was not great, and having stayed at about 15 different hotels all over Bali, we know you can get better value at this price point",
        "You truly know that you are in Bali throughout your stay with the various influences each way you turn",
        "Certainly not something you find from most hotels in Bali (for instance- try the Westin next door)",
        "There is a good choice of restaurant type (and price) in the resort and WIFI is FREE in the large foyer area (just ask and you will be given a code)",
        "I think one of the issues with big resorts like this is that you cannot easily see beyond the front gate",
        "So if you want another Bali food experience than your hotel, walk 5 minutes along the beach path from Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, past Club Med, to Kendi Kunning restaurant and enjoy the genuine alternative, or walk past the security gate to go to a local Nusa Dua restaurant",
        "It was exactly like the pictures had shown! stunning hotel, modern yet a balinese feel to it, helpful staff",
        "There is a market down the road from the hotel where you can buy all your souveniors and do your shopping",
        "The staff are very friendly especially \"sofar\" who is a young lady who ensured our needs were always met",
        "If you are looking for a tasteful, upmarket, value for money hotel you cant go wrong with this one! We will definitely be back!",
        "Especially with the room that is located so close to breakfast, pool, and beach",
        "There are many water sport activities based on Benoa, so you have to go to Benoa first before you do anything else",
        "What I love about this particular Nusa Dua spots (around these four hotels), you can take the glass bottom boat trip (250rb/boat/hour) off the hotel's beach provided is not during low tide",
        "They will take you not too far into the sea where you can spots lots of fishes",
        "Or you can snorkel and dive",
        "That was part of our honeymoon trip and the hotel really matched our expectations",
        "anyway we still managed to get our sleep later in the day, but some others would possibly go for a separate villa or at least an upgrade to the room (palace club or whatever its called)",
        "Beautiful location, great service, amazing views",
        "The location and grounds are beautiful, nice place to chill and relax and very cheap taxis ( blue Nusa Dua taxi) if you want to venture further afield for a while",
        "Palace lounge club staff were exceptional, however I have to agree with the other reviewer, on a couple of occasions service of drinks was pretty slow, you had to wonder why",
        "Breakfast is excellent, room service is quick, the pools are good (when they're not over run with children, but you can escape to the spa pool of you feel there is too much going on in the main pools)",
        "The hotel just looks and feels luxurious and you can spoil yourself rotten or lie back with a book",
        "What will cost you $5 at the laundrymat in Melbourne will cost you $70 easily here",
        "You will get soaked",
        "At this level of hotel you should get more privacy and protection from the elements",
        "4) the spa is lovely but try and ask for an experienced masseur as my second massage definitely did not hit the spot as you'd expect",
        "Nusa Dua itself is not very busy, which is sometimes exactly what you want!",
        "Pros: 3 pools , few restaurants , private beach, gym,Friendly squirrels",
        "Cons: Expensive to eat inside the hotel, but you will have no choice as there is no restaurants nearby , Have to take a taxi to go out or walk 20 -30 min",
        "Bit crowed but have to understand have 100's of room guest",
        "I can't imagine anyone could possibly complain about anything",
        "This is NOT a complaint, but as there was a big container of lovely iced chocolate, I would have loved the same of iced coffee - that would have been delicious",
        "It was a bit embarrassing watching some people carry a few pieces of whole fruit out of the restaurant to have later - does this happen all the time? I wouldn't have dreamt of doing that",
        "Thank you!",
        "We stayed in a nice room - which didn't have a view of the beach, however, unless you went out onto the balcony and twisted your neck around!!! There were renovations going on in some parts - the noise wasn't too bad, but we were aware of them",
        "e laundry, spa etc but I guess if you want the serene setting then you'll have to pay for it",
        "The food in restaurant and room service are delicious, but the price very expensive (especially in restaurant) and be ready to wait, its need 25 mnts for room service",
        "The hotel located in secure area call Nusa Dua, surrounded by a few 5 stars hotel, but the enterance security people who checking the guest (and car) sometimes overacting, especially if there is a coference running in that area, so be ready you must wait to be checked everytime you enter this area",
        "Had a lovely and relaxing stay at this hotel",
        "The food delicious and the prices very reasonable",
        "This seems to be an issue with communication (or understanding of english) with the restaurant staff",
        "The food was good; this resort was really valuable for money you spend on there",
        "At last I will be good if you have night at jimbaran sea food restaurant",
        "A true 5 Star hotel",
        "ocean not really swimmable",
        "The staff did a great job at making sure you were comfortable,",
        "The kids club has daily activities, so you can leave the little ones there, while you go for a massage or table tennis",
        "Everything is made freshly for you",
        "Spa treatments are of course pricey, and you can go to other local spa centres (pickup and drop off incl), but then again you are staying 5x star, so you have to expect this",
        "Premium level rooms were big enough and rooms were clean and tidy",
        "Their spa is fabulous and service is great",
        "The rooms are clean as you might expect from a hotel this calibre",
        "But do please recheck the cribs provided when you're bringing your baby",
        "As previously quoted this is a stunning resort with beautifully laid out grounds, semi private beach and a good few restaurants on site all serving very tasty,well presented dishes at a price !The complex has excellent sports facilities if you are feeling energetic complete with a jogging track laid out",
        "The only way to see some fish life is to hire one of the many boats from one of the beach vendors stalking the beach, and this is where things take a turn for the worse",
        "Excellent location",
        "Friendly staff",
        "Rooms comfortable",
        "Only half a litre of complimentary water per person",

        "Spotless beach & great gardens",
        "Only down fall is how expensive everything was",
        "just returned from a week stay at the nusa dua beach hotel we had read previous comments that really helped",
        "I went there 3 times and each time it was a different therapist all better the one from the other, the whole process makes you feel at ease and you are already relaxed before even beginning",
        "This was a beautiful place",
        "Many rooms, excellent service, clean, bathrobes, nice linens, great bfast, helpful staff",
        "The entrance area is open and welcoming leading to well attended gardens housing a few different style pool areas, restaurants, with quiet areas to repose in leading to the beach itself",
        "There is a jogging track which runs the length of the property and also the other 5 star resorts that border the beach",
        "Rooms are spacious, clean, two times a day they come and check if you need anything",
        "Nice terrace where you have a lovely view of the gardens",
        "In fact words can not describe fully what you get there",
        "There might be too many people in the breakfast room so you might better have breakfast in your room",
        "Beautiful hotel- gorgeous gardens and buildings",
        "Dont stay here if you are looking for bargains, or to do lots of shopping/tours- since its far away from most places, taxis/travel can get expensive if you dont know how to bargain well",
        "Come here if you want to spend your time getting spa treatments, swim in the pool and be pampered",
        "Lots of restaurants on-site and the poolside service was excellent",
        "This is a very big complex with many great facilities",
        "We also found because Nusa Dua is a gated area you miss the culture of Bali, however it depends on what you want from your holiday",
        "A special mention to the BREAKFAST: all you can imagine is there!",
        "The hotel is a great option if you are looking to stay in a nice place but still feel like you are in Bali - a lot of the other hotels in Nusa Dua could be anywhere in the world and you wouldn't know",
        "Food not too expensive",
        "Perhaps it was because we had stayed at smaller hotels with a more personalised service and this was a larger hotel",
        "It was nice to have time relaxing on the beach and if this is all you want to do this is fine",
        "There is a nice restaurant up the beach that offers lovely food at about half the price",
        "This hotel is located in a secluded 5 star resort area that is catering for the 5 star client",
        "But you are a short taxi ride from all the main destinations for food and drink",
        "awful smell",
        "nice pools etc, staff great",
        "This was our first trip to Bali and we didn't know what to expect",
        "Well let me tell you, it was out of this world and yes, I have travelled to many places throughout the world so feel justified in my comments",
        "No matter what you asked them for, nothing was too much bother",
        "Everyone had a smile on their faces and never passed you without a lovely smile and a friendly greeting",
        "As for the location, yes it is a wee bit away from Bali Collection, but hey a 10 minute walk along the beach front, shuttle bus from the hotel or a cheap taxi - you are never far away",
        ") are really pricey",
        "But that did not last long, as this Hotel is 5 star, and has everything you need for a beautiful stay",
        "We loved all the restaurants, and the beautiful walk along the beach at night time (when you walk past all the other Hotels)",
        "Great memories",
        "I visited a few other hotels including the Bale, the Westin and Club Med and I think that would be fair",
        "The staff - absolutely brilliant",
        "The grounds - beautifully maintained",
        "Very Balinese",
        "Ever so slightly tired around the pool areas - pools not quite as flash as the ones at the Westin or some of the others, the pool loungers older, towels not as smart - but frankly, the prices reflect that",
        "Location - this was prob the downside for us",
        "There shouldn't even be a TV in my opinion, and they certainly shouldn't be watching it when you have three staff members, two rooms full of toys, a playgound and a swimming pool at your disposal! Perhaps they should think about a booking-in system so at least they would know what activities they might do with those aged kids etc? Should be better kids meals available - I don;t think it is acceptable anymore to have a menu that is almost exclusively what i would call junk food (hotdogs, chicken nuggets)",
        "Unfortunately there was a group of very loud and rough sorts that moved in half way through our stay - the type that start drinking at 9am at the pool bar, shout obscenities across the pool at each other etc",
        "I should add they have water aerobics in the pool every morning - I am sure some people love it, but it is a pet hate of mine at hotels to have ridiculously loud music pumping through the pool area at 10am and shouting instructor, but maybe that is just me!",
        "I believe they haven't finished renovating the rooms, so remember to ask for the new one when you check in",
        "Very fresh",
        "Yes 1 degree makes quite a difference",
        "You name what you don't do in other hotels, they are more tolerant than you might think",
        "This could be bad as well",
        "Keep up the good work",
        "You will never be spoilt by the staff anywhere like you will here",
        "You can always go to the Oasis Beach REsort up the road for something new",
        "Occasional palms",
        "You won't get better than The Nusa Dua Beach",
        "It was the second time I went there, my memories were good and have been confirmed also this time",
        "You can see that is not modern but it recently went though a major renovation that made it up",
        "In general the stay in Nusa Dua area is very confortable since you can take advantage of the long walk on the beach and have wonderful morning run on it",
        "The big beach with it stable wind is really relaxing and you could stay lazily in the hotel if you want",
        "The only problem is traffic: to go from Nusa Dua to Seminyak you need to consider 30-40 minutes if you go at 17",
        "Going back to the Beach Hotel, the service is good and you will see everywere staff cheering and smiling at you and this put you in a very good mood",
        "Kids club is good but only if you have a child younger than 5 yr old",
        "56 people who attended the wedding mostly stayed here, and everyone was amazed at the level of service provided",
        "This is our favourite hotel in Bali and we have stayed there approximately 20 times so this can speak for itself",
        "But this is a matter of individual choice and your preferences",
        "Having all this you will never be hungry",
        "you can do better than that!",
        "For the sake of a 10 minute walk or 3 minute taxi ride I don't understand why anyone would eat at the hotel?!",
        "This was a joke",
        "This is far too much",
        "We were promised a surprise by the receptionist when we checked in but nothing ever arrived",
        "Selection of meals is varied depending what you want try Raja's for a nice night out at quality restaurant with Indonesian food",
        "Our rooms though were large and very comfortable",
        "overall a good vacation",
        "Plenty of sun lounges but as usual you need to get in early to get a good spot",
        "There are plenty of cheap and tasty dining options around the area if you jump in a taxi",
        "Nusa Dua is a resort area and I would only stay here if you want to unwind by sitting by the pool and not doing much",
        "If you want to get out and about and shop/party/dine I would recommend Legian or Seminyak",
        "Quiet, relaxing, fairly private",
        "But as it was our second last night the thought of chnaging was hard work and incovenient",
        "The only blemish on what was an enjoyable stay",
        "More expensive than local cars but the drivers are careful and know what they are doing and the cars are well maintined",
        "A good guy!! To be greeted by courteous drivers with chilled water in hand was a nice touch to and from the hotel",
        "If you do spend the extra and pay a lot more you do get free wifi",
        "So weighing up that cost that is individual choice",
        "Clean rooms and rubbish whisked away, which when you are shopping is a bonus",
        "The air conditioning does switch down to low when you open the door to the balcony but that is fair enough and explained when you are escorted to your room",
        "Stay here if you want to enjoy the quiet side of Bali and relax in a quiet untroubled beach front resort",
        "Thanks to Arini (customer relations) who sorted us out last visit (Mr Billy Williams), we have never looked back as far as accommodation in Bali goes",
        "very special",
        "The hotel has has several beautiful swimming pools and a great location beach, lots of gardens were you can relax",
        "You can take a 10 min walk down de beautiful beach an you are in the Bali Collection Centre where you can shop and eat in lots of restaurants with live music",
        "the palace club package is great if you like to eat and drink! All the restaurants are great",
        "It was such a pleasure to see them come for their feeding and the cameras would be flashing",
        "The staff went above and beyond to make sure you had a great stay and very friendly and courteous",
        "Found breakfast nice but nothing special",
        "The room itself was very basic, the TV was quite old and lacked a lot in options, you really end up watching a lot of Discovery and Animal Planet due to the lack of options",
        "The aircon was okay, though in the humid temperatures you cannot expect air con to work perfectly",
        "Though do note regarding the Main Pool and Lagoon pool that they both close at 7pm",
        "Nice rooms",
        "Food items run out fast due to crowds during holiday season but this is no excuse for staff to be slow in replenishing the items",
        "You then end up waiting many minutes for them to bring it out from the galley",
        "The egg station chef informed us that there were no more mushrooms for the day and this was at 9",
        "This was the greatest disappointment for us",
        "Big sprawling hotel that lacks charm",
        "com), and I suppose as you got the room at a discounted price you are treated accordingly",
        "I suppose this is just a ploy to extract more dollars from unsuspecting guests",
        "basically inedible",
        "I really intend eating outside every night as the thought of spending more money here doesn't sit well with me",
        "The Deluxe room was pretty nice, not outstanding, attention to detail in some parts were lacking, especially in the bathroom, where nothing was square",
        "A nice range of shampoos, soaps, shower caps, tooth brushes etc certainly made staying here just that little bit easier",
        "The air-conditioner is absolutely freezing; we had it set on low every time and at night you are always snuggled up deep in the blanks next to your other half! Speaking about the bed, the bed and pillows were a bit firm for our liking, but we never had any real trouble getting to sleep",
        "They have this amazing shack type beds on the beaches from where you can enjoy the spectacular sea view for endless hours",
        "Breakfast was very succesfull , delicious and many kind of food was available to everyone",
        "Everyone was really helpful and professional",
        "Thank you nusa dua beach hotel",
        "These guys really take cleanliness as their number one issue",
        "We had our room made up for three times a day, and yes they refill all the bath amenities so you dont have to worry will run out of bath gel or shampoo",
        "They situated not too far from the Nusa Dua entrance gate, but quite far from the Bali Collection mall, where you can get more restaurant options beside theirs",
        "To get there, you need to wait for a shuttle bus that pick and drop you up from and to the hotel",
        "They have wonderfull scenery at their main gate, which you can use as your photo background",
        "The ambience is also quite and relaxing, for those who looked for an oasis for a beautifull relaxing trip, this is the place!",
        "Overall, what we love is the bedroom that is so comfortable! The bathroom is being part of what we love about it",
        "Thankyou Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for such a lovely stay",
        "I politely said no, we had booked a \"Superior Room\", but you have housed us in a \"Sub Standard Room\"",
        "Having stayed on three separate occasions in Bali at the Grand Bali Hyatt, the Intercontinental and the Kamandala, and on our outward trip this time at Poppies, where the standards at all were excellent, our experience at the Nusa Dua Beach bore no resemblance to any of those hotels, nor, indeed, to any of the numerous hotel we have ever stayed at in South East Asia",
        "Also, if this is the type of accommodation agreed by the likes of Agoda, then neither shall I use them again",
        "This is one of the original resorts in Nusa Dua",
        "The staff are exceptional and make you feel like part of their family",
        "Everything is presented beautifully and exceedingly generous",
        "Everything is spotless and meticulously kept",
        "It is one of the most relaxing holidays you could have",
        "The cultural shows were a bonus and there is lots to see in BALI",
        "The place has a great feel and atmosphere, the entrance is grand and the general look of the place is something you'd expect from a classically luxury Resort",
        "Bali seems to stop at the guarded gates that lead into the Nusa Dua area where everything is safe and pretty much manufactured",
        "Overall a great experience",
        "Excellent room, view, service, amenities, location, guest activities",
        "can't think of anything that went wrong!",
        "The breakfast was amazing and included everything you needed to start the day",
        "Outstanding service, polite staff, romantic pool bar and many other things will make You enjoy your stay",
        "The rooms are spacious, we were concerned about the construction works mentioned by other travellers, but actually it was not noticeable that half of the hotel was undergoing some reconstruction everything was neat and quite",
        "It's worth it to upgrade to the palace rooms so you get free drinks & food at the happy hour",
        "I also had one of the best meal in Bali at the hotel signature pizzeria, Sandro's Pizzeria, you'll ask for more than you could chew!",
        "The food is top class and is kind of expensive compared to the rest of Bali but you are paying for quality",
        "The resort's beach isn't very nice but is good to explore at low tide if you are after water sports this is the place to be with all the activities available right at the beach",
        "Over all we enjoyed the peace and quiet and the space the resort offered the gardens and surrounds were well kept",
        "As I said above the only detraction was the renovations that were occurring",
        "The refurbished deluxe rooms are modern and well appointed; the bathroom design around the shower is not great as water leaks all over the floor when you use the shower, a clear design fault",
        "The day spa is a must, this has recently been upgraded and a great way to indulge",
        "There is many staff that has worked at the Hotel for more than 20 years and offer true Balinese hospitality with a smile",
        "Stayed at the Resort for a week -- great experience -- lovely beach front except of you are looking for waves you dont get them here",
        "The beach front is very calm which means you do find a lot of weeds in the water",
        "Our stay at nusa dua was great",
        "Our room was a triple that was just remodeled",
        "There wasn't much going on for activities, so if your looking for quiet and calm this your spot",
        "Nusa Dua is a lovely area to stay if you prefer to be away from all the hustle and bustle but is a nightmare in traffic during peak traffic times to get back to",
        "It's a building site, ugly and overly expensive for the service you get!!! There are so many hotels in this area that you can choose a lot better",
        "If you want to sit on a deck chair your whole holiday, then this is the place for you",
        "Where do I start from the front desk girl that lied to me or the old man working at the concierge desk that did not speak english,the bed that felt like I was sleeping on a piece of plywood,the construction that went from 6a,m, till 10p",
        "86 but their money change desk only gave you",
        "The blow dryer was screwed down in a drawer so you do not steal it and you had to keep your finger on the button for it to stay on",
        "00 for 15 minutes,their wed site says they have a WHITE sand beach,no it is a sandy color beach,the beach and water looks beautiful when the tide is in put ugly when the tide is out,only thing I likes here was the pool and grounds",
        "This wasn't very comfortable",
        "The new part looks lovely and if you do find the restaurants and spa pricey there is a free shuttle buss to Bali Collection, where you can get a variety of restaurant to dine in",
        "When you arrive to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, you are immediately in awe of the beauty and details around every corner",
        "The staff takes care of your luggage, so you get the care-free feeling right away",
        "There are plenty of lounge chairs by the pools and on the beach, but you may want to save a spot early enough to have a place in the shade",
        "Also, the locals will be selling souvenirs on the beach- just politely say 'no thanks",
        "You may have a balcony close to another room's balcony",
        "Everyone from the receptionist to the gardner says \"hello, how are you?\" and when we have called reception or room service they have responded within a couple seconds",
        "This is so far number 1 on our list of venues to renew these vowes",
        "Beautiful hotel and grounds",
        "Older hotel but rooms and hotel in excellent shape",
        "This resort is excellent if you want to relax being peaceful",
        "Friendly courteous and helpful staff",
        "Great rooms, good internet",
        "Really relaxing and very tropical",
        "The beach is lovely, but you can't really swim unless you like a lot of seaweed",
        "So they were good, but not great",
        "Good food, well priced",
        "There is nowhere close to walk for lunch/dinner, so if this is important to you don't stay here",
        "I can honestly say that everyone was so polite and went out of their way to do everything they could to make our stay special",
        "There was plenty to do if you want to be active (tennis courts, squash courts, table tennis, pool table, chess tables, spa, lap pool, basketball, bikes for hire etc), as well as daily scheduled activities to join in to if you want",
        "Yes, it is expensive but when booking a 5 star then surely that is to be expected",
        "It is the small gestures that count",
        "I don't agree with previous reviews that you are forced to eat at the expensive restaurants",
        "There are many places to eat at the Bali Collection or walk out the main gate, slightly closer to the hotel and you will find more eateries",
        "If you intend going to Kuta then walk out the gate and catch a Blue Bird taxi, insist on the meter",
        "the breathtaking entranceway",
        "l wanted to hug everyone upon leaving",
        "What a great guy !!!",
        "The hotel itself is very pretty, more Balinese style than others around it",
        "The rooms are fine, nice flat screen TV's and nice little balconies",
        "Keep in mind that you will be forced more or less to the high prices at the hotel restaurants",
        "If you would like to find more to choose from you will have to leave the area and take a walk for about 15-25 minutes to find other restaurants with lower prices (however still high prices for Bali)",
        "For my taste it is too isolated and expensive area; you will not get to know Bali there",
        "There are lot of greater places on Bali",
        "This was a nice hotel with good helpful staff",
        "Im generally not one for \"sit on a beach/at a pool and relax\" holidays, but this was a very nice place to spend one",
        "About the only downside I found was that the restaurant selection in the resort is a bit limited, and it is a bit of a pain to go out of the resort (other than a free shuttle to a local shopping mall, which has a selection of restaurants, but why stay in a resort if we was to take the shuttle outside to eat?) One night we took a taxi from the hotel to Kuta (100k fixed price to get there, but you are on your own to find a ride back) for dinner, which was a nice change",
        "If you demand a 5-star resort, you will probably want to look elsewhere",
        "This is the great ever hotel !!! Very reflexing,every morning, when i went out to the balcony, i will see some ducks catching around at small garden",
        "They provide us wheelchair for our grandmother that hardly to walk",
        "Very friendly staff",
        "If you don't want the rooms that haven't yet been revamped, then just pay the extra ($30USD/night) and upgrade to a newly renovated",
        "Would certainly return",
        "Lovely, helpful and always smilling",
        "There are no flat screen TV's or sound systems, but you do get a DVD player",
        "The lounge is open 24/7, so you can pop in for a drink or biscuit or fruit any time you like",
        "They are happy to assist you with any request, and a really obliging",
        "I say stay here just for the more interesting design of the hotel if you're looking for a resort in the Nusa Dua area",
        "There is a check-out room for showering and relaxing after you have checked out",
        "This is set in the walled community that is Nusa Dua",
        "Because this is in a walled community, it is a bit of a walk to the shops unless you avail yourself of the free shuttle buses to Bali Connection or if you go to a restaurant that provides pick-up",
        "The staff cannot recommend any outside vendors to you, so you are on your own if you want to find another place to eat/spa outside of the hotel",
        "Rooms, service and staff very impressive",
        "Everything with the arrival and check in was smooth and fast",
        "My mums standard room was even bigger than ours, but not so decorative",
        "the \"village\" of nusa dua is a 5 min walk away and you can eat better valued food there if you prefer",
        "will definitely return",
        "A large bathroom with a bathtub that could double as a shower and a separate shower cubicle",
        "The food and service were excellent and all the staff seemed genuinely interested in making our stay enjoyable",
        "Everyone, including the cleaners, were friendly and courteous and provided first class service",
        "This was a very pleasant experience",
        "If you are looking for a first class hotel experience in a nice location in Bali, you can't go wrong here",
        "GO and have a pleasant stay",
        "You will return rejenuvated",
        "The beach was clean, neat and well organized, that meant no need to rush-rush somewhere else to catch a glimpse of the beach",
        "BUT, don't get stuck at the hotel pool everyday -you can do that at home! Be sure to get out and see BALI while you're there! Hire a driver (only $40 US dollars for an entire day! and have them take you to see traditional Balinese temples, the Monkey Forest, go river rafting, ride elephants and go snorkeling",
        "Work a deal for yourself",
        "There are the positive and less positive elements that are for me important to talk about",
        "Very thoughtful staff that was also very obliging with children",
        "* Luxuriant gardens that make you feel like in paradise",
        "* there is another pool called the lagoon that did not seem very clean",
        "* many seaweeds in the sea that made swimming not very confortable (but similar to all beaches of the area)",
        "Traffic jams to enter or to go out Nusa dua are usual and really boring each time you plan excursions",
        "We've stayed in palace rooms and deluxe rooms - do palace if you want the extras, or don't and buy your cocktails at happy hour at the beachfront Chess Bar instead, and spend the extra on local cuisine - this was our preference",
        "The restaurants have lovely food (not a fan of the Italian pizza restaurant sadly), but make sure you eat outside as well",
        "If you need to relax this is the place!",
        "The front office staff were very efficient and pleasant and they were always trying to make our stay more enjoyable",
        "This is also a good place to purchase souvenirs and local handicrafts",
        "My daughter had opted for a better room, they had a private dining room for breakfast and afternoon tea, but the buffet breakfast was great and you are really spoiled for choice",
        "Everywhere you go there are flowers and petals and gorgeous smelling oils, and you are offered a cold scented flannel every time you sit down to eat",
        "The beaches were lovely and you could walk for miles",
        "It is quite exhausting to walk it at night time because of the humidity, but there is a complementary bus that goes about every half hour or so",
        "We hired bikes a few times from the hotel, you get them at the gym area next to the tennis courts",
        "The spa was very nice, I treated myself to a massage and had a nice peaceful swim in the spa pool",
        "If you want to relax by the pool all day then this is a great hotel to stay at",
        "Regarding Nusa Dua in general (and not the hotel), during the day and travelling by taxi it took almost an hour to get to Kuta, and nearly two hours to get to Ubud, so if you want to get out and about in Bali most days then this should be considered",
        "and has a walkway path in which you can passby other hotels",
        "very safe",
        "There are lots of boutique shops appx 20 min walk from the hotel",
        "there are lots of clubs 2 visit once night fallsss too for the",
        "Has an amazing charm to it",
        "Bali is beautiful beyond belief but the people are also what make it",
        "The Hotel itself is a wonderful complex , mainly decked out in traditional balanese culture,",
        "the staff can not be faulted, ( the Balanese are a people blessed with a beautiful nature) and do every thing they can to ensure you enjoy your stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "Larger room and better amenities",
        "Nusa Dua is the place if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle",
        "There is also work going on at the hotel to refurbish a whole section of rooms but it wasn't intrusive and the fact that half the hotel was closed actually made getting a sunbed in the morning much easier!! It must be very difficult when it's full",
        "The only negative comment we have is that food and drinks were very expensive - but then it is a 5* hotel so this is to be expected",
        "We also ate at a restaurant at the Bali Collective - a lovely 10 miunte walk from the hotal along the beach path - this was good but expensive, and at Jimbaran Beach - great for sunsets and fresh fish",
        "bed and room facilities were very comfortable, perfect place for a romantic break (if you avoid the main pool area between 11 and 3)!",
        "Our recent stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was very relaxing",
        "The open air lobby with koi ponds and lush green immaculate grounds, private beach, two pools and several wonderful restaurants make it so you almost don't ever want to leave the property",
        "The room and bath were clean just in need of update",
        "The service is overall ok but very uneven, sometimes you get the very nice cold towel before you order lunch in the restaurant and sometimes not",
        "Although this review is very pessimistic, the hotel itself is ok if you are aware of all this but of all hotels that ive stayed in around Asia, this was the most overpriced one",
        "My advice is to try another and see if you get more for your money there",
        "nice pool and gardens",
        "The hotel is also located right at the gates of the Nusa Dua complex so you can also walk out and browse some shops and restaurants",
        "The beach however wasn't very nice",
        "So if you want a good beach, look elsewhere!",
        "The hotel has stood the test of time, it was opened around 1983 and is now undergoing some renovations, this however, did not cause any inconvenience to our stay",
        "My son who is 15 asked if the hotel was an old palace, it does have feeling of old Bali grandeur about it, I liked it as although it is an old hotel it still feels very much like a Bali hotel, some of the newer hotels feel as if you could be anywhere in the world",
        "So friendly and so willing to help you out with just about anything",
        "Great place",
        "The best thing about Nusa Dua is the beautiful gardens, orderly roads/pathways and only a few locals of the beach selling things",
        "If you don't want noise, traffic, night clubs and locals trying to sell to you constantly this is the best place to stay",
        "You can still visit Kuta in a local taxi for around no more than AUD$10 each way",
        "Pros: beautiful grounds, beach location, staff",
        "Cons: there's no real \"town\" that's in close walking distance (Bali Complex - stores, restaurants - seemed more for tourists), Ubud is 1",
        "A great resort to stay, however not if you want to experience the Indonesian feeling",
        "This was our second stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our Wedding Anniversary",
        "This is a hotel to relax and be pampered",
        "way too short if you visiting Bali and want to enjoy the Hospitality of this amazing hotel",
        "Every enquiry or request was dealt with a smile and effortlessly",
        "There was also a lap pool, however we didn't see this because it was in the spa area and this was being refurbished during our stay",

        "The location of the hotel is good -- inside the somewhat sterile, but certainly quite safe compound of Nusa Dua, about a 15 min",
        "Just make sure that, if you come to Bali, you don't spend all your time just in Nusa Dua -- spend more of your time in Ubud!",
        "The poolside staff also offered very good service They were ever-present and unobtrusive and appeared magically when you need to order drinks or food",

        "The Nusa Dua section of the island of Bali is almost like a \"gated community\" in itself",
        "The roads in and out are controlled by heavy security, as are the individual properties, so you immediately feel very safe and secure",
        "There are also hawkers on the beach to sell you fishing or snokeling trips on their boats that are moored out front, or to sell you jet-ski rides",
        "We casually \"inspected\" each of the other properties during our stay, in case we found a better one than ours, but ours was by far the overall best, for many reasons",
        "The cost of everything, except alcohol, is cheap by any standards, and for variety of food you can travel to the nearby \"Bali Collection\" (1",
        "5km away) , a Mall-type design of stores, supermarkets, clothing and merchandise stalls, and many restaurants, all of which will provide you with free taxi transport to and from the resort (provided you eat at their restaurant of course)",
        "I suggest that you will benefit from using \"google earth\" to look at the location also",
        "The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful",

        "The check out lounge providing air-con waiting area, showers + lockers for those that want to make the most of their day after checking out of rooms before leaving",
        "Taxi everywhere you go outside of resort",
        "Reni and Dwi did an amazing job, nothing was too much trouble for them",

        "If you use the free transport (both ways), you can stock up on drinks & snacks very cheaply either before or after dinner",
        "The first price quoted by the seller is usually ridiculously high, you should pay no more than prices quoted above",
        "( you can get cheap massarges on the beach but never tried )",
        "We did not rush around sightseeing as this was our annual holiday",
        "You can sit there looking at the squrills run ip and down the large trees or the swallows flying around all day",

        "Kuta is 15 minutes away if you want that",
        "Great entertainment and dinner facilities",
        "Your pool towels were also on the sun lounges waiting for you, unlike the main pool where you have to give them some sort of token for a towel",
        "There is a supermarket in Bali Collection which is where I suggest you stock up on drinks and snacks, and also things to replace items from the mini bar",
        "Also, if you are going into Kuta at all, their supermarkets are significantly cheaper than the one in Nusa Dua, so buy all of your more expensive items whilst you are there",
        "Our room was clean and spacious and I had a King size bed to myself while my daughter and her friend were given an adjoining room and their own bathroom( having 2 19 year old girls this was a relief for me)",

        "We stayed in the paradise club which I would recommend if you can, as you get a free brekfast, afternoon tea and cocktails in the evening in a quiet out of the way reeoption room",
        "The hotel has 300+ rooms so this means that the pool will get quite crowded and it can be a problem trying to find a sunbed, you will get the obligatory towel reserving which is a pet hate of mine, however I had no qualms in removing towels that had been there for 30mins+ without an occupier anywhere to be seen and pinching it for myself ;-D",
        "The beach is not the best and to be honest we didn't venture onto it once, but as we had recently been in the maldives this may have just been me being a bit picky",
        "We stayed in a deluxe room that faced the pool and the ocean",
        "If this is your first time to Bali, we highly recommend that you bring CRISP currency notes from your country",
        "Only 2 free bottles of water a day but more could be had if you asked the cleaning crew nicely!",
        "This continued for 1",
        "We were then taken to a room past building work that was going on",
        "Our room was dirty, the bathroom had not been cleaned properly and it smelt a bit funny",
        "The water is very clear on the beach but you cannot swim out very far",
        "However should you fancy a night on the town then Kuta is the place to go $10 USD will get you there in a taxi (about 20 mins) and you can party on till the early hours",
        "Pretty much everything is great about this hotel and im sure if your going you will have a great time unless your a fussy and a unhappy couple!!",
        "Anyway have a great time you'll love it",
        "Happy Holidays",
        "WOW just got back from Bali , Nusa Dua Beach and Spa Hotel and have to say what a great holiday",
        "(was there for two weeks) Normally there is something that always spoils your holiday but this was faultless, great food , great prices, hotel was spotless, (seems they just love to clean) room was attended to at least twice a day and never anywhere ive been have i met such friendly staff, everyone was so kind and helpful",
        "If you are looking for a holiday where u can really relax then this is the place for u",
        "For me and my wife this has been our best holiday ever and would have no hesitation jumping back on a plane tomorrow and heading back for another two weeks of paradise",
        "The bedroom area had a massive bed (King size) and it was surrounded by a mosquito net (which you could put down in the evening and left up during the day)",
        "Our room opened onto our own private patio area where there were two sunbeds for relaxing on if you so wished to do",
        "If you are out and about during the day, your taxi driver is more than happy to stop and let you stock up (of course the meter will be running, but the taxis are so cheap anyway this does not matter)",
        "I was told that someone on another floor must have pushed the button",
        "Nusa Dua is a nice resort for a relaxing holiday but if you want a nice room this is not the best hotel to go to",
        "myself and my new wife have just returned from paradise !",
        "you were left 2 glass bottles of water in your room,if you wanted more you then had to buy some,you had the choice of the mini bar drinks and snacks",
        "the other trip was horse riding along the beach which was 1hr dive,you were there for about 2 hours,then we drove a further1hr to get to the elephant ride,it was busy and what we didnt realise that you were fed there too,so we had a meal first looking over the beautiful forest scenery,we had a 30min walk on our elephant,you could also pay for an hour,you are asked if you would like your pic taken,in the pool or with the trees only costing",
        "As for the sun beds, if you were up early or before about 9 you were ok, you have the usual people that set there alarms,but normaly you were ok,we always got our towels and beds then went down to breakfast, Which is really good,lots too choose from hot and cold",
        "From the arrival everything was just perfect, private transfer from the Airport, wonderfull reception with a tropical fruit drink, a great room with a well chilled bottle of champagne and above all , a great staff with a very good knowledge and practice of what customer focus means",
        "Every morning you can feel the wonders of nature right at your balcony enjoying a cup of hot coffee and watching every type of birds or squirrels right there at your footstep",
        "It's ok but nothing special and you could be anywhere",
        "You really feel like a V",
        "Nothing is to much for them",
        "I thnik this gives the hotel a different and unique atmosphere",
        "If you go to Bali",
        "Very comfortable bed",
        "Friendly staff",
        "It is perfect for a romantic holiday, or if you just need to relax and be pampered",
        "This is so not true",
        "Regarding the food, very expensive, but after all what do you expect from a world class resort",
        "Fantastic place!",
        "I highly recommend this hotel, the staff are wonderful and if you can afford to upgrade to a Palace club room",
        "The only thing I would not do whilst in Bali is go to the Turtle Island that we were taken to as it is a place where they let adults and children actually sit on the poor turtles and they have nik naks to take home made out of turtle shell! I felt very sorry for the animals and felt bad that i had just paid to get in and encourage this to continue",
        "We went on a bike ride with one of the staff as an activity and I highly recommend doing this as you will see the real Bali and some beautiful scenes",
        "v) were a little old & worn however this did not spoil it at all",
        "Benefits of upgrading to the Palace Club were seperate check in at their lounge area (which is exclusively for the use of Palace club guests), breakfast served in the lounge area (with a lovely view overlooking the gardens) also included in the price was afternoon tea & cakes (We did not try these), soft drinks all day and evening cocktails between 6pm - 8pm, if you didnt want cocktails you could have beer / wine etc as an alternative",
        "The pool area could do with a little attention as it is looking a bit worn (a few loose tiles, etc) however there is a lovely lawned sunbathing area just between the beach & pools, so you get the best of both worlds",
        "If you happen to go a bit late to the pool or beach area, you have the chance of not finding a chair",
        "This realy is an amzing hotel, we paid to be upgraded to the 'deluxe wing' and you really get great value for money doing this private check in, own breakfast room (with the other guests from the wing) afternoon tea included each day, all suites (ours was on the ground floor over looking the gardens and a small temple!",
        "The staff are SO lovely - they can not do enough for you and the little guy who works the pool bar is a sweetie - make sure you tip him at teh beginning of your stay and he will look after you with extra large drink through your stay",
        "The beach is lovely and clean, the water is warm and has lots of fish in it - if you like to snorkle",
        "They do theme nights to during the week and these can be quite fun (if you like to socialise",
        "However, this is a typical international luxury hotel with no soul",
        "Fine if you don't want the real Bali",
        "If you want to travel all the way to Bali to stay in a bubble, this would be OK, but if you want a real travel experience, find somewhere more interesting",
        "The gardens and pool areas were quite pleasant with plenty of loungers and chairs, the beach was not quite so tidy, oil patches here and there and of course the usual constant prosession of people trying to sell you their wares, this can become a bit tiresome",
        "I would definately recommend upgrading to a Palace Club room because as a member of the Palace Club you get extra benefits like afternoon tea, soft drinks at any time, and evening cocktails",
        "Our son made use of the Gecko Kids club a couple of times through our stay, and he usually didn't like to be dragged away as he was having so much fun",
        "There are men on the beach offering boat trips forsnorkelling etc, and if you ask them, they can organise just about any water sport you can think of",
        "Failing that, the staff in the hotel will also be able to point you in the right direction of whatever you wish to do and be able to organise it for you",
        "The Palace Club rooms are on the ground floor, and the first impression you get walking in was the smell of dampness",
        "The covers on the bed felt damp, and the air smelt musty",
        "The other impression is of claustrophobia",
        "You get used to it, but you don't enjoy it so much",
        "Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa only really stands out if you don't compare it with these two neighbours",
        "Check-out timing is pretty flexible even if you arrange for it last-minute, as in our case",
        "The safe deposit box in our room could not be used and the wiring of the lights was faulty, flickering once in a while",
        "There is a feeling of a strong push to consume and there is not much for free",
        "This is our first time visit to the hotel",
        "This hotel is a member of Leading Hotel of the World that have a reasonable price",
        "There no need to worry if you wanted to shop",
        "This was easy accomomdated",
        "We booked 6 nights in a palace club room as you pay a bit extra but then get things like free soft drinks, canapes and cocktails in the evening, afternoon tea and breakfast",
        "The staff could not do enough for us and made our stay really special",
        "One of the best bits is the bar in the middle of the pool, you can swim up to it anytime of the day or evening and have a cold relaxing Bintang! We ate at the hotel half the time, and the food was very good although quite expensive",
        "There are lots of different events going on at the hotel, the traditional Balinese meal and dancing is really good although again, a bit pricey",
        "Afterwards you can take a great romantic walk along the beach path too to wear it off!",
        "Simply Amazing accomidations,staff and service",
        "The staff was really friendly and helpful, but the again, I think this is a Balinese treat, so I guess any good hotel will serve you that",
        "Overall great value",
        "Hope this helps!",
        "Best regards,",
        "It's a classic \"pool and beach\"-resort where you can hang around the whole day or entertain yourself with the usual staff like ping-pong, beach-volley, jet-ski etc",
        "Don't get me wrong, it is still on a very fair and good level, but when claiming being on of the best, this critic is apropriate",
        "Everything is 3 times more expensive",
        "But you can simply avoid this by renting a motor-bike and exploring the sourundings on your own",
        "This was a great way to spend a week of our honeymoon",
        "Altogether a very relaxing holiday, excellent accommodation, good food and superb service",
        "We enjoyed our stay here but one thing we did find was that we became a little bored as for us there was not a lot of evening entertainment",
        "If you want total relaxation then this is the hotel for you",
        "The Nusa Dua Beach hotel depends on what you want",
        "I just found myself asking - whats the point",
        "Apart from the admittedly impressive entrance designed in a balinese temple style this could have been anywhere in the world",
        "It is a shame that you DO NOT get extra little touches like: flowers in room, chocolate on pillow or fruit by pool (unless you pay of course)",
        "You get your own Villa with small pool in lush garden setting with extras you don't get at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for $200 per night and much much better value spa ($25 US for 2 hours), food and drinks etc",
        "The exerience was very calm and personal",
        "It's definately worth paying a bit extra to have palace club access if you're staying here for a special occasion",
        "My new hubby would have liked a beach where you could swim properly - the water is very shallow, take a pair of water shoes and you can explore the shallows",
        "A great hotel if you want to relax and get away from it all",
        "My wife (still not used to saying that!) and I stayed at this hotel for just over a week a few weeks ago as part of our honeymoon",
        "The entrance to the hotel is spectacular and makes a great first impression when you first arrive",
        "We would definitely recommend the upgrade if you can stretch to it",
        "In terms of the location of the hotel, yes it is situated in a very sanitised complex which is very secure - you go through one checkpoint just to get into the Nusa Dua area and then another one to get into the hotel - but there is plenty of opportunity to book day trips out to other parts of the island if you want to experience the 'real' Bali",
        "If you are after a very comfortable, relaxing hotel, and are looking forward to spending the majority of your time chilling out rather than sightseeing, stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "good service",
        "if you planning to go bali",
        "this is the right spot",
        "the only downside is that you have to get to the beach or pool early to reserve a beach/pool bed so I do think that they need to look into getting a few more but that is just a small niggle, About 10 mins walk from the hotel is the Bali Collection a shopping complex with some nice shopping and lovely restaurants that are very cheap to eat in and the food is great, this is all to cater for the tourist so you do need to get out of your hotel and see the proper Bali, i can recommend the mountain bike trip 2 hours downhill so hardly any peddeling and you go through the bali villages and see the children, schools, paddi fields and end at the elephant sanctury this is a wonderful day",
        "kept and maintained perfectly",
        ") I highly recommend staying here, and yes the food may bit a bit $$$ than being in Kuta, but that;s the choice you make either stay in a 5 star hotel and don't whinge or go",
        "Everything about the hotel met my expectations",
        "The bathroom of the deluxeroom is so much better - both shower and tub and open shutters so You get a view of bedroom and even a bit beyond",
        "Beach is very nice but again seaweed in water makes swimming a bit difficult",
        "We checked into the palace rooms and on the 7 occasions we went for breakfast our order was wrong",
        "to be covered in ants each morning either and yes i know it is an outside area but there are ways to prevent this from happening",
        "The rooms could do with a bit of a touch up but all in all they were comfortable and spacious not that you spend much time in it",
        "The property is shabby and does not have the \"wow\" factor present in other hotels",
        "This was my fourth visit to Bali, fourth time staying at Nusa Dua but first stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "The thing that I like about Nusa Dua is it allows you stay in a location away from the hustle, bustle and touting that is Kuta and (to an extent) Sanur",
        "As for the hotel, there is not much else to say other than perfect",
        "Sure, food is expensive, but you expect that at such a hotel",
        "I made a couple of short local calls that ended up being very expensive",
        "Overall, the room and hotel grounds are nice, but I did not go to Bali to stay at a hotel that could have been anywhere",
        "You may enjoy swimming in the pool and sitting by the beach, but know that you will not experience Bali",
        "No need in looking for something better! Everything is perfect! Would definitely visit again",
        "We had no problems, but sitting on the patio outside your room, it feels a bit public",
        "Breakfast, Afternoon Tea and evening Cocktails with Appetisers are a real treat and quite sufficient to keep you going throughout the day, if you wish",
        "Our room was clean, traditionally furnished (incorporating Balinese wood carvings) and offered all the facilities you would expect in a 4",
        "The beach is not so great, we are beach lovers, with sea grasses you have to walk through to get to clearer waters",
        "We did a local dinner one night at Sharkeys that was very fun and great food you pick out of the aquarium and is cooked for you",
        "The room is very clean, fresh sheets every day, towels twice a day if you want, free water, ice if needed and supper delivered to the room if so desired",
        "Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa is a fantastic accomodation and has everything you would want for a relaxing holiday",
        "Nusa Dua is the best example of the balinese hospitatlity the staff, food, spa,bars,landscaping,Restaurants & especially the evening market which they set up everything is simply amazing",
        "Overall just a great place to stay!",
        "Book extra with the Palace Club and you wil have the time of your life",
        "What a great hotel! The staff were excellent and the room beautiful! I really recommend the in house restaurant! fantastic local baliense food",
        "An excellent international class 5 star hotel with all the amenities you would expect",
        "We booked 3 day trips with the hotels driver- Mr Youdana, who is so patient and considerate especially if you are travelling with kids",
        "This was my 7th visit to Bali, and my first honeymoon there! I've visited every hotel at Nusa Dua and some are fancier, more modern, newer, and more international than this one",
        "But, you're going to Bali, aren't you? Some of the others could be Tokyo or some generic beach resort",
        "You won't find stainless steel and glass moderne here",
        "You won't need to eat until dinner, and will probably find yourself lingering a long time because of the ambience",
        "After a not-so-warm welcome from Customs at the airport, we were a bit anxious and not sure what to expect from the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",
        "Breakfast choices were extensive, and the tables were overlooking ponds with fish and water lilies to look at as you dine!",
        "We had booked half board, and you can use any of the restaurants for dinner",
        "The resort is immaculately kept, the security guards ensure the environment feels safe, and the shopping centre is worth a visit too - the \"labels\" are amazing value",
        "We weren't sure what to expect of our visit - but this place really gets under your skin by the time you leave!",
        "believe me - there is such a huge difference, and if you can, choose the Palace Club Room!!",
        "A beautiful fresh flower arrangement and bowl of fresh fruit are lovely touches when you first arrive into the room",
        "If you're looking for a western style, ultra modern hotel, then it's not the Nusa Dua, but if you want Balinese culture, a quality service and a hotel offering excellent facilities - look no further",
        "You may not even notice them",
        "you find yourself trying to learn some basic balinese greetings just to say thank you etc",
        "From the time you get out of your transport bringing you from the airport to the time you leave, you will receive a first class service from this hotel",
        "you won't be dissappointed!",
        "The rooms have large balconies which lead straight out to a beautiful garden with pond and fantastic trees and plants - a little slice of heaven when you wake up in the morning",
        "The beach is nice, though you can't swim in the sea",
        "As far as the leading hotels of the world tag goes, I am not quite sure what this means and who awards it, but if you take it literally you may be disappointed, a discerning traveler, used to staying at the worlds finest, will probably find that this does not quite compare",
        "This is purely personal preference",
        "There are also lots of water sports available at Benoa just down the beach",
        "All beach sellers are licensed and you will get none of the hassle you may experience at Kuta beach",
        "A great place for relaxation, honeymoons, weddings and all",
        "This hotel is fine if you are happy staying in a huge resort that could be anywhere in the world",
        "The gardens and sculptures are beautiful, and your first impression of the lobby is beautiful",
        "then you get to the rooms",
        "The beach was pretty, but not really swimmable",
        "The pool bar was also great, and the bartender very friendly",
        "Always asking if you are ok etc",
        "This was very luxurious, you felt completely relaxed and pampered",
        "Overall a wonderful place",
        "Lovely gardens everywhere",
        "You did feel as if you were in some sort of paradise",
        "These hotels could be at any beach (from Hawaii to Phuket), but at least with the NDB Hotel, you knew you were in Bali",
        "The Nusa Dua Beach area was completely manufactured and isolated for tourists, so if you want western conviences (there is even a Starbucks in walking distance at the Bali Collection) and safety this is the place",
        "Can be a fairly nice hotel if you plan to travel with your kids",
        "The hotel has great character and is not what you would call truly modern but that added to the charm of the place",
        "There are a variety of restaurants so you can choose what you want from Pizza through to 5* cuisine",
        "First, the good things :",
        "2) The Spa is honestly really good",
        "We had a look at these before we left and they are wonderful plus you get all the club benefits such as free 24hr non-alcoholic drinks, afternoon tea and drinks and hors d'eouvres in the evening",
        "Lovely gardens, pools, statues and water features",
        "This is a lovely setting overlooking a large pond and gardens",

        "They charge for wifi and after a few days, the food options can seem limited",
        "could have stayed longer",
        "The Maguro restaurant was fine the first time we went, but the service and quality of the food the second time was dreadful: my daughter and I could hardly eat one bite of our meal as all is seemed to be was fat, and trying to get the attention of our waiter was near impossible after a couple of Asian families came in",

        "Price was acceptable and easy exchange any time with good",
        "The elegant pavilions, combined with traditional Balinese architecture and extensive grounds mean you can always find a quiet spot to relax and although the loungers by the pool are often reserved with towels by breakfast, there are plenty of loungers under shady umbrellas a minute away on the beach or by the stunning lap pool near the spa and tennis courts",
        "When I reached the hotel, one of the attendant took a bag and disappeared",
        "Aside from this the facilities are very good, the kids club is tiny with quite boring and limited activities and from looking at nearby hotels their clubs seems much bigger and more fun, but the pool area was fantastic with a huge sandbank area for kids to play in and plenty of communal toys provided for kids of all ages",
        "Yet, on returning this week with my husband I can still only give this hotel 4 stars because there are two many lapses in staff professionalism and the F&B offerings in the Palace Club fall short of what one expects from a 5-star hotel in Nusa Dua given the competition",

        "Every little extra had been thought of in the access rooms with wide doorways, lower furniture, great walk in shower and fold out cushioned shower chair",
        "The attached beach at the back of the resort, just past the swimming pool, is almost private and one can stroll along it for miles",
        "You are limited to the resorts so prices are a little more",
        "Therefore only 3 stars",
        "Came back at 230pm, the room still not ready",
        "Given free massage and T-shirts as consolation",
        "The only downside was the smell in the bathroom and the little bugs all over the rattan table in our room",

        "The room, staff, pool and beach were all exactly as we had hoped and for a honeymoon couple who didn't want the stress of haggling and travelling about it was perfect",
        "Free wifi is limited to the lobby area, but there are plenty of couches and seating for you to take your time fulfilling your online obligations",
        "Not enough local dishes, overall have no enough choice!",
        "Staff are friendly but some should smile more ilke other 5* hotel in Bali",
        "etc the staff is very friendly and cooperative",
        "The attention to detail is extraordinary throughout the whole resort",
        "They do serve 3 different types of dishes every day, but probably my expectation on this is too high",
        "We also would not eat at the restaruant again mainly as it is far too hot the fans are totally inadequate to be of any use",
        "On our first day the hotel was quite crowded but this was because it was \"Silence Day\" in Bali and no one was allowed to leave the grounds of the hotel",
        "Our first holiday as a family with our three and a half month old son",
        "Drinks aren't cheap but you are staying at a resort so expect to pay resort prices",
        "So much food to choose from",
        "As soon as one came out of airport warm & humid typical tropical air welcomes you, which",
        "my choice was limited to hotels in nusadua & kuta areas",
        "Went on holidays from Costa Rica to Bali with just a lot expectations",
        "We wanted to stay in the Nusa Dua area and this one seemed to be one of the better value for money ones",
        "The staff at breakfast operated on auto pilot and were very robotic - no interest in making you feel welcome",
        "(Palace Club DEFINATELY worth the extra cost!)",
        "Everyone warns about changing money in Bali, and I was a little disappointed that the bank within the resort did try to short change me! So be mindful of this!! Also the taxi service is a lot more expensive from the resort, just pop outside the gates and grab yourself a bluebird cab!",
        "The pools are clean & huge, the waters are warm & delightful",
        "Massages were available in the spa of the hotel or more basic / cheaper option was available on the beach",
        "The room had problems - first the air conditioner thermostat was busted, so one part of the room was super cold and the other was warm",
        "So much choice",
        "I loved shopping through here except beware of the two fellows giving you tickets to win a prize",
        "One was the Business Centre",
        "The other was the small choice of wine on the menu and the huge cost to buy a bottle of wine",
        "Also, try to get a special package / deal",
        "On most other nights we would catch the shuttle bus to Bali Collection where there is many choices to eat at very reasonable prices also a supermarket for stocking up on drinks and snacks",
        "The hotel breakfast meats are pork free",
        "Definitely worth paying the small amount extra",
        "Smaller and quieter than most family resorts which is great and although Nusa Dua is generally quieter than Kuta & Legian and a bit tucked away, the free shuttle to Bali Collection every hour from 10am to 10pm ,shopping and restaurants are very convenient to access",
        "However, two gripes: the food inhouse is generally unremarkable",
        "Very good value for money",
        "Heard the odd grumble about prices in the restaurants and bars - frankly, if you want this level of service, surroundings and safety, there is a price to be paid",
        "The spa is amazing, and open 16 hours a day,also adults only, so a very peaceful place,there are also three other pools to choose from,one with a swim up bar",
        "Stayed at a couple of places in Bali and would definitely recommend this one",
        "Other gripes:",
        "Biggest downside which probably stopped me giving 5 marks was the bathroom",
        "One other downside would be the Wi Fi coverage only being available in the lobby",
        "Perhaps this is the usual amongst all the resorts but still found it quite a pain for a resort of this size",
        "I'm being picky but the bathroom situation, wifi availability and perhaps lack of too many local decent dining experiences stops me from giving 5 out of 5",
        "The other one has a depth of 2",
        "talk about a surprise! when i came to relaize the prices vs",
        "Booking in and out was quick and efficient",

        "The resort was very clean and the attention to the little detalis were great",
        "There was plenty of space for bags",
        "Paying the extra for a palace club room was good value, especially as food & alcohol in particular was expensive for Bali",
        "Only a cheap taxi ride from the airport, $7-8 depending on the traffic so don't worry about per booking transfers",
        "Free WI FI Internet, lovely pools and great buffett breakfast",
        "The staff at this hotel very always very friendly and helpful, without exception",
        "just returned home last night, we spent 4 lovely relaxing days at the hotel, there was enough for everyone to do, my older son (13) went wind surfing, played volley ball, swam, played ping pong, squash, billiards, we couldnt of asked for more, our youngest just swam all day! at night its just a short stroll to some lovely restaurants if you dont want to eat at the hotel, we did do one night where there was traditional dances and baba guling, soooo delicious",
        "The beach was beautiful, the only downside was so much seaweed!",
        "quiet area, walking distance to shops and restaurants although plenty to choose from within resort,",
        "Its a big beach property",
        "There are 3 pools:one has a bar, one has a volleyball net, and the 3rd a basket ball thingy",
        "No one likes to go to the toilet slipping on tiles and squelching on a oversaturated bath towel mat",
        "At any one time there were maybe one or two kids there",
        "Spacey and plenty of options to choose for",
        "Also its open area and hence no aircon",
        "Some of the issues encountered: booking only recognized by the supervisor after a long discussion, insisting cleaning staff despite the not disturb sign on the door, poorly managed restaurant (eg",
        "There is an amazing gym,tennis courts etc",
        "Very good spa,tennis,squash and a small fitness",
        "The only let down is the level of service almost stay in the mid of 80s or 90s",
        "We came to hotel without making booking and friendly bellboy help us with our luggage to reception desk",
        "The food options and quality were amazing",
        "If you want to stay in a quiet place with private beach, pools and cocktails within a reasonable price, this one is perfect",
        "They feed right from your fingers and some even jump on the pond's ledge",
        "Big garden",
        "after spending 3 nights in ubud (which was not bad at all) one would certainly be swept away with the massive and elegant layout of this resort",
        "Would recommend for those wish to rest and relax, or honeymoon couple",
        "The hotel is nice and clean with many helpful and friendly staff and there is plenty of security about",
        "With a 5 star resort comes 5 star prices",
        "A few suggestions:",
        "Just right for the little ones",
        "Good breakfast with lots of choices",
        "Cost back to hotel in a meter taxi was roughly $3",
        "All our our money, jewellery and passports were there",
        "The hotel provide free afternoon tea to guests of Palace Club but the choice is somehow limited",
        "AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",
        "The only other downside we found was the wifi only being available in the lobby",
        "Fewer trees and less vegetation in general in the courtyard than in the other two",
        "This was an outstanding holidays my wife and I really relaxed in a setting surrounded by an extremely friendly, competent and professional staff, the rooms are all excellent size and very clean, actually spotless with all amenities, it is our point of view that the value for money is also excellent",
        "And therefore the prices are higher",
        "Great value for money! The only drawback is the location which is a little bit far from all the sites but at least is in a very quiet and safe area where all the big hotels are",
        "We organised our entire wedding over the internet with their wedding planner Kadek and everything was perfect not one hiccup",
        "but theat hear say, facitilities are clean, nice, price is high too",
        "We have stayed at resorts on several occasions now and this one is up with best of them",
        "went to Bali Collection for dinners, but prices were'nt astronomically high",
        "A great deal of care and attention goes into the room service",
        "Once you are at Bali Collection, there are plenty of options to eat at a third of the price of the hotel",
        "An excellent service well worth the additional monies",
        "The downside from the hotel - Breakfast is defiantly less than average",
        "very expensive tours i",
        "Bargaining is pathetic",
        "Although we reported it no one came to fix it",
        "However, the prices of these restaurants are expensive comparing local standards",
        "Within the resort there is also a spa and personally had not tried the spa packages here as the prices are more expensive",
        "The only problem I had with this hotel was when we checked in to this hotel the reception staff checked you in and that was it no one explained the layout of the hotel or directed you to the breakfast area",
        "There were plenty of shops outside the hotel to buy drinks and other items from",
        "This is one of the last real Balinese hotels with huge open lobby and all the restaurants are open so one can enjoy the amazing gardens, pools and beach",
        "Expect similar standard but at half the price",
        "Our boys had a ball Jetskiing and the prices here can vary down the beach",
        "The daily charge for room internet is outrageous",
        "There are better choices for this price range and this location (in Nusa Dua)",
        "My only surprise at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was on checking out",
        "The hotel seemed to have kept the Balinese feel with a modern touch with all the facilities advertised and the price was affordable for a 4 star hotel",
        "His real name is Wayan but as you will see there are a few so ask for John",
        "And for me this is a put off, less practical, wasting time, spend more for transport, and get off from, no offense to the locals, two stars places",
        "Still, would like to note a couple of things",
        "Cheap to book as we got a great deal, good excellent staff",
        "(Note: Nusa Dua was very quiet in general, so the lack of crowds was not a reflection of the hotel",
        "I thought the breakfast was really good considering it is included, agree that the other restaurant meals are expensive (especially since i have now traveled to other parts of the island) and it is not that motivating to go off site since everything close by is likely as expensive",
        "Well arranged pick up",
        "Internet & wi fi not free",
        "I have been reading other reviews on Trip Advisor since March of this year and a number of people have complained about the pricing of food and drinks at the hotel and commented that one can eat cheaper outside the hotel",
        "If you are looking for food only, then by all means dine outside, but if you appreciate quality of food and service, then what the hotel is offering is extremely good value for money",
        "not cheap but really value for your money",
        "We had read a lot of Trip Advisor reviews about the hotel restaurants and bars being too expensive so were ready to go out for most meals, but when we arrived we found that the prices were more than reasonable",
        "Didnt think it was worth the money",
        "The staff at the Chess restaurant couldn't have made more of a fuss of them, nothing was too much bother",
        "But so are all hotels, so wasn't any surprise to us",
        "Food especially the shrimp",
        "So it is indeed much warmer",
        "Couldn't pick up so many of them, and so got it from the other stack",
        "Last one is the middle area between rear stairs and pool is dark, unused, and seem like a waste",
        "One suggestion for the hotel management, please give free room upgrade like in Melia and Marriot, customers enjoy it and will come for more",
        "Sometimes with friends and kids, sometimes as a couple",
        "Some of the newly renovated rooms are becoming more westernised but still very nice",
        "I think those few who would say different are either sour with life or don't know how to treat people respectfully",
        "And if you want to explore the transport is so inexpensive that any one can afford it",
        "However the price of food and drink is ridiculous",
        "Great restaurants with a great atmosphere at a fraction of the cost",
        "Overall, a great choice as long as you don't expect to stay on site for your meals!",
        "Hotel shop prices were 3 times the price of local shopping area",
        "The price for food and drink was exceptionally expensive",
        "Only downside was the walk to the main lobby and pool areas was around 10 mins",
        "The hotel is located on a strip including the Westin and Laguna, both are very nice properties and having stayed at both are a step up from Nusa Dua beach hotel but do cost more as well",
        "At aud$75",
        "Well worth the extra few dollars",
        "But the cost of providing wifi to all guests would be very expensive",
        "The choice of drink included: champagne, martinis, frozen daiquiris etc",
        "The bed was very comfortable however a couple of the pillows were rather hard for myself and my fiance",
        "The hotel in reality has two major swimming pools, both of which are very nice, very clean and very easy to access and were rarely busy during our stay in the first week of Australian school holidays, the Main Pool has a swim-up bar which unfortunately was quite expensive and in some cases prices were higher than Australia after Tax and Service Charge",
        "It's a shame as they had many vacancies and still have - I booked a Superior and they still have plenty of Palace Club Suites available",
        "An early booking is always recommended to keep the wallet light :)",
        "there were plenty of pools to chill by",
        "The value for money was the best",
        "So many of the other resorts only make a passing nod to Indonesia",
        "There was an outstanding selection of restaurants for dinner and lunch still the prices were a bit on the high side",
        "There are also plenty of restaurants to choose plus outside the entry to the Nusa Dua Resorts is also a small village with a market atmosphere with local restaurant options",
        "The Hotel's biggest asset is the staff",
        "Our only complaint, also shared by many other guests, was the remodeled shower",
        "There are plenty of sun lounges around and ample shade",
        "Not that big, especially not the bathroom",
        ", One of the best things about this hotel was the friendly staff",
        "he went above and beyond in answering our questions and concerns and made some great recommendations for restaurants (Bambu Bali",
        "If you go with your family and children to Nusa Dua their high prices can ruin you quickly",
        "The package we arranged for the trip through a travel agent was very reasonable",
        "The service was generally friendly and efficient, but was somewhat disjointed at times, possibly because some of the staff were somewhat limited in English",
        "I highly recommend the Palace Club, and compared to other resorts, probaly the most affordable club on offer",
        "It was a great value, as some of the other newer hotels down the beach were almost double! The staff was incredible in so many ways!",
        "Booked a suite in the palace club section and well worth the extra expense",
        "Our only gripe with the room was the vast cabinet used to house the CRT TV set",
        "A good sized sink and mirror",
        "However quite expensive, best deal is to have the half board",
        "There is a well lit pathway, if you turn left you will come accross a little restuarant and bar called Kendi Kuning, it's about 10 -15 minutes walk, but you can get a cab, the food there is excellent and really good value, the drinks too are much cheaper than the hotel",
        "huge swimming pool",
        "What i liked least is to go to the main town",
        "Breakfast, evening snacks, and all day beverage provided",
        "Prefer the first one",
        "All in all a very nice to place to stay and very good value for the money",
        "- an extremely expensive place with low value for money",
        "- transfer should've also been included in a high class hotel",
        "My friend and I booked this hotel through a Asia Luxe tour package",
        "The hotel was right on the beach, where there were plenty of chairs and towels",
        "Booked hotel through Expedia",
        "Ornate fountains both inside and outside",
        "The kids visited the kids club for a few hours and had a ball there are plenty of organised activities",

        "but pricey",
        "Both very well run and good value for money",
        "Nothing too much trouble",
        "Very nice rooms with great outlook",
        "Our room was on the ground floor so we had a patio that lead to the near pond, where there was plenty of wild life!",
        "This is a nice walk from the hotel along the beach, or there is a free transfer available from most hotels",
        "There were hundreds of gemstones and silver beads to choose from",
        "But being in a resort specific area of Bali the prices of everything were pretty inflated",
        "Awesome if your looking to just relax and don't mind paying a premium",
        "I love the surroundings, very artistic and detailed like the spotlight was hidden inside a toad (stone carved)",
        "They restaurants on resort are more expensive, but they are beautiful and one offers entertainment on certain nights",
        "I think our total dinner cost us $13 with one beer and one soda! And it was really great! I think I had shrimp with pasta in a vodka sauce!",
        "Many of the other hotels are new",

        "We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort for 10days with a group of 30 family and friends, many of us also have small toddlers",
        "Both were fantastic",
        "Its big, well decorated and nice secure location",
        "With pampering, romatic dinners and lounging by the pool in mind, our choice fell on the Nusa Dua area",
        "We also soon discovered that prices in Nusa Dua, whether it be spa facilities, restaurants or even drinks, were generally higher than elsewhere on the island",
        "One of the best bits for us was the spa",
        "Also a steam room, plunge pool, day bed and complete privacy",
        "The best choice was the Kendi Kuning Beach Restaurant immediately after the Club Mediterranee",
        "This hotel really lived up to our expectations",
        "Truly good and also very good value for money",
        "We chose to stay here over many others based on the excellent reviews on this website, unfortunately it seems our expectations are higher than some other reviewers",

        "All our expectations were met and beyond",

        "there's more of a selection of souvenirs etc",
        "the cars and guides provided were fanastic",
        "Walking along the beach in the evening we noticed that some of the neighbouring hotels were livelier in terms of night life, but we actually preferred the Nusa Dua for being quiet",
        "any of the other hotels in Nusa Dua strip where the beach access is cramped and the pool not so expansive",
        "The staff are mostly friendly, helpful and efficient, so the service level is great",
        "Breakfast is the usual buffet and while it doesn't vary greatly, there are ample choices",
        "more of that later) and we had a fantastic view of the sea and the hotel",
        "The other rooms which the rest of our party booked were lovely as well and no one had any complaints",
        "We booked the Royal wedding package and all I can say it was amazing in every way from the 3",
        "swimming pool etc",
        "If you pay the bill in cash (who does) change currency out side as the US$ published on the hotel site is converted to Rupiah for the bill",
        "Both are a good size",
        "The pool bar service is hit and miss- sometimes efficient and at times non existent",
        "The choice was average",
        "(See above for better option)",
        "Matahari department store is very good- clothing, shoes, bags, jewellery, gifts etc with fixed prices",
        "Go elsewhere",
        "All in all well worth the money",
        "The only let down at all these resorts are the toasters are so slow",
        "Rooms: We were lucky enough to have an upgrade so got a double room (two rooms with a door cut out in between), when there were only two of us",
        "Though the staff was friendly, many didn't speak English very well",
        "and outside of the hotel, it can be difficult to exchange your money for the best rate if your money is bent, wrinkled or torn a bit (very surprising!!)",
        "It was just nice and refreshing to be in a resort not full of Brits!! (went to maldives last year and was like a little butlins!! lol)",
        "One was a regular type from the wall and the second one was allowed you to sit down in (if you wanted), truly amazing and very big and roomy",
        "We were shown another room which was exactly the same and were told our only option was to upgrade to a Palace Club Suite for an extra $100 a night",
        "The lifts are dodgy to say the least and the doors slammed shut on me once and bruised both of my arms",
        "Our Thomas Cook rep Kasna was very nice and helpful and arranged some very good trips for us at reasonable prices",
        "Most of the rooms have a balcony with great tropical, either garden or sea views",
        "You get your breakfast in a separate area in such a a peaceful and beautiful setting and you will also get evening drinks and nibbles included in your price",
        "Food - we didnt eat in the 'main' restauant at all, as there are some many smaller, speciallty ones",
        "There are also so many rooms that one could feel lost in the hotel",
        "Nusa Dua is nice, but if you're expecting to do watersports, most the interesting stuff is 4km down the road from these hotels",
        "There's plenty of places outside to eat for 1/3rd the cost of the hotel, and just as good",
        "On the negative side, some of the hotel's facilities are rather old",
        "Pizzas covered in raw garlic (which we could not see because one has to eat in darkness)",
        "We had a wander into and around many of the hotels during our stay and this one is the best by far",
        "Many of the other hotels we had a sticky beak at seemed to miss the point that you were in Bali - some were very bland and westernised",
        "What a nice surprise to find that the pictures don't do this place justice and the staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful",
        "Breakfast buffett was very expansive and had lots of different choices each day",
        "CONS (for some):",
        "Overall you get a fair value for the price",
        "However, since the hotel still has the label as being one of the \"leading hotels of the world\", expectations need to be setted right:",
        "For this the whole facility is too dated, the food variance and sophistication is too little and just many view little things",
        "We did find that some tourist attractions had lots of traders and some were quite persistent",
        "Flying half the way round the world to spend 2 weeks with lots of posing silicone enhanced sunbathers in what is really nothing more than a disneyworld of a hotel is not for me, but our travel agent sold it to us as part of a larger package",
        "Tropical in particular was excellent value with lovely food",
        "The last option will be laying down on the beach there",
        "Prices for spa, meals and drinks etc are expensive",
        "Even snorkles etc have to be hired too",
        "The hotel felt crowded and there was an early morning race to try and get a sunbed (many failed as not enough)",
        "Only downside was wetter",
        "We also found that you have to get up REALLY early to reserve a sunbed, many are already taken by 7",
        "and the prices were affordable",
        "The Palace Club is well worth the upgrade and the satff are",
        "I stayed there for 9 nights and on their defence maybe my expectations were too high",
        "At Palace Club level the general choice of food was fine but somewhat disappointing at cocktail hour",
        "The hotel is located on a peninsula with several other major resorts (many of which appeared to be nicer)",
        "One needs to take a taxi ride (about 12 bucks or so) to get to the other areas like Kuta or Seminyak",
        "It is evident that the administration is working very hard to make each and everyone comfortable and contented",
        "Otherwise it is one fantastic hotel with best value for money",
        "Prices to match",
        "There are plenty of options for lying in the sun - round the pools, in the gardens, or on the beach - the choice is yours",
        "We had our breakfast in the Main open air Restaurant overlooking the shaped lilyponds, and the choice was overwhelming",
        "Some of the hotel areas do indicate the age of the hotel",
        "If the hotel were to be fully booked, one would have to run 'the German way' each morning to get a spot beside the pool",
        "But, if you can spend a little, and are keen on visiting this touristic part of Bali, one could recommand other hotels in the neighbourhood, such as f",
        "You felt like you were in Bali and not anywhere in the world which some of the other hotels seemed to appear as",
        "But for the rest, what a disappointment!",
        "Its also a bit out of the way - 2-way taxi to Ubud costs 300,000 rupiah"

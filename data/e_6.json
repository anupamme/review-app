From the pick up at the airport from the hotel which l would suggest as their is a lot of construction going on and negotiating the terminal can be tricky for newcomers, to the check in process at reception it all went like clockwork. Our room was great, very spacious. Not a big fan of the overhead shower and trying to close the shower door was interesting as there is no inside handle. Aircon worked well and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast had a huge variety and lovely position looking out to the gardens. One pool was closed while we were there but we never had any trouble finding somewhere in the shade to sit. Had dinner one night at their Chess restaurant which is right on the beach, l had Mie Goreng, it was excellent. Bali Collection has an hourly shuttle bus where you can pick up some groceries, shop at Sogo (Japanese Department store) there is also a chemist, bookshop and lots of restaurants. Cost back to hotel in a meter taxi was roughly $3.00 AUS if you don't want to wait for the next shuttle. We would recomend the Nusa Dua Cafe for dinner which is just inside the gates of Nusa Dua, $30.00 for dinner, drinks and a magic show! Also, for water sports go to Bali Jet Set, diving with them is amazing, very professional outfit. Would definitely stay here again, can't wait for our next trip back.\n", "\nI stayed 2 nights in Nusa Dua, and enjoyed almost everything. It's probably close to perfect if you are looking for a nice peaceful place to stay and relax, enjoy the beach, pool, spa etc. The evening entertainment is limited, but most people probably are not looking for that anyway. The breakfast buffet is excellent, with a large selection. The restaurants on site are so-so, not quite up to the level that could be expected, especially the one closest to the beach serving rather bland (and expensive) poorly prepared curries and other things. The Italian style restaurant by the pool was much better. The pool is excellent, and the spa services also, even if a bit expensive. While there we did a one day trip to Ubud (temples, monkey park, handicrafts, market), which was really nice, and should be considered a \"must\".\n", "\nWe visit Bali each year around the time of our wedding anniversary.

The Duty Manager explained that the person cleaning our room had found our safe unlocked and open - he walked back to the room with us to check all was well - it was. All our our money, jewellery and passports were there. The honesty of the staff is to be commended.

Of all the power points in the room, 1 worked. Our 'double' bed was 2 single beds pushed together, which we promptly fell through during the night. When my partner complained to the Manager, she was offered a free 1hr massage. So apparently management feels as though it's acceptable for their customers to pay for these 'services'. We were not offered a change of room (I think I worked out why after speaking with other guests who were also suffering the same circumstances as ourselves). So after contacting the management 2 more times no resolution was forthcoming, sorry, that's not quite true. After I had paid for the entire bill, we were offered 50% off our next stay there!!

On the back of the swim up bar is the kids pool, which means you can be having a beer watching your little ones!", "When we were there the hotel was about 50% occupancy, which resulted in there not being other kids there, as a result of this our kids didn't use the kids club until late in our stay when another child was there for them to play with.

Drinks were well priced throughout the hotel, and babysitters are available (something we didn't make use of enough).", "Of course staying in Nusa Dua means the traffic to and from other destinations can be a pain, but that relates to the location, not this hotel specifically.

Lots of carved wood, stonework, and even an outdoor cultural theater in the center of the courtyard, featuring an almost-recreation of a Hjndu Temple. The Westin and Laguna seem a lot more luxurious; however with the exception of the open lobby areas and some cosmetic touches here and there, they feel like more typical luxury hotels. Nusa Dua has way more character.", "The character comes at a cost, however. The big theater and garden area at Nusa Dua mean the pools are quite a bit smaller than the Westin and Laguna. Fewer trees and less vegetation in general in the courtyard than in the other two. ", "I had a ground-floor room opening out onto the pool area. The room was large and pretty posh, with lots of woodwork and sliding plantation shutters inside the sliding glass/wood doors to the outside.

Several outdoor restaurants including one on the beach. Expensive, but I guess you would expect that at a resort.", "If you are a runner: Bali is HOT. There's a great path along the beach that runs along all of the resorts. You can get several miles in within the Nusa Dua area without too much trouble, although it can be a bit tricky to follow it around a few places where it appears to end at fences or buildings. The Westin actually does a guided run at 7:30 am so if you find your way there, that's a big help: they have a mapped-out 5K or 8K loop they will show you--then you can do it on your own earlier in the morning when it's cooler.", "All-in-all, I'd recommend this place, unless you know you'd rather have a more modern environment with less character.\n", "\nArrived at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for the last three days of our ten day holiday for total rest and relaxation.", "It is one of the most beautiful hotels in Nusa Dua,this was our second stay and again it was fantastic from rooms to staff and service.", "The beach and pools are great with many sunbeds available.", "Food and drinks were very good and not as expensive as we imagined.", "This is a great hotel for couples wanting to have some lovely time together.\n", "\nIf you are a fan of large beach resorts you'll probably love this place.

We also ate quite a few meals at the hotel as there aren't alot of other dining options around, apart from at the neighbouring hotels on the beach or at Bali Collection.

I also looked at the Melia hotel, which is about 3 hotels down on the same beach strip but was glad we didn't stay there - it had more of a big hotel vibe - loud music, large tour groups, pushy staff and watered down cocktails (we went there for happy hour one day).

The others have tired room, and some have newly design room, but they don't replace the bed yet. So disappointment start when you're in the bed. The aircon works perfectly. If you travel with kids, this hotel has many kids pool and has sandy pool as well. M has only one pool for kids and no sandy pool is available. Affordable kids menu are available for room service. The rooms close to the pool and Gecko is very convenient. For me, all these justify the higher rate.", "Downside: some old workers seem bit too tired to service.

The food at the resort is great and the breakfasts are probably the best i have had in Bali. My husband and I always make sure that we go back here each time we visit Bali for Lunch or Dinner. Although in saying this when we stayed we paid $150 AUD per night for a deluxe room which is now around $236 per night. I know that they have done renovations but I don't think it makes the rooms an extra $86 per night, but this is only my opinion. I would not pay what they ask now.

Hopefully at future they could fix this problem and we could enjoy also at Hotel bars, sounds funny problem, but all people doesnt like mixed cocktails and martini jokes.

The rooms was nice, comfortable and clean but not as nice as I had expected for a five star resort. ", "The pools were lovely and great for our young son to play in. The beach is clean (for Bali) but the water is still pretty polluted (the beach is clean because the rubbish is cleaned by hotel staff throughout the day but check out all of the debris on the rocks when the tide goes out for a true picture of how clean the water is).", "The buffet breakfast selection and quality was pretty average. There was an egg station for omlettes and fried eggs and then buffet fried bacon, ham, sausages, hash browns, grilled tomato together with an Asian style breakfast selection, pastries, toast, fruit and salad. ", "Our greatest issue was probably the cost of actually being at the resort. The food and drinks were really expensive and it was hard to get out of the hotel. The hotel adds 21% tax and service to all food and drinks which is pretty strandard but when the prices are high to start with the tab gets pretty large pretty quickly. We were not overly impressed by the quality of the food and a soft drink or a water was almost $5AUD with tax and service. Further, the hotel makes it hard to get away as there are no taxis or other transport at the door like you would find at places in Bali other than Nusa Dua. We figured out pretty quickly that it only takes about 15 minutes to walk to Bali Collection (via the beach, which is mostly shaded along the path connecting all of the hotels) or you can catch the free shuttle (but this does not operate at lunch or dinner time!). Once you are at Bali Collection, there are plenty of options to eat at a third of the price of the hotel. Most of the restaurants will collect you and drop you back to your hotel for free (if you can plan this in advance or call them if you know where you want to eat). There is also a restaurant if you walk in the opposite direction to Bali Collection (from the hotel along the beach), Kendi Kuning. The path is covered in sand for about 100 metres, which makes it a hard slog with a stroller, but then the restaurant is just past Club Med (i.e. about 10 minutes from the hotel but not as much shade if you go in the day).", "You can get a driver from around Bali Collection for $20 - $30 AUD a day or a metered taxi for shorter trips (the hotel charges a flat rate of about 50,000rp to get transport to the Nusa Dua area, say Bali Collection, whereas a metered taxi will be about 12,000rp). If you walk just past the security for the hotel there are drivers waiting who will take you anywhere you want to go.", "The laundry service at the hotel was also really expensive. We walked down to the markets at the entrance to Nusa Dua and dropped our laundry at the \"Oriental Day Spa\". They did our washing for 2000Rp per piece (about 20 cents) which worked out less than 10% what the hotel charges.", "A massage at the hotel will set you back about $90AUD. If you go to Bali Collection you can get a massage for about $30AUD and if you go to the markets you can get one for about $6AUD. Obviously the massage at the markets is not as lush as the one at the hotel's day spa but they are pretty good all the same, particularly if you take your own scented oil (i.e. the rooms are private, clean and air conditioned).\n", "\nA conference at the nearby conference centre brought me to this hotel.", "Right from the well organized pick up at the very busy airport in Bali, I knew that this hotel was going to be special - it was only very disappointing not to have shared my experiences with my wife!", "Tranquility was high on my radar and after a quick and pleasant check in I was shown to my room which was on the second level.", "The next morning the view across the gardens to the small lakes was very pleasing.

At the first night, I stayed at the deluxe room. it's a nice and clean room, but I found the A/C not as cold as I want it to be, so I reported it and the technician came. The next day, they asked me again about the A/C. Actually the A/C were working, but not that cold in the daytime, at night I still can slept well. But they want to make sure their guests feel comfortable, so they offered me a room upgrade to the premium room. They took care their guests very well. The breakfast was just OK, but I love the surrounding of the restaurant, they have a beautiful and big fish pond. Great swimming pool and beach.

My highlights were the beautiful spa and its private pool area, 2 hour cooking class with the head chef of 20 years, the traditional dance show in the hotels theatre and the fabulous cocktails in the lobby bar.

Although we reported it no one came to fix it. Breakfast was also great but can get very busy,make sure you go early or late but not around 9:30 as it gets a little chaotic.

I love the character of the place, elegant and refined, tastefully luxurious while still retaining the character and context of the place. I only had a few days in Bali and I wanted to make the most of my time there. The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is fantastic. Open and airy and you really get the feel of the place you are in. I didn't want to stay at a sterile five star resort which could be anywhere (Hawaii, CA, etc.). This place is decorated in traditional Balinese style and you really feel you are away from it all. It is huge, with lovely gardens and lily ponds. The pool is fantastic and the spa is great, with its own quiet pool and complimentary use of the sauna, hot tub and steam room facilities. My only complaint about this hotel was that it was just a bit too quiet. They should have some live entertainment at night, a band or lounge singer. Food was excellent and service first rate.

On arrival I was greeted with a welcome drink and cool towel, extremely efficient check in and shown to my room. The hotel is quite a walk to the village so I would use this more for a few days beachside / poolside break rather than a base to see and explore everything that Bali has to offer. The rooms are very large with balconies (although mine did not have a bath) and again the rooms mix old with new, the roof had a traditional balinese painting, but yet did not scrimp on modern comforts. There are mutilple restaurants and bars, and with the Westin etc next door if you get tired of the hotel cuisine, walk for 30 seconds on the beach and try somewhere else. Wifi is free in the lobby area but charged in the rooms (I just don't get this) and the bar next to the lobby has a great afternoon tea and happy hour, it is very chic and modern. The complex is huge and the pool is large (although quite a distance from alot of the rooms so ask for a room close to the pool, this will also enable better beach views). The spa is exceptional, offers multiple treatments and honestly could not be faulted ... although on the beach to the left of the hotel are a group of ladies that will offer massages on the beach ... I asked to be massaged on the little hut at the end of a pier thingy (sorry do not know technical term) it only accomodates 1 person or a couple and you feel like you are in the middle of the ocean, the massage was extraordinary and a bargain price ... do try it. The staff at the hotel are super friendly and accomodating.

The beds were comfortable and each room comes with a flat screen TV with alot of international channels. Both of our rooms came with a balcony that overlooked the pool and garden area which was great. Bathrooms came with rainforest shower facility. ", "There were a number of international restaurants located within the resort. Its alos a short walk to other 5 stars international hotesl and resorts located just beside ours. To our left are Club Med and Conrad and to our right; westin and laguna. So there were no shortage of eateries. However, the prices of these restaurants are expensive comparing local standards. Within Nusa Dua Beach hotel, there is a restaurant by the beach named \"Chess\" and there is live music during the evening. The atmosphere and ambience is simply romantic. ", "The hotel itself has a large swimming pool that caters to different groups of users like children. There is a bar in the middle of the pool as well if you may need a drink while swimming. Within the resort there is also a spa and personally had not tried the spa packages here as the prices are more expensive.", "Walking to the private beach from the hotel is just 5 minutes. The beach is clean with crystal clear waters. The resort does maintain the beach pretty well.", "Overall, this resort is one of the best, if not the best that i had ever stayed.\n", "\nWe arrived Denpasar Mon 13 Feb after a 6 hr Virgin flight from Brisbane. Met on arrival by hotel staff, and whisked off by private car to the very luxxy Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa \u2013 a great choice of hotel \u2013 which is right on beach (not any roads to cross) and located in a beaut area where the royalty stay - it's way, way up on grubby Kuta. One of the most courteous and efficient check ins ever and a terrific spacious 'Premium' room, overlooking pool, gardens and beach. Excellent facilities, Free WiFi around lobby area. Had a couple of beers at the bar by the beach (where they do a happy hour pizza for next to nix) and then a magnificent dinner right on the beach with a brilliant young guitarist setting the atmosphere. We would come here again, but not to Kuta.\n", "\nMy husband and I stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa in Bali on February 15-17th, 2012. We enjoyed the comforts of the Palace Club where we checked-in and were given an upgrade to a honeymoon suite. The Palace Club privileges include the the club lounge where our breakfast, High Tea, and evening cocktails were served and free internet was available 24 hours per day. The courtyard was amazingly lush and finely manicured. The honeymoon suite is huge and luxurious with a dining room (including a cappuccino maker), living room, bedroom, bathroom, and powder room, with a furnished double balcony. Raw fruit, although available at the Palace Club is replenished in the room every couple of days.", "Staff take a great deal of pride in their work and really can\u2019t do enough to ensure your comfort and meet your needs. They frequently ask you by name, if they can get you anything else and are very accommodating if you are unable to enjoy the snacks during designated times. Also, they remember how you like things and in offering, do so in that manner (eg would you like your soy latte with sweetener today). These kinds of things express how warmly you are welcome. ", "Staff are also very respectful of wildlife around the hotel. For instance, the gaggle of geese, who are quite domesticated, drop round the club several times daily honking loudly for bread crumbs from their own personal \u201cstash\u201d. The fish and turtles are all so very healthy looking.", "The beachfront is furnished with comfortable lounge chairs and there is never a shortage of luxurious purple beach towels. The grounds are full of superbly manicured detail whether it is foliage or terraces between floors and the whole place is truly spotless.", "A turndown service is provided every night with slippers being set out beside the bed on slipper mats and a refresh of the room is done; emptying garbage, replenishing water, etc. The rooms really are kept in immaculate condition.", "The fitness facilities have an incredible selection of cardio and core training equipment. But we found the room to be a bit busy for our liking and there wasn\u2019t much free space. Jogging every morning along what seemed like an endless beachfront trail provided more than enough exercise. There was also a full roster of activities at the fitness centre and the beach to keep everyone active, some of them with an additional cost such as the bike tour.", "If I return to Bali one day, and I hope I do, I\u2019ll surely stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa again!\n", "\nStayed for a week in January and had a fantastic time. Staff were friendly, the room and grounds were simply beautiful!!!", "lovely time had by all\n", "\nHave just returned from 5 night stay. We had booked a Palace Club Room with use of the Palace Club, but were upgraded to a Palace Club Suite on Level 4 overlooking private garden area. Check in and out was excellent at the Palace Club. Evening cocktails was very good but a bit of trap as after a few canapes we generally didn't go and have a meal. Breakfast at Palace Club was simple and sufficient (much better for those of us who can't help overeating at buffet's), although we did go to the main buffet breakfast once and that was a fairly standard buffet for a good hotel. Agree with other comments about Taxis so if you know precisely where you are going, ask the hotel to get you a blue cab. Pools were good but normal problem with greedy self centred tourists who \"reserve\" their poolside lounge first thing in the morning and don't use it till the afternoon. The Pool staff see other inconsiderate guests leave the pool area without returning their towels but don't get off their backsides and collect them and consequently guests don't know if lounges are being used. We would definately go back to this hotel.\n", "\nWe stayed in Nusa Dua for 6 nights we travelled from Ubud and this was the final stay in Bali. The hotel is nice and very comfortbale rooms with all the mod coms. The only problem I had with this hotel was when we checked in to this hotel the reception staff checked you in and that was it no one explained the layout of the hotel or directed you to the breakfast area. It was a case of find everything yourself. I fould this really unusual and odd. The hotel is very big with 3 pools and various restaurants in the hotel. I personally found the hotel far to expensive even cold drinks were priced up to more than 70% profit. We generally liked to take a walk out of the hotel and its not as far as the hotel staff make out to you. There were plenty of shops outside the hotel to buy drinks and other items from. There are also a few massage parlours outside the hotel that offer a good massage for an hour for reasonable prices. ", "The taxis from outside the hotel are easy to find a good vairety of restaurants outside the resort and far much cheaper with a varierty of selections.", "I did enjoy syating at this hotel however I do think the hotel can improve on customer service when it comes to basics.There are alot off staf standing around in the lobby area doing at times just that standing around.", "You have to leave the hotel to see Bali even though the hotel provides everything inside you could be anywhere in the world.\n", "\nI visited the hotel for a week of R&R with my husband. It is probably the best place in Nusa Dua for that kind of vacation. The grounds are splendid. The beach was a very nice surprise, clean lagoon and very spacious white sandy beach. The pool at the spa (which all hotels residents can use) is a delight. Frankly I think the hotel under-sells its grounds. The room - ours was the most basic - was large enough and had a balcony that overlooked a fountain! Breakfast was pretty standard, with decent food choice and quality and the occasional live music entertainment. ", "The disappointment was the staff, hence why I would not rate the hotel 5-star. In short they are running this hotel on the cheap and overcharging for every single bit of extra service not included in the standard package. Examples:", "(1) Each time you ask the concierge service to call you cab they \"assume\" that you mean a hotel cab which costs about USD 5.00 for ten-minute drive. Specify that you want a taxi-metre and the bill drops to USD 1.50! And so it goes for airport transfers etc.... they basically rip you off. We felt very bitter and cheated when we realised that each time you ask them to call you a cab they give you their hotel taxi which charges a ridiculous fare - for the same type of car or driver of a regular taxi!!! I am surprised that nobody has picked up on this", "(2) Cheap staff and it shows. The staff's appearance can be improved in many cases. On many occasions I have noticed that the waiters (and even some receptionist at the front deks) were wearing dirty stained shirts. Many waiters choose not to wear shoes - fair enough - but please could they treat their feet! Part of the lack of energy coming from the staff could also be that they seem to be older than the staff in other hotels around Nusa Dua (eg St Regis, Club Med) and less educated given their level of English. If you are on decaf, be prepared to have to repeat you order at least 3 times to different waiters before they bring it to you! The gala dinner was a let-down for that reason. There was a cultural performnce by some kid dancers, which was quite cute, but totally under-sold and run by totally incompetent staff. I suggest management find out how the competition is doing in this department.\n", "\nFirst time was 21 years ago. It was wonderful in 1991, it is excellent now, 2012. It has recently gone through a renovation and brought up to modern standards. Nusa Dua is still my favorite beach area on Bali, despite some liking Legian. The hotel is in an enclosed and guarded enclave of hotels and shares the long beach with the Westin the Laguna and others. Although each hotel has its own beach area. The beach is maintained non stop and is very clean The waters are warm and visibility quite good. Bali is not a place for diving or snorkeling. ", "The service at the hotel is superb from every single person. The breakfast buffet is huge and excellent. This is one of the last real Balinese hotels with huge open lobby and all the restaurants are open so one can enjoy the amazing gardens, pools and beach. ", "There are three types of rooms. The Deluxe, The premier and the Palace club. We stayed in a premier room only because of the quiet location. All the rooms are good. If you want to splurge get a Palace room on the third floor- room is bigger, but to tell the truth we only saw the room at night.", "We ate at the Chess restaurant, right on the beach, with excellent service", "and very good food. I had the steak and it was delicious.\n", "\nHaving stayed in the Palace Club at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel on many occasions and always loving it, I was slightly disappointed this time around. As always, we spent 3 days in Nusa Dua after a few days in Seminyak. I knew that the rooms at NDBH had been remodelled, so was looking forward to seeing how they looked. After a very warm reception at the Palace Club, I was shown to my room; yes the rooms have been refurnished, but fortunately have kept the Balinese feel that I like. After settling in I headed to the Palace Club for canap\u00e9s and cocktails which are always fabulous; I saw some familiar faces (staff) who also remembered me and made me feel so welcome as always. I discovered that the Palace Club had been extended outside to allow for more tables, and that a small kitchen was now outside too. The canap\u00e9s were always served buffet style prior to this visit, but now they are bought to your table; cold first, then hot. I'm not fond of this system as choice is limited, and I feel that the food was far less enjoyable than it had been on previous occasions, and quality nowhere near as good. The cocktails were still very good and staff so attentive and gracious. Breakfast the next morning was as it had always been with a buffet plus the choice of a cooked item; this was very good. Afternoon tea was served \"English style' on a 3 tier stand, and other than the dry sandwiches, was also good. I really believe that it is the staff at Palace Club that make your stay an enjoyable one, and thank goodness they have remained the same. My only other gripe with the hotel itself is that they seriously need to consider replacing the old brown towels at the spa pool, and perhaps new ones by the main pools also, as they are starting to look quite tatty. When we stayed last January, the spa cafe provided complimentary water by the pool, but this was no longer offered; also, the spa cafe didn't keep regular hours, and no one came around offering snacks or beverages, even though there was only 30% occupancy at the resort. All in all, another good stay, but may try a different hotel next time.\n", "\nOver a ten year period I have stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel on a number of occasions and always find it a great place to relax and just \"chill out\". Normally I have time at Nusa Dua at either at the end or the beginning of a holiday and find that 3 or 4 days is enough. I always try to get a deluxe room on the ground floor overlooking the pool area as I find this the most convenient to everything and you can just walk off the front porch onto the lawn. The rooms are good, clean and functional. The food is great and service excellent - some of the waiters have been there since the hotel opened! The only negative we had was that our room wasn't ready so checkin was delayed which was a negative but I should have gone to the bar and not let it worry me. This time I took a massage session at the Spa - very professional, very relaxing, and excellent surroundings.", "The Hotel itself has a great pool and bar area and the beach in front of the hotel is very nice with lots of sun beds. Good service from beach staff. There are some pleasant walks but if you are looking for shooping etc Nusa Dua is not the place. really you go there for the hotel and the hassle free beaches. At night it is an easy walk to eat or drink at one of the other 4 - 5 star hotels nearby.\n", "\nWe only had 2 days to go on our Bali holiday and after a week at another 5 star resort we decided to relocate finish our holiday at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa.", "I phoned at 9am, was welcomed warmly as a returning quest and checked in at the Palace Wing by 10.30am.", "I am so glad we did. Our previously ordinary holiday at the other resort melted away and we were able to relax and feel we had been on a good restful break.", "Staff make the difference, they efficiently ensure you are able to relax and have the holiday you want. The rooms, grounds, pools and waterfront areas are magnificent too.", "There is no need to leave the resort with all its resturants, but we did visit the local Bali Collection shopping centre for a look around and buy souveniers for the grandchildren.\n", "\nMy husband and I spent 3 nights here after 2 weeks stay in Malaysia as a second trimester pregnancy break. ", "Pros:- The friendliest staff we have ever seen. Always ready to help. Beautifully landscaped grounds and well kept. Truly balinese touch throughout the resort. Rooms are clean. Good cable tv programs included. Adaptors included. Safe and away peaceful, ideal for families.", "Cons: Our room, deluxe room in garden wing, was very small. There was no bathtub and the shower pressure and temperature were not consistent. Food were highly overpriced and of low standard (especially after 2 weeks of Malaysian food). Breakfast variety was good but quality was only average. ", "Fortunately there is an hourly free shuttle to Bali Collection for some shopping and more reasonable food options. Expect similar standard but at half the price. Also, if your visit is during monsoon season, you might want to bring the complimentary umbrella in the room for your Bali collection visit. It is an open air walk from shop to shop. This is also a good place to stock up your bottled water.\n", "\nThis hotel has the perfect location if you are looking for the beach and probably in the safest place in Bali. I thought i knew what friendly staff was, but theese guys take it to the next level. The breakfast is excellent so is the hotell area. Are you planning to eat at the hotel you better bring a lot of money. The food is good but compared to what you can eat just a cab drive away is better and at a fraction of the price. Also why would they charge money for internett usage in the room when its the slowest connection I have ever experianced in a hotel? All in all, i would recommend it.\n", "\nJan 2012, we only stayed 2 nights here and then stayed at a couple of other resorts, from the moment we arrived right through until we left this place was gorgeous. The accommodation we booked was beautiful with rooms well maintained and clean, even the small details such as a clothes line above the bath was included - which was very handy for wet swimmers! The grounds were beautifully kept and huge. We used the gym and squash courts while here which were all well maintained. Breakfast buffet was amazing, have never seen such a variety of food and the quantity was kept up so even if you arrived towards the end of breakfast serving, there was still plenty left. I have to commend the hotel for it's English speaking staff, very fluent and this made the stay so much more pleasant when you could communicate with staff, and they were interested in helping out with questions about Bali and where to go etc. They were all so helpful always, and would always acknowledge their guests all the time with a smile and a hello, throughout the resort. Pool was beautiful and clean and the beach was also nice enough to swim in and warm. Our boys had a ball Jetskiing and the prices here can vary down the beach. Bali Collections is definately the place to eat out in as the restaurants are quite expensive within the resort, there is a shuttle bus each hour to take you there. Even if you miss the bus, a taxi is so cheap as it is only a 10 min walk and a 5 minute drive or thereabouts. We loved it here and would definately stay again. Thank you to Management and Staff.\n", "\nJanuary 3, 2012", "Nusa Dua is much better to stay at than Kuta these days. The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is located on large well kept grounds. It is a big hotel so walking is required. The beach is a good there. The hotel pools are both nice. The pool/bar dining area is in a wonderfull setting right off the beach, making it a special time and place for lunch. The Mee Goring there is incredible, I had it twice. ", "Breakfast buffet is excellent. Dinners were dissapointing. They were expensive but only medium quality for Bali standards. We went to Bali Collection (a shopping center in the area with restuarants) for dinner most nights and there if the food was dissapointing at least we did not overpay.", "The free lobby internet at the hotel proved to be acceptable. The daily charge for room internet is outrageous. ", "Beds were very hard it took one day of little sleep to get used to them. Definately my least favorite part of the hotel. Rooms were large and A/C in January was adequate.", "The spa was great and we went everyday to their pool, hot tub and sauna. The hot tub and sauna are separate for men and women. The workout facility is adequate and they even have squash courts and tennis courts.", "The hotel is a bit far from things so it is not really convenient to other things except for the beach walking trail. There is a shuttle to Bali Collections once an hour. Usually we walked there and took the shuttle back.", "Nusa Dua is a safe area and peaceful. We toured two days while we were there. We met a driver walking to Bali Collections and he was great. He was 400,000 RPH for the day trip to Ubud and an extra $100,000 to the volcano. The hotel arranged driver was 700,000 to Ubud. Still the hotel arranged driver is very reasonable by international standards and a safer choice, but we like the adventure of finding our own way at times. ", "We would stay there again for 3-4 days of beach time. Then head up to Ubud for a month stay away from the hussle bustle and do a little business with the carvers.\n", "\nFor a 6 night stay, it was very mediocre. I agree with Sndra 88, it needed updating, but there were some parts of the resort that were under construction, so hopefully it will help. The construction was annoying, because it was noisy and one had to take detours around the work, but that's understandable. Service was very good, but I think that is more due to the culture and not the specific resort. We experienced excellent service throughout Indonesia.", "Spa was nice, I'd give it a three star rating. Clean and tidy, but nothing over the top spectacular. I was told by a local that if you want spa treatments, it is better to go off site. One of the nice things about the spa is that they allowed kids as young as 12 to get treatments, so my daughter appreciated that!\n", "\nMy Mum & I stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for 6 nights after 2 weeks in Seminyak on our trip to Bali in January 2012. We loved the traditional Balinese style of the hotel, very different to the modern resorts in the Nusa Dua area and exactly the right place to stay for a proper Bali experience. Overall it wasn't overly expensive, there are a variety of restaurants which have reasonable priced meals (wine is expensive though!) - food is excellent quality. The buffet breakfast provides a wide range too. The staff are very very friendly. The hotel is situated on one of the best beaches in Bali, seawater is beautiful warm and clean and pool areas are great. We both would definitely stay here again!\n", "\nThe gardens of this hotel and the outdoor spaces are the best part of this hotel. We were disappointed with how dated and worn the room looked when we were escorted to it. We immediately asked if we could upgrade to a nicer room, and did not mind paying the difference. No problem. However, even the \"better\" room was not great, and having stayed at about 15 different hotels all over Bali, we know you can get better value at this price point. The buffet breakfast, was just average. There are better choices for this price range and this location (in Nusa Dua). I would not bother returning to this hotel again.\n", "\nJust completed only a short 2 night stay at NDBH. With the exception of a slightly messy check in- there was little to fault. The staff at the property are by far the friendliest- most helpful group I have encountered at any hotel worldwide. The little touches throughout our stay is what will have me return time over. ", "You truly know that you are in Bali throughout your stay with the various influences each way you turn. Certainly not something you find from most hotels in Bali (for instance- try the Westin next door). The ambiance created at every area of the resort is amazing. From breakfast where traditional Balinese music is audible from somewhere nearby played as you eat- to the lounge bar area where the staff fast became friends. The overall design of the hotel is not only incredibly clever- its something special that I will remember for a lomg time to come. ", "If you\u00b4re looking for luxury AND a truly amaying stay, I couldnt possibly recommend this hotel enough!!!\n", "\nMy wife and I had 7 days here and loved it. I had researched it closely here on TA and was delighted with the choice. The hotel advertises itself as a family resort and indeed it is \u2013 there are many families, but still a mix of people of all ages and from many countries. The 2,3 and 4 story wings of the resort are built round the central pools, restaurants and performance area, with quite stunning gardens and is close to the beach. Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is also large \u2013 apparently employing over 1,000 locals.", "Service is excellent \u2013 housekeeping and food service really stood out as amongst the best I have experienced in a hotel like this. There is a good choice of restaurant type (and price) in the resort and WIFI is FREE in the large foyer area (just ask and you will be given a code). Although my kids have long since grown up, they would have loved this place \u2013 breakfast buffet to die for, pools, Kids club, wild squirrels and lizards, clean sand and the ocean! The hotel was at about 70% capacity in the last week of January \u2013 still pretty busy for Chinese New Year.", "The Kecak cultural dance at the hotel on Sunday night was absolutely fantastic \u2013 highly recommended. For some more culture I also recommend the nearby Museum Pacifika \u2013 full of artists impressions of Bali, absolutely beautiful but probably not for the kids. It\u2019s in the street behind Bali Collection shopping mall.", "One concern. I think one of the issues with big resorts like this is that you cannot easily see beyond the front gate. Part of the problem is, unless you\u2019ve been there before, you simply don\u2019t know where you are, and neither of the Nusa Dua resorts I\u2019ve stayed at offer a good local map. For example, Bali Collection, the outdoor shopping mall serviced by a shuttle bus from the hotel, is easy WALKING distance from the big resorts like the Westin and Nusa Dua Beach Hotel. You don\u2019t need to get the bus! But why go to Bali Collection for food anyway- it is wildly inconsistent in quality and although often cheaper than the hotel, the service can also be quite indifferent and ambience it does not have. So if you want another Bali food experience than your hotel, walk 5 minutes along the beach path from Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, past Club Med, to Kendi Kunning restaurant and enjoy the genuine alternative, or walk past the security gate to go to a local Nusa Dua restaurant. The local area and beach also offers Kuta style (and price) massages \u2013 not my cup of tea but some people love them. The hotel massages are clearly in a superior category.", "My only surprise at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was on checking out. Having booked a whole extra day because we had a late night flight, we were told on arrival we would only need to pay for half a day as it was just a late check out. A nice surprise! But on checking out, we did have to pay the whole day and were told it wasn\u2019t possible to have a late check out! There are lots of late night flights out of Bali, so I hope the hotel can develop a consistent policy on this. And if it\u2019s not possible to have a late checkout, then full room cleaning should be done \u2013 which we didn\u2019t get before we left at 7 pm on the last day. Anyway, it didnt spoil the experience for us, but its something for the hotel to fix.\n", "\nWe stayed at the NDBH after 6 nights in Legian. We booked a palace club room for ourselves and deluxe rooms for our sons. Rooms are lovely only having been recently renovated. Our palace room was huge, with a large bathroom with bathtub and separate rain shower, deluxe room was shower only. The hotel was 100% full while we were there so service was slow at times but no major problem. We had breakfast in both the club lounge and the restaurant and unfortunately was the same every day so it did get a bit boring after a few days. Afternoon tea in the club lounge was exceptional and the club lounge is in the most beautiful setting. Evening drinks in the lounge were good but be warned most guests did dress up more than is the norm in Bali.", "The pools are lovely but we did have problems getting lounges. I went for a walk one morning at 6.30am and almost all the lounges around the pool were already taken but remained empty till early afternoon. Grass around the pool and down to the beach was incredible, it was so soft - like walking on carpet. The beach is nice and clean and the water was clear.", "I'm not sure if i would go back to NDBH, the hotel itself and the staff were all wonderful, unfortunately they book in large groups of Russian who are extremely rude and let their kids run riot around the pools and restaurants. Staff also seemed to cater to the Russian's every whim (probably because they screamed at the poor Balinese) sometimes forgetting that there were other guests at the hotel.\n", "\nWe stayed at Nusa dua beach hotel in October 2011 and can't rave enough about it. We travelled with 4 families and check-in was friendly and quick, with a free cocktail. 3 out of 4 rooms were beautiful, overlooking the pool and garden, whilst the other room was further from ours and was overlooking a garden (which was still nice, but not as nice as ours). However when we asked if we could be together they were very helpful in changing the room to one next to ours the next day - which was great. The staff were very friendly and the girls at breakfast were great with the children. The food was great and very reasonable, yes a bit more than outside but still a great price. If your a drinker make sure you collect your duty free as spirits at the hotel were expensive. Apart from that a beautiful hotel and we cant wait to return.\n", "\nMy mum, sister and I spoilt ourselves to a break in the first week of December and chose to go to Bali as our escape. I researched the various hotels on trip advisor and selected Nusa Dua Beach Hotel as the best place for our getaway. On the site it seemed perfectly located as it was not too far away from the main shopping town of Kuta but enough of a distant so that we were away from the hustle and bustle of it all. The rooms looked superb, clean, modern and yet still with the feel of being in an exotic place. The hotel seemed to have kept the Balinese feel with a modern touch with all the facilities advertised and the price was affordable for a 4 star hotel. ", "I did not go wrong by choosing this hotel! It was everything and more!! We were thrilled when we got there as the hotel was all ready to welcome us. It was exactly like the pictures had shown! stunning hotel, modern yet a balinese feel to it, helpful staff. A shuttle every hour to the Bali Collection Mall. Taxi's readily available for tours and transport around Bali. Ask for a driver called John. His real name is Wayan but as you will see there are a few so ask for John. If you do see him send him my regards, he was awesome driver!!", "The Beach is breathtaking and the area is safe at any time of the night. Night walks on the path are encouraged as there are always security patroling. There is a market down the road from the hotel where you can buy all your souveniors and do your shopping. The water sports centre is a few km down path to hotel. The whole Nusa Dua area is superb! ", "The food at the hotel was awesome and very affordable! Breakfast was a full spread every day of a variety of local and international cuisine. There is a choice of restaurants to choose from for lunch and dinner and the loungebar is awesome for sipping cocktails and unwinding after a long day of sighseeing or shopping. The staff are very friendly especially \"sofar\" who is a young lady who ensured our needs were always met. ", "If you are looking for a tasteful, upmarket, value for money hotel you cant go wrong with this one! We will definitely be back!\n", "\nI stayed two nights around Christmas day, and enjoyed it very much. Especially with the room that is located so close to breakfast, pool, and beach. My kids love the beach so much, they practically spending most of the time getting wet in the beach and pool. They only got indoor for food and sleep. Sometimes, they did get tired and wanted a break. There are many water sport activities based on Benoa, so you have to go to Benoa first before you do anything else. And for me this is a put off, less practical, wasting time, spend more for transport, and get off from, no offense to the locals, two stars places. ", "What I love about this particular Nusa Dua spots (around these four hotels), you can take the glass bottom boat trip (250rb/boat/hour) off the hotel's beach provided is not during low tide. They will take you not too far into the sea where you can spots lots of fishes. Or you can snorkel and dive. Remember to ask for direct, not via Benoa. Returning to the hotel, I was told it was low tide and the boat couldn't make it to the beach. So we will have to get off at beach next to Club Med. Luckily I stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, it was only 3 minutes walk, ClubMed is located next to Nusa2Beach. Apparently Nusa Dua Beach is higher than the other three hotels to the South.

Our room and all the amenities were very clean and modern, breakfast buffet was adequate and evening dining options also not bad.", " ", "Still, would like to note a couple of things", "- the noise proof of the rooms is poor, especially from the balcony and the corridor. So typically you couldnt fall asleep until midnight as there was music outside and then there would be someone kicking their doors nearby at 6-7 am. anyway we still managed to get our sleep later in the day, but some others would possibly go for a separate villa or at least an upgrade to the room (palace club or whatever its called)", "- coctails and fresh juices (and in-house dining generally as well) were very nice but somewhat pricey (around 12$ for a pina colada)", "Note however that overall we had a very pleasant stay. I mean Four Seasons etc would be possibly be even better and the rooms quieter, but the price would be double/triple as well and overall this hotel really keeps at par with the best 5 star hotels while the effort from the hotel team is really worth the stay.\n", "\nCan't say enough about this place. Beautiful location, great service, amazing views. I went for several early morning (sunrise) walks in both directions along the beach and the views were just breathtaking. When we arrived there was a bit of a mix-up regarding our reservation (two adjoining rooms) - Suasana stepped in and did a fantastic job of resolving the situation; we couldn't have been happier with what he did for us.

Especially in cul de sac areas\n", "\nWe had a 10 day stay here and I cannot praise the staff enough for their attention to detail, and the enormous efforts they go to , to make the guests happy and enjoy their stay. The location and grounds are beautiful, nice place to chill and relax and very cheap taxis ( blue Nusa Dua taxi) if you want to venture further afield for a while. On this trip to Bali we decided that we wanted to be away from the hustle and bustle and the hotel is the perfect location for that.", "Palace lounge club staff were exceptional, however I have to agree with the other reviewer, on a couple of occasions service of drinks was pretty slow, you had to wonder why. The snacks could be improved upon also. The cocktails and other drinks are delicious however and we also enjoyed the breakfasts in that area.", "The practice of guests 'reserving' poolside loungers for the day by popping down in the morning and leaving numerous towels needs to be addressed, as does the noise that others made at all hours of the night, but I understand that can be difficult for staff.", " They have a lot of people from all walks of life and all nationalities to deal with. We were below such noisy people for a couple of nights, but when brought to the attention of staff, we were upgraded and able to move to a very quiet room for the rest of our stay.", "We met guests there who had stayed on 7 or 8 occasions, they love it.", "The hotel was decorated beautifully for the festive season, the hotel went out of its way, serving Christmas cookies and chocolates in the room, champagne with breakfast on New Years Day and presenting us with a beautiful hotel calender when we left.

I was sick for the first few days when we arrived, so was unable to get out into the amazing grounds, pool, indulge in the spa, eat all the food that they offered until the very last 2 days! Gutted! But the little I did try, I liked very much. Customer service here is mint. They all looked great, and had good basic English. Breakfast is excellent, room service is quick, the pools are good (when they're not over run with children, but you can escape to the spa pool of you feel there is too much going on in the main pools). The hotel just looks and feels luxurious and you can spoil yourself rotten or lie back with a book.", "Now, there are a couple of things that should be addressed but they did not take our enjoyment of the place away. These are: 1) laundry service is astronomical! They will charge per item and the cost can range from $2 for a pair of knickers to $15 for a shirt. What will cost you $5 at the laundrymat in Melbourne will cost you $70 easily here. 2) if you are staying in a deluxe room with garden view, the terrace seems a little exposed and if it rains (which it does a lot in Bali during this season) there is no protection for you to sit out and watch a good rain (which we love to do). You will get soaked. At this level of hotel you should get more privacy and protection from the elements. 3) the mini bar is expensive (which they always are but there is no space to store your own water which is a shame). 4) the spa is lovely but try and ask for an experienced masseur as my second massage definitely did not hit the spot as you'd expect.", "I would definitely stay again, though I would upgrade to the Palace club suites. Nusa Dua itself is not very busy, which is sometimes exactly what you want!\n", "\nWe had booked for 4 nights at NDBH coming from Legian. Our check in was smooth and foyer lovely but as soon as we started walking toward our room down the corridor I started to worry, feeling hemmed in. We had a deluxe room for 4 and it looked ok when we went in, a bit dark but nice furniture and perfect for our needs. When we went out on the verandah we overlooked a fire hydrant and the exhaust fans from the adjacent hotet which wasn't very pleasant. The kids bathroom really smelt bad and when I went to have a shower the dodgy renovations caused the shower to overflow like a waterfall!", "The pool and beach areas are nice, there were some major yobbos around the pool, jumping off the pool bar so that spoilt the serenity.", "We walked to Bali Collections for dinner and had a nice meal, we couldn't believe the prices of massages here!", "We woke the next morning and made the decision that none of us were happy here and we rang Kumala Pantai to see if our room was still available. It wasn't but the President suite above ours was. We checked out and headed back to KP where we had a huge suite overlooking the pool with great restaurants/massages/shopping at our fingertips, for the same price as NDBH!", "I'm not saying it was an awful hotel, it was nice, but the area, meals served, prices and swankyness/removed from Bali was not our cup of tea.\n", "\nWe stayed here for 4 night on Mar 2011.", "Pros: 3 pools , few restaurants , private beach, gym,Friendly squirrels", "Cons: Expensive to eat inside the hotel, but you will have no choice as there is no restaurants nearby , Have to take a taxi to go out or walk 20 -30 min.", "Bit crowed but have to understand have 100's of room guest. Have to pay for using tennis and squash court. And have to pay for WiFi .

Great food and prices at all the resturants, great food also at other hotels and Bali Collection nearby, all easy walking distance. Only 30 mins dirve from Kuta. Free upgrade to a Palace Club Suite was awesome, but the Palace Club Lounge a tad dissapointing, ordering free cockatils during the 2-hour window is excruciatingly slow, almost as if on purpose, then they \"run out\" of Jack Daniels!? Shelves stocked up again when free time is up though! Breakfast food hygiene, hmmm, some things need to be kept on ice, or not re-used the next day. Stay away from the cheese!

(Neither of these companies are associated with Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, I should point out).", "So, we were really hoping for the luxury and quiet space we should have had all week - and we were rewarded very well! On arrival, the staff were very welcoming and completely prepared for our arrival. I was a little disappointed in the distance we had to walk from reception to our room, but it was OK once we'd done it a few times and the view and location were worth it - we were right at the pools and restaurants, so that was great. I was very glad I upgraded to a Premier Room for not much greater cost, as it was probably quite a bit bigger and with better outlook than the regular rooms. Air con was a relief (the poor air con at our previous accommodation had to work very hard to just offer a slight chill to the air), bed and pillows were great. We would have appreciated more complimentary bottled water each day, as it is necessary to consume a great deal to rehydrate.", "We enjoyed a meal at the pizza restaurant for lunch - yum - and with great service, too. Main pool was excellent but I didn't like the \"beach\" pool as the sand was very stony and hurt my feet. It also looks a bit tired and needs renovating. Lovely purple pool towels and comfy lounges for reading and relaxing, with umbrellas to shade my pale skin :-). Following day we enjoyed the \"Nusa Dua Explosion\" from the pool bar. It was served in a pineapple - loads of fun. ", "The highlight of our food experience (due to our short stay, we didn't try all the restaurants) was breakfast! Gosh, there was everything one could ask for. I can't imagine anyone could possibly complain about anything. This is NOT a complaint, but as there was a big container of lovely iced chocolate, I would have loved the same of iced coffee - that would have been delicious. It was a bit embarrassing watching some people carry a few pieces of whole fruit out of the restaurant to have later - does this happen all the time? I wouldn't have dreamt of doing that.", "As our flight home was not until 1.00am, we were able to leave our bags with the concierge and make use of the hotel pool and other facilities until we needed to leave. It was great and when we had been out for part of the evening, returning hot and tired, we grabbed our small bag from the concierge and made use of the Santi Lounge, the wonderful \"departure lounge\" downstairs from reception. We had a refreshing shower with fresh towels and all amenities we needed, then relaxed in comfort on sofas in the air-conditioned large room watching tv and had a coffee before returning to reception to order our taxi for the airport.", "It was with sadness we said goodbye to this wonderful hotel - smiling and helpful staff, everything spotlessly clean, true Balinese decoration (oh my, the carving on handrails and the lights in the main foyer were truly amazing!!) and wonderful Balinese hospitality.

The staff from management to porters are very welcoming and can't be faulted. The actual complex is very big & beautifully designed with lovely Balinese style small buildings dotted around everywhere. We stayed for 8 days & tried all the restaurants on site & all were good but my favourite has to be the pizzeria which is in the middle of the complex right next to the swimming pools. At night it is a wonderful setting as is the beach restaurant. I've seen many people on Tripadvisor moaning about the prices of the eateries but hey, your staying in a 5 Star complex so it's not that bad. Going on to prices - everything is a tad on the upper side I.e laundry, spa etc but I guess if you want the serene setting then you'll have to pay for it.

However, I experience smelly toilet, I change rooms, and have same problem. The food in restaurant and room service are delicious, but the price very expensive (especially in restaurant) and be ready to wait, its need 25 mnts for room service. No free internet inside room.

Our every request was listened too and any issue resolved immediately. ", "The room was recently refurbished and very clean, comfortable and stylish, looking out over the gardens. The nights were very quiet, however, we could hear the people above us walking around their room in the middle of the night, as well as a wedding party singing around the pool late until 1am, which was near our room. Maybe ask for a room away from the pool and restaurants if you really want absolute quiet.", "We enjoyed a couple's romance package at the Spa, which was fabulous. The therapists were excellent, but the spa/steamroom/sauna area could do with a renovation. The plunge pool area was lovely though.", "The restaurants were excellent. The food delicious and the prices very reasonable. We had the BBQ at the Asian restaurant one night, lunch at the chess bar another day, and breakfast each morning. The breakfast choices were good, however, if you want extras such as cappucino/latte or poached eggs - be prepared to wait and/or follow up you order as it may not come at all. This seems to be an issue with communication (or understanding of english) with the restaurant staff.", "We loved the pool area - swim up bar, views of beach.

I thought the breakfast was really good considering it is included, agree that the other restaurant meals are expensive (especially since i have now traveled to other parts of the island) and it is not that motivating to go off site since everything close by is likely as expensive. The gym was well stocked and cold given the outside temperature. The lap pool stunning. Everything was clean, as i single traveler i was bored. Pool water was hot..ocean not really swimmable.

Unlike the bad experience I had on Kuta beach. The rooms are clean as you might expect from a hotel this calibre. The staffs were also very attentive. The cleaners check on us twice a day to ensure we do not need anything. The food are quite good, though a little more variety and asian food will be appreciated. The facilities, kids club, and everything was just picture perfect. Our 4 years old daughter were having such a blast in the pool, beach, and the cute squirrels roaming about the garden.", "We asked for a babycrib from the hotel since we were also bringing our 9 months old son.

We were bringing a baby, so you can imagine how much stuff we had in the room. Meanwhile our son got bored locked up in a crib and decided to protest by grabbing the crib door railings and start shaking it. We didn't think much about it, since he always did this with any crib he's in. But this time, it seems that the crib does not have safety standard. I was coming out of the bathroom carrying stuff in it when i saw the door of the crib flies open downward by itself, and along with my son still grabbing the railings. He fell down headfirst to the ground from the 50-70cm tall crib. A bit of lucky stroke that my bedcover were lying down on the floor right in front of the crib to somewhat cushion his fall. We checked him and glad to know that he's alright with a small bump on his head. At least no major concussion or broken bones. It seems that the lock on the crib is loose and were opened by itself due to the shaking and jiggling.", "We were planning to complain to the staff, but since we were in a hurry due to very tight schedule with our return planes, we were practically running to catch the plane in the airport and totally forgot about it.", "Don't get me wrong. This hotel is really really a nice place to stay. And I'm sure if I had the chance to properly complain to the staff, they would have been able to accomodate it very properly.

", "The beach area is kept clean and tidy and due to the reef head being someway out the bay does not suffer from wave wash so is ideal for swimming when the tide is in, however the bay seems devoid of sea life and so snorkelling Is a disappointment. The only way to see some fish life is to hire one of the many boats from one of the beach vendors stalking the beach, and this is where things take a turn for the worse. There is no set price for these trips and you need to haggle with the vendor before agreeing to anything, further to this, on the trip we had arranged we first had to negotiate the tens of jet skies, powerboats and parascenders that have taken up the bay area north of Nusa Dua then taken to a so called turtle breeding facility that amounted to nothing more than exploitation of the turtle and many other animals for pictures that are kept chained or have their flight feathers clipped to prevent escape, kept in filthy surroundings and prodded for entertaiment of the visitors there.we were then asked for a cash donation before we could leave the island !

Our wedding anniversary was celebrated at Raja\u2019s Balinese Cuisine. Raja\u2019s signature dish is the whole duck which is an absolute delight; we also had three meals at Sandro\u2019s Pizzeria (the pizza\u2019s would have to be the best in Bali); Chess Beachfront Restaurant & Bar is fabulous to have dinner on the deck looking out over the beach and lunches are HUGE \u2013 one meal easily satisfies two people!; and the room service menu is extensive \u2013 the club sandwich is terrific value. We also enjoyed snacks by the pool and daily drinks at the swim up pool bar. I have been reading other reviews on Trip Advisor since March of this year and a number of people have complained about the pricing of food and drinks at the hotel and commented that one can eat cheaper outside the hotel. This is true \u2013 we dined at Tropical outside the main estate gates, and also had two dinners at Bali Collection. Yes the meals were cheaper than those at the hotel, but the quality of the food was in no way comparable to hotel meals and the service was non-existent. If you are looking for food only, then by all means dine outside, but if you appreciate quality of food and service, then what the hotel is offering is extremely good value for money. Our dinner at Raja\u2019s for example (3 courses) cost us AUD$140 when the same meal would have cost considerably more back in Aus. ", "SUGGESTION: a menu board should be displayed for Raja\u2019s. The absence of a menu board may deter people from dining due to a perception that it is exclusive and expensive.", "The Nusa Dua Spa is delightful. Again, you may be able to get cheaper massages on the beach or outside the hotel, but the experience would not be on a par. The scented celebration is highly recommended.", "During our stay, one of our travelling companions suffered a serious injury and required major surgery before he could be airlifted back home. The assistance provided to us by the hotel was, and still is, incredibly humbling. The Resident Manager (Mr Peter Scholz) made himself available to us at all hours of the day and night, and the Palace Club Team were so amazing in their care and concern for our friend, and also for my husband and my welfare. The hotel assisted with Visa issues, visited our friend in hospital in Denpasar (bearing gifts of an incredible fruit basket and flowers), and were generally an absolute pillar of support to us. We could not have dealt with our crisis as well as we did had it not been for Peter and the Palace Club Team.

The entrance area is open and welcoming leading to well attended gardens housing a few different style pool areas, restaurants, with quiet areas to repose in leading to the beach itself. There is a jogging track which runs the length of the property and also the other 5 star resorts that border the beach.

Can not say one bad word of this hotel, its simply a dream. Rooms are spacious, clean, two times a day they come and check if you need anything. Bathroom is modern and has evrything one need. Nice terrace where you have a lovely view of the gardens. The palace club gives alot of advantages such as great breakfast, partiatly a la carte and buffet, tea time and cocktail time. You get personal butler and those people do whatever they can to make it comfortable for you. There are several restaurants in the hotel, good ones, 3 swimmingpools, a great clean beach. In fact words can not describe fully what you get there...not cheap but really value for your money. I will be back thats for sure and i wont forget how the staff helped me when i had problems there.\n", "\nI had the pleasure to stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for some days in September. It\u2019s a relaxing and quiet place, great rooms and I was lucky to have a private swimming pool, heated and great for a night swim.

The hotel was beautiful and definitely did not disappoint. The pools are beautiful and the view gorgeous. We arrived to a complimentary drink and rose petals strewn on our bed. It was such a relief after the hectic drive from the airport in Denpasar. While I personally hated the \"rainfall\" shower head, the rest of the room was beautiful. The balcony looked out onto well manicured lawns and gardens...I could sit there forever. The breakfast included with our room was absolutely spectacular. This was probably the best hotel breakfast I have ever had. And the coffee, bread/danish and fruit selection was amazing. The hotel is situated fairly close to Bali Collection so that if you need any souvenirs or just want to grab some dinner, it's convenient. The hotel staff was very pleasant and always very eager to please.

Beautiful hotel- gorgeous gardens and buildings. We loved the hotel though knew it was going to be more expensive than anywhere else in Bali, we were on our \"babymoon\" so didnt really mind. It was peaceful and relaxing- just what we wanted. Dont stay here if you are looking for bargains, or to do lots of shopping/tours- since its far away from most places, taxis/travel can get expensive if you dont know how to bargain well. Come here if you want to spend your time getting spa treatments, swim in the pool and be pampered. The staff were all lovely, approachable and respectful. The included breakfast was awesome, and catered for me being vegetarian and pregnant. Lots of restaurants on-site and the poolside service was excellent. The room was fantastic with gorgeous views and all your needs catered for. We did find the bed very hard but it wasnt a big deal. Since I was only drinking bottled water, the free bottled water in the room was appreciated.

Our friends who stayed next door at the Westin agreed that the Nusa Dua hotel has far more atmosphere and the most beautiful grounds. Also the spa is lovely and we appreciated not having to share the spa pool with children. Appreciated the ladies only sauna and jacuzzi too. Our room was lovely and we were given a complimentary upgrade which was a nice touch. The room looked out over stunning gardens - a wonderful way to wake up. The food in the restaurants we tried (4 out of 5 tried) was all very good and not badly priced for people coming from Australia. Had some lovely cocktails in the lobby bar too.

The instructor I had hired got far too 'friendly' while sitting behind me on the jet ski. I was covered up in a one piece and cotton top, and old enough to be his mother, so I am not sure why he behaved so inappropriately but it was very out of line. Rather than elbow him in the face a half mile offshore I chose to stop, make him switch places with me, and take me back in. So I paid for 30 min and was back in after 15, and enjoyed none of it.

A pizza at the restaurant by the pool cost about AUD $12 and kids meals, including room service were about AUD $5. A room service Nasi Goreng was about AUD $8, and a beer in the hotel bar was about AUD $5. I agree that these prices are more expensive than you find outside the hotel, they are very cheap comapred to some other hotels we have stayed at in Nusa Dua.", "Our 5 year old loved the kids club, most of the time there were only 3-4 kids in there and the activities were quite varied.

The lobby bar had recently been renovated and i have to say it must be one of thee best locations to have a cocktail. The hotel had employed a professional from the UK to train the bar staff on cocktail making (the espresso martinis were amazing!) The drinks were a little expensive but what some people fail to realise is that this is a five star resort and it is expensive to drink in a lot of places in Bali as they have to import (a bottle of Jacobs creek in a local supermarket set me back $70)", "Our whole experience of Bali was amazing. We had planned on doing a lot of trips while we were there but after waking up in this hotel we only managed about two trips! The hotel is stunning and the gardens add to this. I took a walk along the beach and there are other hotels all the way along and i wouldn't say that any other hotels in nusa dua are better than the beach and spa resort. We will definately be returning here but the flight times from Scotland are something to consider (we stopped off in KL for four days on the way out).", "To all the staff at the hotel, thank you for an amazing honeymoon.\n", "\nWe stayed at this hotel in nov 10, we had interconnecting rooms.

Didnt think it was worth the money. nice pools etc, staff great.\n", "\nHave just returned from spending 10 days at this hotel and what a hotel it was - WOW. This was our first trip to Bali and we didn't know what to expect. Well let me tell you, it was out of this world and yes, I have travelled to many places throughout the world so feel justified in my comments.", "The staff are excellent, always remembering our names. No matter what you asked them for, nothing was too much bother. Everyone had a smile on their faces and never passed you without a lovely smile and a friendly greeting. The hotel was spotlessly clean, from the pool area to the fish ponds. The food was out of this world. Anyone who went to breakfast and couldn't find something to eat must have something wrong with them. There was something for everyone from local, asian, continental, american and british. I must compliment the egg cook, his omlettes were delicious. We had a newly renovated room on the third floor and it was lovely. We had a view of the pool, ocean and gardens, so felt we had it all. It was our friend's 40th wedding anniversary while we were there and when I arranged a meal on the beach to celebrate, the customer relations staff arranged for their room to be decorated with flowers, fruit and a card at no cost. The staff at the Chess restaurant couldn't have made more of a fuss of them, nothing was too much bother. As for the location, yes it is a wee bit away from Bali Collection, but hey a 10 minute walk along the beach front, shuttle bus from the hotel or a cheap taxi - you are never far away.

It's beautiful, luxurious and the staff is very welcoming. But u're in a tourist enclave and have no contact with the local culture beyond the hotel staff.

A good idea if u want to ease into the indonesian experience but know that u're an expensive cab ride from most activities.\n", "\nI stayed here after getting married at St.Regis Hotel. The later is more like a 7 star Hotel, so when I got to Nusa Dua Beach Resort I was almost upset. But that did not last long, as this Hotel is 5 star, and has everything you need for a beautiful stay. Buffet breakfast is fantastic, the location ideal. We loved all the restaurants, and the beautiful walk along the beach at night time (when you walk past all the other Hotels). This is the 1st Hotel in Nusa Dua, and they are giving it a facelift now to keep it upto date and fresh. Great memories.\n", "\nBut perhaps not in Bali? The standard of hotels on the island is really phenomenal - from the most basic accomodation to 6 star hotels. Which I think would put this hotel near the top, but perhaps second tier. I visited a few other hotels including the Bale, the Westin and Club Med and I think that would be fair. Some notes below:", "The staff - absolutely brilliant. From the gardeners to the managers, all unfailingly polite, friendly and helpful and for the most part, efficient.", "The room - we stayed in a palace club suite, which was the only way to accomodate our family of three small children and two adults (the family room was booked out). It was perfect for us. Plenty of room, two bathrooms, two cots and rollaway bed in the living room which could be closed off from the main bedroom. A nice balcony opening to the gardens which was perfect for the children to run and play while we watched. Perfectly kept and clearly recently updated.", "The Palace Club - brilliant. Personalised and fast check in, lovely peaceful club area for having breakfast where the staff called all of us by name (including the children), even holding the baby while we ate! The afternoon tea was brilliant, the cocktail hour was outstanding (comp drinks and big hors d'oevres for two hours?!), free juices and soft drinks all day, free internet access. Outstanding value, highly recommended.", "The grounds - beautifully maintained. Very Balinese. Ever so slightly tired around the pool areas - pools not quite as flash as the ones at the Westin or some of the others, the pool loungers older, towels not as smart - but frankly, the prices reflect that. The hotel was far cheaper than the Westin and many of the others, and i think actually presents very good value for money. ", "Food and drinks - Yes, the meals and drinks are very expensive. But so are all hotels, so wasn't any surprise to us. Comparing meals poolside in a 4/5 star hotel to meals in a dodgy shopping centre where there are pictures on the menu (Bali Collection) is pretty silly in my opinion. The breakfast in the Palace Club was very nice, the meals by the pool for lunch were actually very good. Enormous - we actually ended up either sharing one between two or ordered the kids meals which were about a normal sized adult meal in our world! The pizzas were excellent - far better than anticipated in an asian country. Didn't try anything else - we preferred driving into Seminyak. Which brings me to...", "Location - this was prob the downside for us. We were keen to eat out at lots of the great restauarants but the vast majority that we wanted to go to were in the Seminyak area, which was a long round trip drive (45 mins each way usually) each night. However, if you wanted to hang around primarly in your hotel (and eat there or in other hotels in the area) it would suit you down to the ground.", "Children - we bought in our own nanny from outside which the hotel was perfectly happy with. We tried the kids club twice and were disappointed. Very few kids (four on both occasions), the room was a bit dark and depressing (although very well stocked with toys etc), seemed to be no sign of the advertised activities going on, and on both occasions when I went to pick up the kids they were sitting watching TV. There shouldn't even be a TV in my opinion, and they certainly shouldn't be watching it when you have three staff members, two rooms full of toys, a playgound and a swimming pool at your disposal! Perhaps they should think about a booking-in system so at least they would know what activities they might do with those aged kids etc? Should be better kids meals available - I don;t think it is acceptable anymore to have a menu that is almost exclusively what i would call junk food (hotdogs, chicken nuggets). There was a pasta on the menu and one steamed chicken dish which were good, but we had to beg them not to add chips to every dish! Smaller, healthier meals would have been appreciated.", "The clientele - started off well, good mix of couples, families, young people. Its a big place so even those with kids don't seem to get in the way of others. Unfortunately there was a group of very loud and rough sorts that moved in half way through our stay - the type that start drinking at 9am at the pool bar, shout obscenities across the pool at each other etc. Luckily you could avoid them mostly, but its not what I expected from this type of hotel (and probably not something they can always avoid I guess - although maybe not serving Bintang in the pool until lunchtime?!). I should add they have water aerobics in the pool every morning - I am sure some people love it, but it is a pet hate of mine at hotels to have ridiculously loud music pumping through the pool area at 10am and shouting instructor, but maybe that is just me!", "Overall, despite the niggles mentioned, we were delighted with the hotel. The staff were exceptional, the room lovely and we felt it was very good value for money.\n", "\nI stayed in this hotel on many occasions before, and being the first hotel in the peninsula, i reckon the rooms looked tired naturally. Figure it's time to give it a try beside my favorite melia. Also need the varieties so kids are not bored. This year alone i've been to nusa dua for 4 times. To my surprise, i was given the newly renovated room, and boy it look nice!!! I'll just skip the standards and go to the points where the hotel stands out.", "1. New Room.

Has kids menu so i I don't have to order adult portion for my kids. Pocket friendly. ", "3. Pool. Heated and has sandy area so kids don't get sunburn staying in the beach too long. Instead playing sand under the shade in the pool. Most hotels don't have this. The pool is really warm, lucky my little 5 years old mad scientist brought thermometer, so we got some readings on Sept. 5th, 7pm, the sea temp 27.4 deg celsius, air 26.2, and pool 30.7. For comparison, 2 days later in melia's pool was 29.5. So it is indeed much warmer. Yes 1 degree makes quite a difference.", "4. Kids friendly. Kids club has many toys and its free. Kids table with crayons and coloring papers to occupy them during breakfast.", "5. Senior staffs working around the pool gives the dino hotel an old charm. It feels like the hotel has a heart and loyalty. Personally, i treasure the warm greetings from Pak Anom and Pak Raka. They add certain characters to the hotel.", "6. Unusual service. You name what you don't do in other hotels, they are more tolerant than you might think. Have seen kids eat in the kids club. Endless popcorns for the kids in kids' club Pool mats moved to the garden for people having lunch picnic style. Salted Butter delivered to the beach for unique guest.", "7. Squirrel. Yes there are so many of them than other hotels, and they are so much braver. This could be bad as well. Got so close to me and snatched the cookie off my cappuccino around the pool. ", "Down sides: not enough lighting. It has sleepy and tired atmosphere, not romantic and jolly. Need lots of candles to make it romantic. And flowers here and there as well. Arts. Maybe outdoor speakers. Not enough choices for breakfast. And please watch out for the scalding hot plates. Couldn't pick up so many of them, and so got it from the other stack. Last one is the middle area between rear stairs and pool is dark, unused, and seem like a waste. Given that size, It could turn into something practical and lively.", "One suggestion for the hotel management, please give free room upgrade like in Melia and Marriot, customers enjoy it and will come for more.

We discovered the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa in 2009. This is the best hotel I have stayed at in the world. You will never be spoilt by the staff anywhere like you will here. Sometimes it takes a bit getting the message across about what you want, but then they will deliver. We have no experience of the Palace club, but if it is better than the regular hotel, wow. I read another review that commented that this hotel had no character. Unbelievable. The architecture of this hotel and the gardens, the dress of the staff all scream BALI. Some of the newly renovated rooms are becoming more westernised but still very nice. Check the guest photos, they don't lie. You can always go to the Oasis Beach REsort up the road for something new.

Having all this you will never be hungry.", " This hotel is now completing big renovations which are hardly creating any inconvenience to guests as the hotel has 3 wings and they are spread far apart.

Walking it would only take 10-15 minutes.", "Now the areas where we were disappointed:", " - As honeymooners I expected at least a tiny bit of fuss to be made of us - something to make us feel a little special. Instead all they offered was 2 towels twisted into the shape of swans and a letter welcoming us and inviting us to purchase a seriously overpriced meal overlooking the sea. I realise we are not the only people on honeymoon, but come on...you can do better than that!", "- The price of food and drink in the hotel needs a serious review - it is laughably expensive. It is at least 3 times as expensive of that in the local shopping district. For the sake of a 10 minute walk or 3 minute taxi ride I don't understand why anyone would eat at the hotel?!", "- Water. This was a joke. It's a '5 star hotel' situated in a hot climate. It should be free, but instead there is a 600% mark up over the local shops. Price of a small bottle of locally branded water in the hotel cost 22,000 Rup, the same bottle in the local shops was 3500 Rup. Why? Disgraceful.", "- Wi-Fi. EVERY hotel I have stayed at in the last 2 years (including lesser hotels in 'money grabbing' Russia) have offered free Wi-fi. So it beggers belief that 30 minutes of internet access will cost you 30,000 Rup! In a 5 star hotel you CAN NOT be charging for Wi-Fi.", "These things didn't spoil our experience, because everything they didn't offer the local shops and restaurants did. But then it begs the question why the hotel can't do them as well? ", "Overall, a great choice as long as you don't expect to stay on site for your meals!\n", "\nIf it was not for the Excellent service provided by the Spa team I would have changed hotels. It's old and stale, dreary decor! Breakfast was ordinary, lunch at chess bar was a little better. Hotel shop prices were 3 times the price of local shopping area.\n", "\nMy husband and I went to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel as part of our honeymoon. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. The breakfast dining area was located by a fabulous pond and plants. Unfortunately there were a few things that I found very disappointing in this hotel.", "1. The price for food and drink was exceptionally expensive. A glass of wine was around 10euro and a cocktail 15euro. This is far too much. We probably would have spent a lot more there if the prices were not so prohibitive, instead we left the hotel to eat and drink.", "2. The room had no bath.", "3. We were promised a surprise by the receptionist when we checked in but nothing ever arrived.\n", "\nAnother fantastic trip the renovations look great, the spa centre is beautiful, as was the newly tiled pool. Stayed in Palace Club again service always friendly and welcoming. Rooms renovated with new furniture, large baclonies, DVD player, fridge, kitchen. Walk to Bali Collections (mall) and village markets and restuarants. Free red bus to Mall and local area. Plenty activities for kids and adults, kids club with movie night to give the parents a night off. Selection of meals is varied depending what you want try Raja's for a nice night out at quality restaurant with Indonesian food.\n", "\nFrom the moment you walk through the Balinese gates into the complex your stress melts away. Simply stunning open air feel lobby with authentic Bali statues and gardens. Stayed in a slightly older pair of inter-connected rooms. Parts of the hotels are being upgraded but at a very gentle pace so as to keep disruption to a minimum. Our room was large, comfortable and air conditioned. It had quite dated TV and general fittings compared to the newer rooms on the 1000's side, we were on the 4000's side. Our rooms though were large and very comfortable. Nice view of the rear gardens. Only downside was the walk to the main lobby and pool areas was around 10 mins.\n", "\nfantastic hotel , with long beaches , excellent rooms .", "the club wing is not facing the sea which is a negative but the rooms are nice.", "the food is nice it is in nusa dua area therefore it is secured and clean. overall a good vacation.", "for indian meals visited gateway of india restaurant which the hotel had suggested.fantastic food,\n", "\nWe stayed in a Palace Club Suite for 10 nights and enjoyed our time at the hotel. The room was nicely furnished with a good size lounge area, seperate bedroom and large, clean well appointed bathroom.", "The hotel grounds are very nice, there are 2 pools next to each other, 1 lagoon style and 1 freeform concrete, both a good size. Plenty of sun lounges but as usual you need to get in early to get a good spot. As always plenty of people who put down towels and then dont show up till the afternoon. I have no problem in moving to these lounges if they are left empty , hotels always say they enforce a no reservation rule on sunbuds but never do, much easier to enforce the rule yourself.", "Breakfast at club level was excellent, a la carte style for cooked items with a buffet selection of pastries, cereals and fruit. We went and looked at the main buffet breakfast venue on one morning but looked fairly average and we quickly retreated back to the club lounge.", "in room dining was ok, i did get sick from 1 meal ordered in house which always puts you out of action for a day but my wife had no problems. Other resaurants on site were ok, nothing special but adequate. Price was standard for any hotel in the area, which is a little less than western pricing but expensive for Bali. Beer and coktail prices by the pool were not to bad.", "There are plenty of cheap and tasty dining options around the area if you jump in a taxi.", "Nusa Dua is a resort area and I would only stay here if you want to unwind by sitting by the pool and not doing much. If you want to get out and about and shop/party/dine I would recommend Legian or Seminyak.", "The hotel is located on a strip including the Westin and Laguna, both are very nice properties and having stayed at both are a step up from Nusa Dua beach hotel but do cost more as well.\n", "\nWe had a lovely week at this hotel. Relaxing, clean, amazing breakfast with a wide choice of food to suit various tastes, Lovely gardens and swimming pools although the lagoon pool needs updating as the surface is rough, beach area is clean and has a lovely pathway for lazy walks, staff are attentive, friendly, kind people and the service is excellent. Rooms are clean and the bed was comfortable, I had booked a deluxe room but had a standard room allocated, we requested a bathroom with a bathtub and approached staff at reception twice to no avail, the bathroom was small and the water pressure was poor but the room was good in all other aspects. ", "The only other negatives are the bar prices, very expensive for nothing special, it was quiet with no music. If the prices were lower then more quests would enjoy the bar area rather than leaving for the other resorts.", "Tip: Ask for blue bird taxis when out and about as they are metered and very reasonable. ", "On the whole we enjoyed our week here and would recommend it to friends, will hopefully return again.\n", "\nWe arrived back yesterday morning after the usual \"great\" overnight flight on Virgin, never again!! The Hotel is a haven from the touts on the beach and all the traffic that now chokes Bali in general. Just visit Kuta for a few hours and you will understand why this hotel stands out from the rest. ", "We had a ground floor ,refurbished Deluxe room in the Garden Wing and it was great to be able to sit amongst the lovely well maintained grounds and watch the squirrlels play. Quiet, relaxing, fairly private. Because it was ground floor we had room to sit around with 2 couples and have a drink at the end of the day on the balcony. However, the drain in the shower kept overflowing into the toliet area of the bathroom and after asking to have it cleared twice it had not been fixed. The very pleasant young lady the second time I asked for help, did apologise for the inconvenience and offer to change rooms. But as it was our second last night the thought of chnaging was hard work and incovenient. On checking out the male staff member who checked us out did comment that they have \"much trouble\" with the shower drains, but otherwise could'nt care less. The only blemish on what was an enjoyable stay.", "The staff are fantastic, especially the sous chef who does the eggs at the egg station every monring at breakfast. Brekfast is great and they manage crowds very well. Selection is also excellent. Asian food through to dohnuts and local fruits. Only down side was the bacon which is more than crisp, but to handle bacon under a klosh, for that many guests is a hard call. But still great to start the day with a slow coffee and watch all the fish in the pond next to the cafe.", "Chess Beachfront Restaraunt is a good spot to have a dinner on the beach. The night we dined, unfortunatley the wind was blowing a gale and we had trouble keeping our bread rolls on the table. But the young lady who was our watress was gracious and made it an adventure,although I am sure she was freezng. Steaks and seafood were terrific, cocktails generous and worth any guest trying this part of the hotel. At aud$75.00 per head expensive for Bali but we ate 3 courses and enjoyed the whole experience.", "We hired the hotel cars for the transfers to and from the airport. More expensive than local cars but the drivers are careful and know what they are doing and the cars are well maintined. Well worth the extra few dollars. Agus one of the drivers in particular stood out as safe and had a great sense of humour. A good guy!! To be greeted by courteous drivers with chilled water in hand was a nice touch to and from the hotel.", "One of the reasons I have'nt rated it 5 stars is due to the maintaince and that the rooms are not really a 5 star plush finish. However, if I was to saty in Bali again I would stay at this resort. Internet is expensive which in this day and age is a down side. But the cost of providing wifi to all guests would be very expensive. If you do spend the extra and pay a lot more you do get free wifi. So weighing up that cost that is individual choice.", "Housekeeping is great with the rooms serviced twice a day and plenty of towels and water. Clean rooms and rubbish whisked away, which when you are shopping is a bonus. An information card on the air conditioning controls would be a bonus as they are a bit hard to work out. The air conditioning does switch down to low when you open the door to the balcony but that is fair enough and explained when you are escorted to your room. But very very quiet rooms.", "Stay here if you want to enjoy the quiet side of Bali and relax in a quiet untroubled beach front resort.

", "Can I also say that what I love about Nusa Dua Beach Resort are as follows: Games and rec area which my athletically minded three boys (teenagers) loved, complete with billliards, darts, air hockey, squash centre and tennis courts. The boy who runs the rec centre activities is gorgeous...and the daily recreation activities are amazing, from fruit sculpting classes to beauty therapy classes to pool volleyball - all amazing!!! I enjoyed every minute. The Spa and the relaxing pool area is to die for (Ask for big spa area for massage which is normally reserved for couples but is much nicer). I also did the garden tour and loved hearing about all the wild life, plants etc...very special.", "Food is expensive and \"special event\" nights grossly overpriced, but on the whole, we were more than happy to eat lunch and have drinks/ccktails and felt that they were worth it.", "In summary - don't hesitate to go to Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa. Heaven on a stick (and you can get some really good clothes etc on the beach from some of the very few vendors allowed there!! - very well controlled). I am normally really fussy about accommodation (particularly cleanliness) but loved this; maybe a bit olde worlde Balinese'e in some rooms but I like this. If you don't like the room you are given the reception staff are very good at makin gyou happy:) Go for it.....and say Hello to Arini for us. We personally visited the top 10 resotrs in Nusa Dua and constantly came up with N D Beach ans being the best for various different reasons, eg, cost us $20.00 for a wine at St Regis Nusa Dua!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not as nice a resort we felt anyway.", "Go for Nusa Dua Beach, we will forever more.\n", "\nI would like to thank Peter Scholz (resident manager) and the staff for a most enjoyable stay in Nusa Dua. We travelled at the end of July with two young children and it was our son's 8th birthday whilst we were there and the staff made a big effort for him, beautiful cake, flowers and balloons. The hotel sits in beautiful grounds, the pools and beaches lovely and our room was very pleasant, clean and well stocked with water. The breakfast buffet was extremely good as were the eggs to order and the setting by the pond was gorgeous. We ate in the hotel on several occasions and the food was all delicious and well presented allbeit very expensive; the lunchtime bbq was a favourite too. Our children used the kids club on and off and enjoyed the activities particularly Indonesian day and movie night. We all also enjoyed the themed evenings/buffets in the theatre. We travelled around quite a bit and took in lots of Bali - we particularly liked Ubud where we went white water rafting and stayed in a fabulous hotel (reviewed separately). ", "If we had any small complaint of the Nusa Dua it would be no free wi-fi (expected in most 5* hotels) and charge for cycle hire. We enjoyed taking the bikes out as a family but could be quite costly if out for long or often! All in all a really great holiday and we would love to come back maybe next time for a special birthday and bring the rest of our family! Thank you everyone for a super holiday.\n", "\nExcellent service, staff were friendly and have made life long friends, My hubby and I stayed here at Christmas time when i was pregnant, hotel was clean, food was safe and delicious! we just got back with our 5 month old son, He had an absolute ball with all the attention from staff. Location was great, Relaxing away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta but a short walking distance to water sports and shopping. Transportation was fantastic. No one hassling you on the beach, well except for a cuddle of our baby! Cant wait to go back again for Christmas and take all our children, What an experience it is! highly recommend\n", "\nWe had a great stay in this hotel, it is one of the few authentic hotels in balinese style, but completely renovated. All the staff is so friendly and helpful. The food is great, not cheap, but good value. The location is perfect. The hotel has has several beautiful swimming pools and a great location beach, lots of gardens were you can relax. You can take a 10 min walk down de beautiful beach an you are in the Bali Collection Centre where you can shop and eat in lots of restaurants with live music. In the hotel is also every night life music and twice a week a beautiful dance is preformed with a great dinner buffet. They have also a beautiful spa were we had a great massage. We definitely will come back to this hotel!\n", "\nRooms great, breakfast amazing, beach stunning, staff friendly, pool clean. Food was good but wih the 21% tax ended up being expensive as were the drinks. There were some equally good places to eat at half the price on the road leading into Nusa Dua - only a short well lit walk away.", "Took a trip out with Bali Sea White water rafting, Ubud, Spa and seafood dinner and much more. Fantastic day out and well worth the $65 pp\n", "\nWe had the most amazing holiday with our two kids 3 years and 6 months. Hotel staff were sooo helpful and friendly and great with the kids.

All the restaurants are great.\n", "\nWe moved to the Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa after a terrible experience at the Aston Bali. This resort is unbelievably beautiful. After our bad experience at the Aston Bali we decided to take a Palace Club room and upon arrival we were upgraded to a Palace Club Suite. The room was magnificent and we were told that they are going to renovate them soon to make them more modern. The only complaint we had about the room was that the television was not flat screen and had bad reception. Our suite was located in the Palace Club section of the resort. We had special check-in and check-out. We had access to the Palace Club where our breakfast was served, menu style. So were were able to get eggs Benedict amongst other choices for breakfast and were made fresh and not on a buffet. In the afternoon we were given two hours of afternoon tea which included finger sandwiches, freshly baked scones with jam and whipped cream and choice of drink (non-alcoholic). It was a High Tea experience and absolutely lovely. In the early evening/late afternoon we had a two hours of cocktails and canapes. The choice of drink included: champagne, martinis, frozen daiquiris etc. The canapes varied from caviar to sushi to char-grilled kebabs and many others. The dining area of the Palace Club looked out over a lagoon with two gazebos and a flock of very popular ducks. It was such a pleasure to see them come for their feeding and the cameras would be flashing. They were very popular with the guests. We had access to free internet in the Palace Club and upon late check-out we were told that we could stay for High Tea.", "The grounds are amazingly gorgeous and well kept. The pools are stunning. The staff went above and beyond to make sure you had a great stay and very friendly and courteous. The drive-in entry to the resort is very impressive and majestic as is the lobby. The spa is complete with sauna, steam, jacuzzi, plunge pool, cafe, tennis courts and gymnasium with squash courts. It even has its own lap pool with lounge chairs.", "This was our first trip back to Bali in about 10 years and we are checking our diaries on how soon we can get back to the Nusa Dua Beach Resort & Spa.\n", "\nMy husband & I went there in April 2011 and stayed there for 4 days. From checking into the hotel to our last day there was so so perfect! The people are kind, helpful & you will want to stay there longer. Our room was upgraded & they decorated the bed with roses & swans (our honeymoon). We will definately stay in this hotel again soon!\n", "\nVery hard to fault the resort, it seems like they have thought of everything, different pools, bars and restaurants all have their own ambience and vibe. The Tuesday night buffet with traditional Balinese dance was wonderful in their outdoor theatre (although the sucking pig was poor). Plenty of kids activities and stuff for the kids. Found breakfast nice but nothing special. Friends also used the gym which they said was good. The day spa was booked out most days and very expensive. Beach was okay but a bit weedy. Overall had a great time and would recommend it if your into not leaving the hotel and having everything at your fingertips.\n", "\nMy fiance and I booked our room through the Agoda website, which was seamless and very easy to do, it took us a while to choose our hotel and we chose this one. Upon arriving at Denpasar Airport we were picked up by two friendly staff members from the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel our bags were all sorted and carried for us and upon checking in we were upgraded which was very nice.", "The room itself was very basic, the TV was quite old and lacked a lot in options, you really end up watching a lot of Discovery and Animal Planet due to the lack of options. The bed was very comfortable however a couple of the pillows were rather hard for myself and my fiance. The room was equipped with a fridge that was of a small but decent size and doubled as the minibar (which was expensive). The bathroom however was fine with a roomy bath and a decent shower to match we had no complaints about the bathroom. The aircon was okay, though in the humid temperatures you cannot expect air con to work perfectly. Hopefully the renovated rooms improve on a couple of the downfalls and they increase in-room entertainment options.", "Breakfast was very nice, I personally am not one for the local cuisine however there were quite a few international options with a lot of fruit, pastries and pancakes/waffles available, we had no complaints about the breakfast. We had breakfast included which I recommend as it can get pricey.", "The hotel in reality has two major swimming pools, both of which are very nice, very clean and very easy to access and were rarely busy during our stay in the first week of Australian school holidays, the Main Pool has a swim-up bar which unfortunately was quite expensive and in some cases prices were higher than Australia after Tax and Service Charge. Though do note regarding the Main Pool and Lagoon pool that they both close at 7pm. The hotel however also has a small 25m Lap Pool which is available until 10pm, no under 12s allowed in this area too.", "My Fiance and I ate at two of the restaurants at the resort, the Chess Restaurant and the Sandros restaurant, both of which were really nice and really friendly, both again compared to the rest of Bali quite pricey however when you stay in Nusa Dua you expect prices at resorts to be quite a lot higher than the general average, we were paying around 400,000 a meal with the main and drinks.", "All in all the resort was a very nice location, very nice grounds and very nice staff to match, you can see the resort really needs to keep up its renovations and improve their in-room entertainment but generally it is a very nice, quiet and relaxing place to stay. If were to return to Bali we would stay at this resort again and hopefully see our only complaints resolved.\n", "\nGreat place for a beach rest. Nice rooms. Good service oriented staff in most areas. Nice strolling grounds and overall a beautiful place. But for those who value a good spread for breakfast will be disappointed. Variety and quality is mediocre. Food items run out fast due to crowds during holiday season but this is no excuse for staff to be slow in replenishing the items. ", "On three separate occasions had to inform staff three different items had run out. You then end up waiting many minutes for them to bring it out from the galley. Even basic items like mushrooms for your omelette run out. The egg station chef informed us that there were no more mushrooms for the day and this was at 9.00 a.m. in the morning!! How much earlier do you have to go to get such basic items??", "There are insufficient variety of local dishes. Mostly only the basic international fare. Quality is very much so and so. Restaurant staff are inattentive.", "The buffet is fitting enough for a basic 4 star hotel but please...we paid for a 5 star hotel and expect a 5 star buffet...not a 4star buffet . We are not even sure if it even meets this 4 star grade.", "This was the greatest disappointment for us. And please....we are not fussy people. Only expecting to get what we paid for.

(well it may as well be) The room is old and the airconditioining barely works. The fridge doen't work and I'm still waiting for someone to come and repair it. I suppose I take some of the blame as I booked the room with one of the hotel aggregator websites (hotels.com), and I suppose as you got the room at a discounted price you are treated accordingly. It's a shame as they had many vacancies and still have - I booked a Superior and they still have plenty of Palace Club Suites available.......... According to hotels.com and wotif.com, the price difference is $100US per night yet when I enquired and offered to pay for an upgrade they wanted an extra $285US per night......... Very dissapointing as I take 2 o/s family holidays to Phuket and this could have easily have became my new fave destination. I suppose this is just a ploy to extract more dollars from unsuspecting guests", "I've stayed in countless hotels and the buffet breakfast wa the worst ever experienced..... basically inedible. The bacon had been fried until was like tree bark, the waffles were dry from having sat there for hours, the pastries were soggy and the potato wedges were dripping in fat. They were certainly focusing on quantity and not quality.", "The only saving grace are the staff which are very pleasant.", "I really intend eating outside every night as the thought of spending more money here doesn't sit well with me.\n", "\nWe stayed in a Deluxe room on the third floor for a period of 3 days during our visit. This hotel offers value for money compared to equally large hotels in Nusa Dua, at only $190US a night, I felt the price reflects what we got, probably just leaning on the overpriced side.", "We stayed during the busy peak season, and not to my surprise our room was not ready on check-in, we were offered 2 free drinks in the lobby bar and a few snacks to chew on while we waited. 30 minutes later we had a delightful porter show us to our room, as well as giving a quick guide of the resort and facilities on offer in the room, a tip well-earned for this young man!", "The Deluxe room was pretty nice, not outstanding, attention to detail in some parts were lacking, especially in the bathroom, where nothing was square. The amount of complementary amenities was quite generous, easily the most on offer in any other hotel I\u2019ve stayed at. A nice range of shampoos, soaps, shower caps, tooth brushes etc certainly made staying here just that little bit easier.", " I\u2019m so surprised at how many hotels still use dinosaur CRT TV\u2019s, not this place, a generous 42\u201d LCD takes price of place at the foot of the bed, with about 50 channels to choose from. The TV guide provided wasn\u2019t 100% accurate; some of the channels no longer existed or were on different numbers. ", "A guide to showing that\u2019s weeks movies would have been nice, but wasn\u2019t included, so you had to have a stab in the dark, and if you got something you liked, you were lucky. Another feature I would of liked, is a channel dedicated to show your racked up expenses during your stay, this always helps you watch your budget, and I find it extremely useful in other hotels.", "The room layout is modern, nice use of LED mood lighting, and the little station that controls all the lights is a great feature. The air-conditioner is absolutely freezing; we had it set on low every time and at night you are always snuggled up deep in the blanks next to your other half! Speaking about the bed, the bed and pillows were a bit firm for our liking, but we never had any real trouble getting to sleep.", "Room service offers a turndown service twice a day, early morning and late afternoon, so you\u2019ll never be short of dry towels and bottled water. One nice touch was a small handmade gift offered to us on our first night, never had that before and was a nice touch.", "The complimentary breakfast from 6:30am \u2013 10:30am is very generous if not a tad confusing. For some reason they scatter all the buffet breakfast options all around the room, with no clear labelling to what is were, so you\u2019re left wandering from spot to spot trying to find what you want! Once you do find it get your fill for the day, skip lunch and save yourself for dinner! The egg chef was a nice touch and made beautiful omelettes.", "One of the biggest let downs of this place was the concierge, I had a cut from a swimming pool at a previous hotel we were staying in, and needed fresh band aids, I went downstairs to get some and was rudely told they didn\u2019t have any, suuurreeeee :rolls eyes: So I was left to my own devices until the morning where I went to the pharmacy at Bali Collection (local shopping mall) and picked up a packet. Asking about their airport transfer, as listed in the hotel guide book, meet with blank stares, and was told to book a taxi\u2026Speaking about Taxis, here are two tips, do NOT pay the ridiculous hotel rates they offer, you can barter them down for one, but a cheaper option we found, was to take the free shuttle bus to Bali Collection, and get a taxi from there, you\u2019ll save yourself 10,000\u2019s INR for doing so, the hotel wants to charge you 150,000 INR just to get into Kuta, doing it our way will cost you 80,000 INR.", "We had dinner at Chess Restaurant and the pizza bar by the pool, people below have mentioned they felt it cost too much, well if you come from Australia, the meals are very affordable in my eyes, even the mini bar is well priced IMO compared to Australia, so we got stuck right in. They didn\u2019t refill the mini-bar during our stay, so if you drink everything there is, you\u2019ll have ring room service to fill it up again.", "To conclude, even though this place offers itself as a 5 star, it is not, I give it a solid 4 star, maybe just a 4 \u00bd star, it\u2019s just missing those few key customer service items and room amenities that push it to a 5 star.\n", "\nWe stayed here for 9 nights and had a great time. All staff were very friendly and polite. If we had 1 complaint it was that that the bed was hard, but on request a mattress topper was very quickly put on. We loved the spa lap pool, I enjoy swimming so was able to get plenty of exercise. The facilities were excellent. We enjoyed hiring the bicycles out, and we see so much more of the area by doing so. We would definantly choose this hotel again. Location was perfect for getting about.\n", "\nMy husband and I spent nearly 4months hunting every nook and corner of Tripadvisor for a Best Pick of the Resort fit for Honeymoon at Bali ! Must say, the efforts were worth it . Nusa Dua treats Honeymoon Couples with a comfort and care which speaks for finest hospitality to Guests.

There is nothing negative that I could point during my stay of 4nights and 5days. Their private beach is best for spending quality time with your loved one . They have this amazing shack type beds on the beaches from where you can enjoy the spectacular sea view for endless hours. The cleanliness and maintainance of the entire Resort is definitely of high standards.", "Nusa Dua Resort also provides timely pick up and drops at specified timings throughout the Day to the local Mall - \"Bali Collection\" which boasts of abundant eateries covering mostly all major cuisines of the world .An incident worth mentioning here would be of an evening after dinner at one of the eating Joints at Bali Collection we were caught up in a heavy shower and as a result , missed the last bus back to the Hotel . As we were contemplating the options available for returning back , the kind hotel staff offered us a ride to the Hotel with their own Transport without any monetary benefit !!! If it were not for them, I'm sure we would be totally drenched walking from Bali Collection to the Resort . This act of kindness shall always stay etched in our minds .", "In short , if you do have a penchant for genuine Hospitality , serene surroundings and want to laze amidst tranquility , Nusu Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is just the place . An early booking is always recommended to keep the wallet light :)\n", "\nMy husband and I stay 4 nights at this Hotel during our Bali vacation.

I would prefer Nusa Dua next time.", "This hotel has a greatest garden I have ever seen in my life , like a paradise. This garden has a soul.

I really liked the traditional rooms , flowers and all colours are adorable.", "Hotel has big and very nice swimming pool . But Spa and spa sw\u0131mming pool was so nice.", "Breakfast was very succesfull , delicious and many kind of food was available to everyone.", "I like the back garden at the beach side.

See is not that much grazy blue & green . But it is not hotel\u2019 s fault.", "Everyone was really helpful and professional . we really loved them.

Thank you nusa dua beach hotel\n", "\nIt was amazing that we could spend 2 nights here in Nusa Dua Beach hotel, as a matter of fact, we really want to extend our stay at this beautifull hotel. While other hotels tried to be as modern as they can, this hotels remains the balance between traditional and also modern. The staff was very very very friendly, as if we are the king. Start from the very first arrival until the end of our stay, they treat us fairly or even better!", "We got the room facing the central stage area at 1st level. It was a great modern room, and yet so comfy, just feels like home. The bathroom was so modern, and yet the shower was extraordinary 'rain' type. It was so minimalist, yet still comfort enough to use and clean. These guys really take cleanliness as their number one issue. We had our room made up for three times a day, and yes they refill all the bath amenities so you dont have to worry will run out of bath gel or shampoo. They give you enough! The bed was also big enough to fit me and our baby, so we don't have to push one another around just to get enough space room. It's like there's never ending wow experience with this hotel.", "They situated not too far from the Nusa Dua entrance gate, but quite far from the Bali Collection mall, where you can get more restaurant options beside theirs. To get there, you need to wait for a shuttle bus that pick and drop you up from and to the hotel. They have wonderfull scenery at their main gate, which you can use as your photo background. The ambience is also quite and relaxing, for those who looked for an oasis for a beautifull relaxing trip, this is the place!", "The breakfast was VERY GOOD, they have so much menu choice from local to japanese. And yet the tastes is so GREAT too! Yet, nothing to talk much about this part. Since, we love to eat! And yes, it fits us out. Not to forget, we also have the welcome drink at the lobby, which is also awesome to enjoy and start your journey there.", "The swimming pools was also clean and comforting, with our baby on his own swimtrainer ring didn't want to get out from the pool. They have 2 main swimming pool, one is the standard square-like pool, and the others is beach-like pool who had sandy beach side at the edge of the pool. Our son was love to play around the sand with his feet. And not to forget the sandy beach, it was so comforting. We even had a chance to see the sun rise at the early morning with clear sky (luckily). But the sea is only good to swim at the morning til noon, since at the afternoon they go low on tide (maybe its seasonal effect). Since the weather is cold breeze windy in the morning, we decided not to swim at the sea to keep our son cold. But we let him play with the sand at the beach, and yes the water is chill.", "Overall, what we love is the bedroom that is so comfortable! The bathroom is being part of what we love about it. They're just amazed us. We also decide to follow your bathroom interior design guys, just to remind us where we have been before. It was so inspiring. It was clean and fresh everytime we enter the room. The so-so side is that we have to get the corner room, but is also the best since we still have our newborn who are still had his cholic sometimes. One more thing, the food/drink price is quite expensive for my side, so either you manage to brought it from the outside, or bring extra cash (maybe this is how they maintain the taste afterall).\n", "\nHave just spent a fantastic 8 days at this resort. Staff are terrific and cannot be more helpful. Hotel facilities are great, as is the buffet breakfast. I had a lovely room (think it was an upgrade). All in all a lovely experience. I will return!!\n", "\nThey have 2 amazing pools with a swim up bar and you cam have a romantic dinner on the beach .. But The rooms are average.\n", "\nThankyou Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for such a lovely stay.", "4 nights at your stunning resort is never enough. Once again we sampled everything Nusa Dua Beach had to offer.", "Yummy cocktails at the pool bar, relaxing massage, fun watersports, fantastic food and all the great activities on offer down at your sports centre (Bike riding and tennis were our favourite!)", "The resort is looking amazing after your upgrades and we look forward to coming back again.", "Michelle Smallwood & Chris Parry\n", "\nWe came here on a singapore/bali combo. This was a lastminute booking and we were amazed. We didnt realise this was one of the small hotel of the world when we booked it and were pleasantly surprised!!!! The staff were pleasant..there were plenty of pools to chill by. There are 6 restaurants to choose from each serving good quality food. The rooms were basic but comfortable..we had a standard room. The value for money was the best. Also its in a peaceful area and away from the party areas of Bali...I would recommend this hotel to anyone\n", "\nNeeding just a one night stay on our journey back home from a holiday in Lombok, we booked a Superior Room at this hotel through Agoda at a cost of \u00a391. The room was situated at the back of the complex, took us ages to figure out how to get back to reception or anywhere else from it, but, for one night, we knew we wouldn't have a prime position. The room was desperately in need of refurbishment. It was musty, the bathroom was dated; the bath (with shower over) was stained, had a rusty bath plug, black, mouldy sealing around it and it took almost 30 minutes before the water turned from black to clear. The bath also leaked and so after a shower the floor was completely flooded. The room boy told us it always did that! The furniture in the room was scuffed and worn and one night there was one night too many. Because of this, we chose to dine away from the hotel so spent nothing more during our short stay than the cost of the room. Breakfast the following morning was good, but the check out was poor - the computers were down and it took ages to obtain an account showing a nil balance. The clerk didn't seem to believe this, and said she would email us if, once the computers were up and running, it should show that we owed them anything. This, in front of a queue of people! Needless to say, no email has arrived as we owed them noithing. One of the receptionists asked if we had enjoyed our stay and when we told her about the state of the room she said it's because we had booked a Standard Room. I politely said no, we had booked a \"Superior Room\", but you have housed us in a \"Sub Standard Room\". She then just smiled and told us to \"have a good day\". Having stayed on three separate occasions in Bali at the Grand Bali Hyatt, the Intercontinental and the Kamandala, and on our outward trip this time at Poppies, where the standards at all were excellent, our experience at the Nusa Dua Beach bore no resemblance to any of those hotels, nor, indeed, to any of the numerous hotel we have ever stayed at in South East Asia. This hotel is most definitely in the third rate, package tour category, and if this is the standard of room they put people in on short stays then they don't deserve passing business. Also, if this is the type of accommodation agreed by the likes of Agoda, then neither shall I use them again.\n", "\nWe have stayed at Nusa Dua beach resort for 6 nights. First night we stayed at Superior room which is old unrenovated room. Room was clean however matress was very tough & pillows are lumpy, so i've complained about it next morning to the duty manager who took care of it straighaway (Thank you) & offered us to be upgraded to Deluxe room (renovated room). Deluxe room are more spacious & modern, with nice modern bathroom, however matresses were still very tough(felt like sleeping on the floor) & pillows were also lumpy, so we didnt have a good night sleep for 6 nights. Breakfast is nice but needs more variety of bread(they had only variety of white breads), cheese (had only 1 type of cheese) & salami(had only ham & chicken roll), & if you want to order eggs benedict it is extra charge. My children went to kids club which they thought was boring due to stuff being a little lazy to do anything exciting with kids. Mostly they were watching TV, so my kids didnt want to go to club as they wanted to be more outdoors. They had lunch at kids club which was fine but the price of juices was the same as price of lunch which we found out about at the check out ( i think it's a little too expensive to pay for a glass of apple juice $5 AUD)", "We didnt use spa or salon facilities due to being over priced, if you go to town you'll find that spa prices 50% cheaper than at the resort, so as restaurants are very expensive, so we didnt eat in the resort, we had to go outside. Other than that nice resort.\n", "\nThis is one of the original resorts in Nusa Dua. It has a beautiful Indonesian feel. So many of the other resorts only make a passing nod to Indonesia. The staff are exceptional and make you feel like part of their family. It is definitely worth paying the extra for Palace Club which covers full breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails and nibbles. Everything is presented beautifully and exceedingly generous. The gym and spa area are excellent. Everything is spotless and meticulously kept. It is one of the most relaxing holidays you could have. I have been there in 2009/2010 and just returned two days ago. I am already planning 2012!\n", "\nWent for our honeymoon and it was perfect. Loved the gardens and spa services.

The service and the staff at the Palace Club remain impeccable.\n", "\nWe had our wedding at the Nusa Dua, and it was beautiful. The staff was so kind and attentive and did a great job. We felt like we were treated like royalty. We stayed in a palace club room, which was so comfortable, and the breakfast, tea, and cocktail buffet in the afternoon were all excellent. We also had two spa packages, and the spa was the best we've been to.\n", "\nWe stayed here on our way back from Australia in January '11.

Bali seems to stop at the guarded gates that lead into the Nusa Dua area where everything is safe and pretty much manufactured.", "We didn't eat at the resort, instead we went outside the gates to a nearby market area to eat, easily 80% cheaper than the resort restaurants.", "Overall a great experience. Regards to the staff, The Truly Awesome Concierge Guys and the Spa ladies who helped iron out our Backpacker knots\n", "\nExcellent room, view, service, amenities, location, guest activities", "can't think of anything that went wrong!\n", "\nWe stayed at this hotel for 7 nights. We were accommodated in one of the un-furbished superior rooms, which was quirky and had everything needed. The bed was amazing. The best sleep I have had on a holiday. We saw one of the re-furbished rooms and I must say I liked the older rooms better. The staff were sensational and extremely helpful. The breakfast was amazing and included everything you needed to start the day. We will definately be back. Thank you to all the staff who made our holiday wonderful.\n", "\nAlthough people in Bali call Dreamland another place, still this hotel qualifies for dreamland description. Outstanding service, polite staff, romantic pool bar and many other things will make You enjoy your stay.", "The rooms are spacious, we were concerned about the construction works mentioned by other travellers, but actually it was not noticeable that half of the hotel was undergoing some reconstruction everything was neat and quite. The breakfast had a vast choice of dishes both oriental and also international. The Bar was a little overpriced, but still it is cool to enjoy cocktail sitting in the pool bar. ", "There was an outstanding selection of restaurants for dinner and lunch still the prices were a bit on the high side. But it is very easy to take free shuttle bus to Bali Collection and enjoy excellent food for very affordable prices. ", "There is just one thing to be worried about \u2013 do not expect blue lagoon beach! Although there are beach boys cleaning the beach continuously the water is full of waste and garbage particularly after storms or heavy wind. ", "Still if You want value for money vacation with outstanding service \u2013 just go for it!\n", "\nFor a 4 1/2 **** it was okay. Beautiful place, service for our rooms was great. Staff at the desk, some confusion. It's worth it to upgrade to the palace rooms so you get free drinks & food at the happy hour. Would I stay here again................. No\n", "\nI travelled with my 16 Year old daughter and we were pleased with our choise. We upgraded to the Palace room which included breakfast, high tea, cocktails in evening, delightful staff - could not have been more welcomed if we wanted! The choise of restaurants was excellent from Pizza to Japanese to tradtional Balinese cuisine. The pool facility was immense with plenty of lounge chairs to find. The beach was lovely and staff cleaned the sand daily. One word of warning - the balinese locals have a massage unit at end of complex and tend to be a bit pushy! just dont go there. The Spa facility was second to none, with lap pool lounge chairs to relax in peace and quite. All in all we had 8 days at the Beach Hotel and did not want to come home.\n", "\nIt's the second time for us at Nusa Dua Beach this time we brought our 2 young boys (6 & 4) with us. Our kids were well look after by all the staff and enjoyed the kids club, kids pools (3 of them) and the main pool where they loved sitting at the pool bar and having mocktails. We also loved the pool bar as part of it is close to the kids pools that we could watch the kids whilst having a bintang or 2. They also have a kids playground, beautiful gardens, beach access and temple to explore, lets just say the kids we anything but bored.", "The staff are all so friendly and helpful, they delighted in providing the boys with food to feed the fish every morning.

Not to mention the spread at breakfast - the omlettes are surperb.", "We're just counting down the days when we can return.\n", "\nA comfortable hotel with traditional design nestled in one of the best location at Nusa Dua. Large and lush swimming pool shaded by palm trees, lots of activities either for adults or kids. This hotel also has its own crystal-clear private beach just few steps from the rooms.

The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly! ", "The room was good very well appointed with a king bed which was 2 singles pushed together only complaints was it was a little firm.

The shower and toilets were always well cleaned with fresh supplies replenished daily.", "The places to eat at the hotel are clean and the staff and provide good service. The food is top class and is kind of expensive compared to the rest of Bali but you are paying for quality. The morning breakfast buffet was fantastic and had the biggest selection of fresh fruit and foods daily with these changing daily.", "The pools were fantastic and were a great way to wind down after a long day walking and shopping. The resort is in a secured complex that lies within the secured area of Nusa Dua we felt very safe here at all times.", "The resort's beach isn't very nice but is good to explore at low tide if you are after water sports this is the place to be with all the activities available right at the beach.", "Over all we enjoyed the peace and quiet and the space the resort offered the gardens and surrounds were well kept. As I said above the only detraction was the renovations that were occurring. Over all I would definitely recommend this resort and would stay here again if coming to Bali again.", "Transport from the hotel to the air port and vice versa should only be around 100,000 in taxi or private transport.\n", "\nMy wife and I stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa 5 years ago and had a really great stay. We have since been holidaying in other Asian countries up to 3 times per year.", "As we had family who have 2 small children who wished to holiday with us over Easter we decided to choose Bali as the flying time from the east coast of Aus is only approx 5.5 hours. We booked this Hotel again based on our wonderful stay 5 years ago and we were not disappointed.", "If you like the hustle and bustle of Kuta this resort and location is not for you. The location is excellent and only a short walk away from Bali Collection where you can find all the copy designer goods as you would find in Kuta but a little more expensive, and what I mean by more expensive in terms of Aussie dollars is minimal. There are also plenty of restaurants to choose plus outside the entry to the Nusa Dua Resorts is also a small village with a market atmosphere with local restaurant options. ", "A taxi to Kuta is approx 100,000 IDR and if the traffic is not too congested will only take 20mins.", "The Hotels accommodation is currently being renovated with no disruption to the hotel's operation and facilities as they are completing a wing of accommodation at a time. The refurbished deluxe rooms are modern and well appointed; the bathroom design around the shower is not great as water leaks all over the floor when you use the shower, a clear design fault.", "The 2 lagoon pools are a good size with plenty of sun lounges around both pools and in front of the well manicured gardens and sandy beach, never any problems finding a sun lounge and the pool team always there to assist and offer food & beverage service.", "All the food we ate in a variety of the Hotel's restaurants and Bars was a very high standard, though I would have liked to see a different dinner and lunch menu at Chess Bar and Restaurant as when you ate at the Bar in the day it was the same menu in the outside Restaurant in the evening. They have just appointed a new Executive Chef who I believe is a Australian who I am sure will keep the high standards of food being offered, lets hope he reviews the offering of some of the menu's and as a suggestion add a variety of fresh Subs or Sandwiches for lunch menu which are a great option on a hot day.", "The day spa is a must, this has recently been upgraded and a great way to indulge. The facilities also include a beautiful lap pool and spa cafe, and only persons above the age of 12 years allowed.", "The Hotel's biggest asset is the staff. There is many staff that has worked at the Hotel for more than 20 years and offer true Balinese hospitality with a smile.", "We can recommend this resort to any couple or family who are after a great value holiday in Bali just outside of lively Kuta; whilst you will find cheaper places it would be hard to beat the service and facilities on the beach.", "We are planning to book and return in July!!! Love it!\n", "\nWe have been staying at this hotel for 16 years and it nevers fails to disappoint. The caring staff treat all guests as though they are old friends. Rooms are always clean, amenties incl water stocked up daily, beds tunred down each night. The food provided at the restaurants and room service is tasty and plenty of choice even for the kids. The spa centre is heaven from facials to massages. Gekkos Kids Club caters well for the children with fun activities incl cycling, fish feeding and cooking - our son enjoys meeting kids from other countries there. There is a great running track past all of the hotels, best early morning before its too hot, plenty of outdoor activities eg snorkeling, canoeing. The cooking class at Raja's is a must but dont eat breakfast that morning!! 5min walk to Shopping Mall and local villages for shopping and eating. We have recommended many people to stay here and none have been disappointed. Looking forward to returning in June to see the renovations.\n", "\nStayed at the Resort for a week -- great experience -- lovely beach front except of you are looking for waves you dont get them here. The beach front is very calm which means you do find a lot of weeds in the water.

Great lareg room with good facilities.\n", "\nOur stay at nusa dua was great. I was travelling with my mom and my sister and we really took avantage of the pool and beach. The food was excellent at each restaurant and even by the pool. Our room was a triple that was just remodeled. Our only complaint, also shared by many other guests, was the remodeled shower. The tub is very slick and deep. My mom and I both fell in the shower. Although comical we were both a little injured. Also, the glass they installed only covers a small portion of the tub so", "It is impossible not to get water everywhere! Everyday we soaked the floor. The breakfast in the morning was really good. There wasn't much going on for activities, so if your looking for quiet and calm this your spot.\n", "\nMy family and I stayed here for 4 nights. The resort is lovely, very traditional but HUGE! Our Rooms were nice and clean- a little far from the pool but that's only cause the the resort is so big. The breakfast is unbelievable- hands down the best I have ever had. The staff are lovely but that's just Bali people, they're all lovely. Nusa Dua is a lovely area to stay if you prefer to be away from all the hustle and bustle but is a nightmare in traffic during peak traffic times to get back to. I would definitely come back and stay here at this hotel.\n", "\nA terrible end to a beautiful holiday!!! Awful hotel, very unhelpful staff who knew nothing about their own facilities or the local area. It's a building site, ugly and overly expensive for the service you get!!! There are so many hotels in this area that you can choose a lot better. I wouldn't reccommend this hotel at all and was very glad to leave it!!!

We were happily upgraded on our arrival only to find we were placed in the oldest rooms in the place. Half the hotel is under construction and our room faced it all. The noise was more evident when the balcony doors were open. We were given a twin room by mistake. Instead of moving us to a queen/ king bed they proceeded to join the two single beds. This wasn't very comfortable. ", "The staff are just beautiful, happy and very helpful. We didn't complain as we spent most of our time around the spa area. They have a wonderful lap pool and top class gym. Complimentary water and beans around the pool was lovely.

", "The restaurants and spa treatments are extremely expensive when compared to the outside the resort. We did eat a couple of times at the italian restaurant and chess bar. Food was nice but a bit pricy. If you get breakfast included it is vast and delicious the variety from asian, european and english fry ups is great. ", "I would recommend a stay here once all the construction is finalised. The new part looks lovely and if you do find the restaurants and spa pricey there is a free shuttle buss to Bali Collection, where you can get a variety of restaurant to dine in. A short walk out of the resort will take you to the main streets for some cheap shopping and treatments.\n", "\nWhen you arrive to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, you are immediately in awe of the beauty and details around every corner.

We ate lunch at two (Chess Bar and Sandro's Pizzeria) and of course ate the fantastic breakfast 'buffet' at the Wedang Jahe restaurant. We cannot even begin to tell you how much we looked forward to the breakfast every morning! Such a variety and outstanding food! A tip would be to eat breakfast as late as you can manage to hold you over until dinner. Also, check for monthly specials at the hotel's restaurants. Upon arrival, you may be given a complimentary drink voucher, it is a nice mix of juices, but is non-alcoholic. ", "The pools are clean and refreshing. There are plenty of lounge chairs by the pools and on the beach, but you may want to save a spot early enough to have a place in the shade. There is hotel beachside service with just the raise of a flag. Also, the locals will be selling souvenirs on the beach- just politely say 'no thanks.'

Mats are provided.", "Complimentary bottled water was replaced every day. Turn-down service was a nice touch. You may have a balcony close to another room's balcony.

There are plenty of sun lounges around and ample shade. The beach is lovely, but you can't really swim unless you like a lot of seaweed.", "The rooms were nice and clean, but I kind of expected more. Not that big, especially not the bathroom. They also had one of those 'half' shower screens so water went everywhere. So they were good, but not great.", "Restaurants were the same as all resorts.

For dinner, I highly recommend Mai Mai, Nyomen's Beer Garden, or the Tree (all only a few minutes away) as they will pick you up from the hotel and drop you back again for free. Good food, well priced. There is also a really cheap convenience store near Nyomens & Mai Mai as well.There is nowhere close to walk for lunch/dinner, so if this is important to you don't stay here.

It is a very open and quite luxurious hotel, with a grand lobby, recently renovated deluxe rooms, fantastic sports centre and lovely pools. , One of the best things about this hotel was the friendly staff. I can honestly say that everyone was so polite and went out of their way to do everything they could to make our stay special. There was plenty to do if you want to be active (tennis courts, squash courts, table tennis, pool table, chess tables, spa, lap pool, basketball, bikes for hire etc), as well as daily scheduled activities to join in to if you want. We managed to get a very good room rate, and it wasn't too expensive to eat and drink at the hotel (in fact we didn't leave for the whole weekend) and the quality of the food and drinks were excellent. The gardens are manicured and well maintained. There were further renovations still going on while we were there (rooms only), but although we were told there was work going on, we did not hear a thing! We would definitely recommend this hotel and hopefully we will be able to return there for another holiday in the future.\n", "\nJust returned from 9 glorious days in Bali all spent at the Nusa Dua hotel. Yes, it is expensive but when booking a 5 star then surely that is to be expected. Breakfast was superb and enough to keep me going all day.

The sea however, because protected by a reef is very shallow and the bottom not very pleasant to walk on but, the hotel pools more than made up for this.", "The staff were delightful, though I must say I found the trainee staff (there were many of them) far more pleasant that the permanent staff.

", "we booked our trip with AsiaLuxe Holidays and what a find they were, especially Darrell Clausen, a consummate pro. will be booking all future asia trips with him. he went above and beyond in answering our questions and concerns and made some great recommendations for restaurants (Bambu Bali..go there) and shopping.", "they use bhi tours & travel in bali for transfers,tours,etc. we were met promptly at the airport by Made Widya, their top tour guide , who we developed a relationship with over the course of a week by using him for day long outings. What a great guy !!!\n", "\nWe enjoyed our 6 nights at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel. The hotel itself is very pretty, more Balinese style than others around it. The grounds are beautiful. The rooms are fine, nice flat screen TV's and nice little balconies. The main pool with the swim up bar is really nice. The other pool needs the bottom painted and it would also be very nice. The staff were all very friendly, attentive, and helpful. The location on the beach was very good (though we have been to nicer beaches in other countries). The breakfast buffet was really, good ,though we always ate too much. We would recommend this pretty hotel especially to anyone trying to stay within a budget.\n", "\nThis hotel is located in a secluded area with only five star hotels in Nusa Dua. The surroundings, garden, pool area, beach area, lobby, entrance are really impressive and beautiful. However, the rooms (superior) were average (I would say three star hotel). Our room and balcony needed an up fresh; there were stains on the wall and the furniture and the floor were worn out. Keep in mind that you will be forced more or less to the high prices at the hotel restaurants. There are no cheep local restaurants (warungs) in the area. If you would like to find more to choose from you will have to leave the area and take a walk for about 15-25 minutes to find other restaurants with lower prices (however still high prices for Bali). The water bottles are not included in the hotel price, which with regard that you cannot drink tap water is very cheap. We did take one bottle of water from the mini bar and had to pay 75.000 IDR (ca 9 USD) for that bottle! Can you imagine? A bottle like that cost normally around 4.000 - 10.000 IDR (ca 1 USD). Let's talk about a gross margin of 900%! Shame on you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel! I think it's really rood; not even a bottle of water in our hotel in Gothenburg costs so much. I think it\u2019s nice to see Nusa Dua for 2-3 nights but I would not go back there again. For my taste it is too isolated and expensive area; you will not get to know Bali there. If you go with your family and children to Nusa Dua their high prices can ruin you quickly. There are lot of greater places on Bali.\n", "\nThis was a nice hotel with good helpful staff. Everything was clean, location is right on the beach, no real complaints. Im generally not one for \"sit on a beach/at a pool and relax\" holidays, but this was a very nice place to spend one. About the only downside I found was that the restaurant selection in the resort is a bit limited, and it is a bit of a pain to go out of the resort (other than a free shuttle to a local shopping mall, which has a selection of restaurants, but why stay in a resort if we was to take the shuttle outside to eat?) One night we took a taxi from the hotel to Kuta (100k fixed price to get there, but you are on your own to find a ride back) for dinner, which was a nice change.\n", "\nWe traveled from the US West Coast for a short trip to Singapore (2 nights) and Bali (3 nights). It took almost 36 elapsed hours to get from San Francisco to Bali but we found the Nusa Dua very comfortable and relaxing once we got there. The package we arranged for the trip through a travel agent was very reasonable. The architecture reflects the culture and the grounds were beautiful and well maintained.", "There was a choice of at least 6 restaurants and we tried most of them, except for the high end restaurant. Overall, we found a good variety of food choices, but our favorite meal of the day was the breakfast buffet.", "The service was generally friendly and efficient, but was somewhat disjointed at times, possibly because some of the staff were somewhat limited in English.", "The resort seemed to be about half full while we there, which meant that we did not have to contend with large crowds on the beach, at the pool, or in the restaurants.", "We found this resort to be a very good value and were happy with our stay. If you demand a 5-star resort, you will probably want to look elsewhere.\n", "\nThis is the great ever hotel !!! Very reflexing,every morning, when i went out to the balcony, i will see some ducks catching around at small garden. Beautiful private beach ! Nice and delicious breakfast, friendly staff . I stay up to 5 days! Thats was a memorable holiday with Family. They provide us wheelchair for our grandmother that hardly to walk. They do very fast service. I don't mind giving them a lot of tips. =) Will come again this coming Holiday !\n", "\nI stayed here with my mum on our way to New Zealand. We did not really know what to expect but were blown away when we arrived. From the onset the staff provided amazing service which was friendly, helpful and efficient. The hotel was beautiful and the grounds were lovely, we can't really fault them.

But once found there are plenty of alternative places within easy walking distance. ", "I usually travel on a shoe string and like to rough it so booking this hotel was a change for me due to having my mum with me, with that in mind I would not have changed the experience. The hotel also organised us a trip around Bali, up to the volcano and to the rice fields etc. This gave us the opportunity to see a lot with my mum still feeling comfortable and with no stresses what so ever.\n", "\nRecently stayed for 10 days (husband, wife + 10yo + 12yo). Very friendly staff. Great location (5min walk into Nusa Dua village). Beautiful garden grounds(which our rooms overlooked), espectially at rear of \"Special members Club\".

Beautiful Balinese \"gates\" as you approach the hotel, and a wonderful large, and more traditional style foyer.

Furniture and bathroom a bit dated (but not \"bad\") and rear-projection TV took up space - but all clean, and very acceptable. If you don't want the rooms that haven't yet been revamped, then just pay the extra ($30USD/night) and upgrade to a newly renovated. We didn't bother as we were very happy where we were.", "Breakfast - good choice to suit most.", "Restaurants - could benefit from having some daily specials, just to give some variation. Italian dinner buffet looked fabulous, but the standard of the dishes presented were a let down.", "Staff were invariably friendly, especially to the children (perhaps it helps by being friendly to them!) - in fact the only rude people there were some of the eastern European guests!", "Beach is safe and picturesque - just a bit ratty several hundred metres south close to the Nusa Dua headlands.", "Would have been nice if the hotel had a \"happy hour\", but then it was only a 3 minute walk to the Laguna where they have a daily 6-8pm 50% off all drinks!", "Would certainly return.\n", "\nit seems all the reviews were written by the hotel staff,cause i cant find any word of truth.the hotel's beach is dirty and u cant swim there in case of low tide,in morning it's around one and half meter high,but full of algae,in afternoon water runs so far away,till reef.we're walking for 20 min in this hot weather to the other hotels' beaches.breakfast is very poor and every day is the same.all the facilities in hotel re quite expensive.they charged about 45 USD for putting plaster and ice on finger.hotel is the oldest in nusa dua,beds,TV,bathroom re from other century, terrible.there were always some wood insect in our room.and what i must say-during our one week holidays i've heard about more then 5 cases of money stealing,and finally we fall victim to this.forgetting some small money in room,be sure u'll not find it coming back.then manager lies to your eyes that it's happened for the first time and send u fruits.can be ranged only like 3 stars,not more.\n", "\nwe stayed in th hotel foe 5 nights for our honeymoon.on checking in we were upgraded to palace club room.luxurious resort with number of in house restaurants to choose from.a beautiful beach with lots of sun beds and a large option of water sports to choose from.th best part was th morning breakfast with the largest spread i have ever seen.would recommend to all and love to go again !!! have a pleasant stay.\n", "\nMy husband and I visited this hotel in November 2010 and had an incredible time! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable vacation. I could go on about the resort, beach and food, which were all amazing! But what I think was most memorable about the place where the staff. Lovely, helpful and always smilling. I can't wait to go back at the end of this year!\n", "\nHad the pleasure of staying at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel twice this month, having stayed several times before. I have only ever stayed in a Palace Club room, so can only comment on that. Our visit was for two nights after a stay in Seminyak and Cepaka first, We always finish of our Bali holidays with a couple of nights in Nusa Dua or Jimbaran just to wind down and chill out. The Palace Club staff are just amazing and truly professiona, without being stiff. They are the most friendly staff who always remember your name and always give you a warm smile. The resort itslef is lovely and very traditional in comparison to some of the other resorts in the area. I guess the rooms are becoming dated, but they have some much character and I have always found them to be very clean and well maintained. There are no flat screen TV's or sound systems, but you do get a DVD player.The amenities are excellent and the towels thick and absorbent. The food and beverage on offer in the Palace Club is of a high standard and always a lot of variety. Each evening the canapes are based on a theme, which is really nice. The lounge is open 24/7, so you can pop in for a drink or biscuit or fruit any time you like. The breakfasts and high tea each day are also very good. I think what really makes Palace Club are the wonderful staff. They are happy to assist you with any request, and a really obliging. I had a stressful encounter at the domestic airport which they were happy to help resolve for me once back at the lounge. They made many calls for me a and spent a lot of time with me, which I truly appreciated. I highly recommend the Palace Club, and compared to other resorts, probaly the most affordable club on offer.\n", "\nThis hotel is the oldest in Nusa Dua. However, I find it to be quite charming because it also has the most character. The other cluster of hotels were definitely more updated--ie: the laguna has nicer beach beds and looked fancier. However, I was glad that this resort has a lot of character. Sometimes staying at one of the big chain resorts, it starts to feel like you could be anywhere because they all look the same in that nice, big hotel sort of way. At Nusa Dua, we were reminded everyday that we were in Bali because of the design of the resort. The entrance to the hotel is stunning at night. We took at shuttle past the newer hotels nearby and most looked pretty standard with convention posters up front and metal detectors like casinos. Although this hotel is older, they did a good job with the upkeep. The garden, koi pond and general landscaping were manicured perfectly. The rooms were clean. The beds were comfortable and the staff was very friendly. The spa (not to be confused with the hair salon) is also ranked very high. They were going through renovations during our stay near the pool area but we were not disturbed at all. I say stay here just for the more interesting design of the hotel if you're looking for a resort in the Nusa Dua area.\n", "\nHad the time of my life. The resort was absolutely lovely. Our rooms were massive for a one bedroom and were marble from floor to ceiling. Would recommend the buffet breakfast. Had a large selection of foods and with a beautiful view of the beach. Overall I would highly recommend this resort\n", "\nWear sunscreen even if it's cloudy! It was a beautiful resort and well kept, clean, quiet and the spa services were terrific. There is a check-out room for showering and relaxing after you have checked out. Nice shops at the resort, but no good local shopping nearby. Very affordable for the quality of this establishment.\n", "\nThis is set in the walled community that is Nusa Dua. The local shops are located just outside the gate and the tourist strip at Tangung Benoa is close by. One advantage is that nearly every restaurant we went to offered free transport to and from the hotel. There is also a shuttle to the shopping at Bali Collection. The room we had was absolutely fantastic. One of the best we have stayed in. The pool scene was quite lively with the obligatory swim-up bar. The breakfast buffet was quite pedestrian. A special mention to the staff at the customer relations desk in the lobby. They were more than helpful in arranging restaurant and transport bookings whether in the resort or outside in the town. They were also able to provide very good recommendations when we asked them.", "Because this is in a walled community, it is a bit of a walk to the shops unless you avail yourself of the free shuttle buses to Bali Connection or if you go to a restaurant that provides pick-up.\n", "\nThe hotel is the \"oldest\" of the newer huge resorts in Nusa Dua. You can tell the rooms are a little outdated, but still beautiful and traditional. The shower was great water pressure, and very modern. The spa was amazing...we did a half day treatment, and it was wonderful! It is directly on the beach, which was perfect for post dinner walking around. The restaurants at the hotel were ok. The staff cannot recommend any outside vendors to you, so you are on your own if you want to find another place to eat/spa outside of the hotel. The rooms were pretty big, and the lobby/entrance is absolutely breathtaking at night. It was a great value, as some of the other newer hotels down the beach were almost double! The staff was incredible in so many ways!\n", "\nBooked a suite in the palace club section and well worth the extra expense. Rooms, service and staff very impressive. Other areas of hotel were undergoing refurbishment but we weren't disturbed by this at all. As part of the package breakfast, high tea and cocktails included, so worth the exta.This smaller dining area was impressive and very relaxing. Staff were non intrusive and efficient. Hotel location right on the beach, and a walk way path accessible to all the other hotels in the area. Beach clean and sun lounges available but don't expect clear blue waters. Other reviews suggest this hotel feels like a complex and isn't really the real Bali and I'd agree. But there are many available tour experiences to book if desired, but if not, this hotel provides relaxation, beach side setting, fine dining and efficient staff. The suite was compact and traditionally furnished. A very sunny outside seating area and quiet outside garden areas were really picturesque. Bathroom large and great double walk in shower area. Handy walk in wardrobe and storage area in bedroom. I'd say the photos on the hotel web page made it look slightly larger than actually is, but not a criticism. Didn't make use of spa area in the hotel, but it looked like it was having a refurbishment, so can't comment. Sampled x3 of the restaurant eating sections of the hotel, all satisfactory and no complaints. Main pool areas as described, no obvious problems with sun lounger availability but we tended to go later in the afternoon. I'd recommend this resort for those enjoyimg a beach holiday setting, but if looking for more culture and the real Bali head for Ubud and some of the amazing hotels in that region.\n", "\nAfter spending 4 nights in Kuta and Ubud, we headed to Nusa Dua.", "We wanted to stay in a 5 star hotel for our final night in Bali, and so my parents and us (plus 1 child and a baby) went for NDBH. We read most reviews and thought that it was a safe choice to go for, but sad to say how wrong we were!", "We found our rooms (mine and my parents) flooded!", "What made it worse was that we discovered it only after my wife slipped and fell on the floor after she got up to reach for the lights (to pacify the crying baby due to thunder).", "After that commotion broke up, we had to spend the next one hour shifting rooms in the middle of the night!", "This experience has really shaken us up quite badly since we had never experience this before after having been to Bali for 3 previous trips (in fact, never in all our travels!).", "It also left a bad taste for us, since it was my parents first trip to Bali.", "It totally ruined our holiday after that!", "I somehow could not accept the ensued explanation of heavy downpour of rain. ", "Surely, a 5 star hotel would have been more prepared to handle such thunderstorms, which is not even close to a tsunami!", "In any case, I am not about to find out in my next trip to Bali.\n", "\nI choose this hotel after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor, let me say this was a very good decision, the hotel is stunningly beautiful and is made in traditional bali style, I had booked the trip through a travel agent and the trip was very well organized we stayed there for 5 days from 15th to 19th Dec , the hotel staff was friendly and smiling always ready to help, I just have two complaints first the lift outside our room was not working so we had to walk a long way and second the hotel beach was not clean but I think that was out of the hotels control as it was rainy season, lastly with the ever increasing flow of Indians the hotel could use an Indian counter at the breakfast buffet, if you are going to bali stay here, bali is amazing and beautiful it has beaches, volcanoes, temples, palaces, culture, good food and friendly people.\n", "\nWe stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel in September, where we had arranged to get married. The Gardens and Balinese style certainly gives the wow factor, the staff are very helpful and nice, one half of the hotel was under enovation but this was hardly noticed at all, the pool and beach were perfect. The buffet breakfast was great, we also ate at the pizza restaurant, balinese restaurant and the beachside restaurant, and although it was quite pricey the food was fantastic. We also ate outside of the hotel by the main gate to nusa dua and at the bali collection, both of which were very good and better value. The wedding went as planned thanks to Dwi who was an absolute star in making sure everything was perfect for us, we got married in the tropical gardens and it was perfect! The spa at the front of the hotel is stunning and very relaxing with a lovely lap pool and superb service. Overall, this holiday was like paradise and holds some very special memories for us.\n", "\nOur brief, three-day trip to Bali was our first visit to the island in 20 years. Good heavens how it has changed, judging from the drive from the airport to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa. We stayed at this hotel 20 years ago, when it was almost new, owned by Indonesia\u2019s oil company, and virtually alone on the rather boring and featureless Nusa Dua peninsula. Now this area has several large cheek-by-jowl resort hotels and we certainly wouldn\u2019t have come here by choice - our cruise line booked it - and instead we would have preferred Amanusa or maybe Amandari, where we also stayed 20 years ago, or either of the two Four Seasons resorts on Bali. ", "Even so, we liked the Nusa Dua a lot. Yes, it is big, it is packagey, it isn\u2019t a genuine five-star, it lacks intimacy, it attracts families with young children, but it is a spectacular place to stay, with absolutely wonderful gardens. The beach isn\u2019t the greatest in the world, and can be a bit muddy-murky. Twenty years ago, the Nusa Dua had this stretch of sand all to itself. Nowadays it shares it with the the Westin, the Laguna and the Melia, none of which struck us as being any better and they lacked the Nusa Dua\u2019s \u2018Balinese\u2019 design. ", "Since our last stay, the pool area has been thoroughly remodelled - there are now two main pools - though we actually spent most of our time at the bliss-out beautiful and quiet spa pool. The spa area here is like being in an Aman-annex, a stunning set-up with world class facilities. And the grounds of the hotel are simply amazing, with fabulous Balinese temples, ornamental lily ponds and brilliant planting throughout. Of course, this is a mature garden with 20 years behind it as well as a team of gardeners who maintain and manicure it to something like Chelsea Flower Show standards.", "Very few rooms here have a proper pool or a sea view. The accommodation blocks stretch back from the beach and rise to four floors which might be the legal limit. Our room, 2014, was way back and in the cheapest category, yet it had an excellent bathroom, with a separate tub and walk-in shower, as well as a separate lavatory. There was stacks of storage space and a smallish balcony which, like almost all balconies here, didn\u2019t offer much privacy. Our only gripe with the room was the vast cabinet used to house the CRT TV set. However, now that the hotel has come under the ownership of the Sultan of Brunei, it is being renovated to bring it up-to-date without sacrificing its Balinese style.", "There\u2019s a wide choice of restaurants - we had an elaborate, expensive Balinese dinner and a more practical and more delicious bbq\u2019d prawn dish on our last night. Breakfast buffets were good, though not in the Four Seasons/Ritz-Carlton league of lavishness. ", "Overall, a pleasant stay, helped by some very attractive and efficient staff, though we wouldn\u2019t have wanted to stay much longer in such a big and busy place. It\u2019s only the packagey nature of the place that prevents me giving it five stars.\n", "\nI am completely overwhelm by Hospitality of Nusa Dua staff, Hotel location is amidst lush green tropical sorrounings, its beach side Resturants with live music adds flavor to mood,", "Breakfast is awesum, Overall it was a wonderful experience and without any hesitation i would strongly recommend this hotel\n", "\nI stayed in Nusa dua beach hotel during in november 2010.

The upgrade included breakfast, both buffet and order off the menu, an afternoon tea with tea sandwiches and dessert- (although we never participated in this offering our son did and he raved about it.)

Every evening local stalls of handicrafts sat within the hotel premises, that meant I could do all my shopping without breaking my budget or tiring my son. The beach was clean, neat and well organized, that meant no need to rush-rush somewhere else to catch a glimpse of the beach.

The restaurants serve a good variety of food and the prices are reasonable. The front office staff were very efficient and pleasant and they were always trying to make our stay more enjoyable. For a greater variety of local food try the restaurants at the \"Nusa Dua Gates\" which are a leisurely 5 minutes walk from the hotel. This is also a good place to purchase souvenirs and local handicrafts. This hotel is a great place to stay for luxury and relaxation at a reasonable price.\n", "\nI came here with my husband in March 2009 for my daughter's wedding.

We ate here several times in the evening. ", "The hotel prices for food and drink are quite high, but there are other places nearby at Bali Collection ,a shopping mall about 15 -20minutes walk away.

I can't wait to see the renovations to the Palace Club when we go back next year. The Palace Club was certainly excellent value for money, we rarely had to buy a meal whilst we stayed there.

The room we had was very spacious and comfortable and not too far from the pools. The pools were great and our son spent most of the day in one or the other! but the relaxing atmosphere was interupted at 11am each morning by loud 'Euro Pop' for the Aqua Aerobicss followed by volleyball!! I used the spa and had a lovely treatment. The spa is being refurbished at the moment so they are using some of the guest rooms - it was a shame as I couldn't use the spa pool. There is also work going on at the hotel to refurbish a whole section of rooms but it wasn't intrusive and the fact that half the hotel was closed actually made getting a sunbed in the morning much easier!! It must be very difficult when it's full. The staff were friendly and helpful. The only negative comment we have is that food and drinks were very expensive - but then it is a 5* hotel so this is to be expected. We tended to walk outside the Nusa Dua gates and eat in the local restaurants which were much cheaper. We also ate at a restaurant at the Bali Collective - a lovely 10 miunte walk from the hotal along the beach path - this was good but expensive, and at Jimbaran Beach - great for sunsets and fresh fish. Top tip - don't get a taxi from the hotel just walk outside the security gates and there's loads there. Our son (6) used the kids club but it was a real shame that there weren't more kids there for some sessions. THe kids club staff were very friendly and the range of activities was varied. All in all we had a great time.\n", "\nMy husband and I have just returned from our honeymoon at the Nusa Dua Beach hotel and we have had a wonderful time.

The open air lobby with koi ponds and lush green immaculate grounds, private beach, two pools and several wonderful restaurants make it so you almost don't ever want to leave the property. We availed ourselves of the spa services, several times and were very pleased. THe staff in general were polite, helpful and welcoming. My only complaints would be that the rooms were a bit tired and showing their age, especially the bathroom. The room and bath were clean just in need of update. The breakfast buffet was fairly extensive but had the same exact selections day after day which became pretty boring after the sixth day. All in all a very nice to place to stay and very good value for the money.\n", "\nI and my girlfriend stayed here in june for two weeks. Site location is good, clean beach and not any noise.

The service is overall ok but very uneven, sometimes you get the very nice cold towel before you order lunch in the restaurant and sometimes not. You could say the experience is different every time.", "That being said, we still had a very good stay without any problems which is good. The reason why i would not reccomend this hotel is that it's facilities (i. e. Pool area) are WAY to small concerning the amount of beds that it hosts and also the value for money factor. I'm totally familiar with expensiver rates in hotel areas, but come come, on 7 euro for a small(!) H\u00e4agen Dazs ice cream? During our stay the hotel was half full due to that they were renovating one half of it. I felt very lucky that it wasn't full because that would've made it extremely hard to get into the pool or into the breakfast area.", "Although this review is very pessimistic, the hotel itself is ok if you are aware of all this but of all hotels that ive stayed in around Asia, this was the most overpriced one. My advice is to try another and see if you get more for your money there.", "Pros:", "- friendly staff", "- clean beach", "- ok cleanliness of rooms", "Cons:", "- very dirty pool (green stuff growing on the walls)", "- small pools and area around them, concerning amount of guests the hotel can host", "- an extremely expensive place with low value for money", "- rooms are old and outdatded, felt like 3 star standard ", "- wireless WiFi should've been included on a high class hotel", "- transfer should've also been included in a high class hotel", "- insane room rate ( an extra 199 usd/night) for upgrading to a room closer to the pool with exactly the same standard, but a few squaremeters of more space\n", "\non the beach ,lots of sun beds. nice pool and gardens", "expensive drinks and food ,get on the free bus to the bali collection ", "just about 4 star\n", "\nWe stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 5 nights at the end of June. This was following a business trip so we wanted to relax, and we were pretty much able to do just that. This hotel is your standard beach resort. Unfortunately, it's currently under renovation.

You should definitely go eat at \"Bali Collection\", which is a 20 minute walk away (or free shuttle every hour from hotel). The complex has a number of tourist restaurants which are alot more affordable. The hotel is also located right at the gates of the Nusa Dua complex so you can also walk out and browse some shops and restaurants. Breakfast was included and the buffer was pretty good, no complains there.", "The pools are very well maintained and pleasant to swim in. The beach however wasn't very nice. The sand was great, but the water itself was full of debris and algea which made swimming unpleasant and pretty much impossible. So if you want a good beach, look elsewhere!", "Overwall a decent hotel, but for the price I think I would've liked a bit more perks, like a better beach or free Internet, which I'm sure other hotels could provide.\n", "\nHotel with beautiful surroundings and beach. Workers were awesome. Manager was a pain in the rear, tried to charge us $70 (usd) for an upgrade. Restaurants offered decent food. Buffet breakfast got tiring after 2 days with the same items.

I booked on a last minute web site, and breakfast was included, each morning it was great way to start the day with a full buffet breakfast, including fruits, hot food etc. The kid\u2019s club offer a range of things to do, however, my daughter was not that interested I think it was more that she is shy rather than the activities on offer. The rooms need a make over, again however, they were comfortable. I asked for an additional pillow and it smelt of smoke, which was a little off putting. My son who is 15 asked if the hotel was an old palace, it does have feeling of old Bali grandeur about it, I liked it as although it is an old hotel it still feels very much like a Bali hotel, some of the newer hotels feel as if you could be anywhere in the world.\n", "\nI LOVED this hotel!

My kids had a blast

We loved the pool and the rooms were exquisite.

From the time we entered the resort it was as if we were in this enchanted world

The rooms were spacious

as ot is peaceful and serene, away from the bustling crouds, and at the same time close enough to the beach

It was my holiday visit and I stayed there for 2 days

And let's not forget the reception did perfect business ambience

The money which I spent was valuable. 

The hotel is paradise, spent some blissful time there

There was absolutely no delay in check in and check out

It was easy to locate

A large flat screen TV, DVD player, a large bathroom and last but not least a wonderful bed with great pillows for a few days of rain (monsoon season)

all facilities like hot water, geyser were available

All basic amenities were present in the room like fridge, TV, AC, bed, etc

TV, geyser, wi-fi, coffee maker and fridge was available in the rooms

The rooms are very spacious with TV, AC, fridge with attached mini bar

They did arrange all basic amenities in the room like TV, fridge, hot water, intercom, etc

All the different amenities of a 5-Star hotel with AC, TV and geyser were there and every thing was working properly

sujay n dina(d owners of raksh) are cool, must be taking lots of efforts to maintain d place

The room has a work area with composing materials, an expansive bed, a vast television, pot with tea offices, substantial storage room with protected, extensive bathroom with shower

The spacious rooms with comfortable bed full of pillows and flat screen TV

The rooms, staff state of mind, cleanliness is past applause

The highlight for me was their bathrooms fitted with a walk in cupboard! I would definitely recommend others to stay here and I myself would love to go back there one day

The room and the bathroom were cleaned properly

The bathrooms, toilets were so good I felt like stealing them

A place where nature, people and their hospitality take you to a different world which is really overwhelming

Visited goa after a long time with my life partner and felt the breeze of the beach at this scenic taj hotel

I have been to many countries and have stayed in many different hotels but the hospitality you get in India is worth your time and hard earned money

The money that I had spent at this hotel was value for money

It is worth the money spent, even though it is a little more expensive the others, but, then who says' that satisfaction comes cheap!!!

Massive rooms overlooking the pool club nothing was a problem for the staff and all bookings for the services offered at the hotel were very efficiently handled by the hotel staff

This wing has its own pool near the restaurant and the restaurant serves \"breakfast\" all day - so you don't have to wake up on time for the included breakfast

Variety of food with wide spread buffet breakfast,  lunch and dinner

Initially we selected the terrace rooms but eventually after seeing the diwa section got ourselves upgraded to a diwa room, which was slightly pricey but worth the money as it had much more space for my overactive one year old to run around and play :)

The room here was too good with a big soft bed, a sofa cum bed and a dry kitchenette with dining

The Diwa wing comes with its own privileges - All day Breakfast, Diwa only Pool, Bigger & Better rooms

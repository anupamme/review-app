Finally the day of the dinner, I spoke to the manager who also tried to convince me to have the buffet, which I also declined and stated I pre arranged this dinner so I would like to enjoy it. So he called the kitchen at 645pm and had it arranged for 8pm (which is what it was supposed to be!!! it was confirmed via email to me months prior to the trip).

Not even a tiny one. But the staff at the reception insisted there is a small little sign thats easily missed. Well, its invisible to me. I checked several times on our way in and out. 1st big problem is wierd odor in the room which were taken care of when they switched the room for us even thou it took ages for them to do so. We waited around 3 hours. And we are the only guest at the hotel. 2nd bigger problem is salt water for bath. The staff explained, according to their manager, the water is filtered and good for bath and washing, but not for drink or cooking. Not a good explanation thou. 3rd biggest problem is unfresh food served. We ordered nasi goreng for lunch. The tempura coated shrimp is a big dissapoinment. The color of the shrimp has turned black.

The concierge service is green and has a lot of room for improvement; personally I don't think they know what they are recommending or maybe they are just uninterested in service. There's also no way you can change foreign currency here because 'the hotel is not licensed'; meh! Finally beware of the 'free' photography offered by one of the shops; they charge you USD25 for every pic you want to be sent to you by email/burned on CD. That's a major ripoff for the unsuspecting and I am surprised that RC allows this to be promoted as part of guests' stay. The guests are not living in the dark ages and we know that the Internet is free and you can get a CD for less than a dollar! If I went to an outside professional photographer I get changes of attire for the shoot and probably free make up thrown in. ", "On the positive side, food was quite good.

We spent a lot of time there just enjoying the view and the sea breeze.The inifity pool effect could have been enhanced if they did not have all the umbrellas from the sundeck chairs pointing out in front of it.", "The beach itself is not that great and in fact was probably the most disappointing thing about the resort. The sand was coarse and as you get closer to the water, it becomes even more so. It is also not particularly clean with seaweed, shells and rocks on the entire stretch. There was also a long white bouy line across the water for what purpose I was not too sure; it might be safety or might be to keep larger objects from coming onto the beach, either way, it was not the most pleasant aesthetic in an otherwise very beautiful resort. I had assumed that as the resort is fairly new and parts of which were still under construction that this may only be a temporary issue. There were no water sports at the time we were there but I understand from the staff that they are looking into it. It would be great to be able to kayak along the coast though there is a pretty big wave break which people who do venture out into the ocean should be mindful of.", "The food by the pool is excellent and the staff regularly come over with complimentary shot glasses of smoothies and drinks and some tapas size snacks.

The place is so clean, every corridor and room smelling nice. The room is so nice you wouldn't want to leave it esp with its view of the sea. On the beach, its likewise clean and one can feel secured with the presence of hotel guards. The free breakfast is also very good and is something you look forward to every morning. The hotel personnel were very courteous and helpful with special mention to Ms Sherry who is stationed at the front desk. She made things very easy for us during our stay. The hotel should be proud to have her as one of its employees. The hotel security process is also commendable. They take the plate numbers of all taxis that comes in and out of the hotel for the guest's security. ", "I would love to go back there with my whole family if given the chance.

When the room was ready the staff brought the key to the gym picked us up from the gym with their buggy and sent us to our room - just perfect arrangement. The property is very big and on sprawling land scape so buggies come in handy for point to point transport.

Hats off to the management for setting the right values and culture. I want to give a shoutout to Christine, Richard and Radika for their exceptional service. Even the waiters at the F&B outlets are very sociable and made the effort to build rapport with the guests. The waiters at the Tapas Bar tried their best to promote their 'delicious' lunch menu even though we were just standing there taking pictures. ", "What some of the reviewers mentioned is true. The hotel still have some construction going on and not all facilities are in operation. But these are just minor details which does not affect the quality of your stay.

You can tell that the room layout was meticulously planned so that it was functionally spacious with it's modular doors, two layered blinds and ease of converting rooms to adjoining rooms (with their double door system outside the main door). Surprisingly, their suites are larger than their Pool Villas. On our 3rd night, we were upgraded to the Lagoon access suite which gives direct access to their plunge pool but we felt that there was limited privacy as all the lagoon access suites face the main access road. Each time a buggy drove pass, we could hear people talking, we weren't comfortable sitting at the daybed while passersby will be looking at us and we had to keep our blinds down all the time for privacy. I would recommend going with the Junior Suite instead of the Lagoon Access Suite. The bed is heavenly and fast WiFi speed.

This unpleasant check in process really changed our vacation mood from super duper excited to frustration. The next day we upgraded 2 of the rooms to pool access and luckily we can get them side by side so it lifted our mood a bit.

It was just the hotel was not really ready to operate as a 5 stars hotel or we probably expected too much because we stayed 2 nights in a boutique hotel in Ubud with excellent service prior to this hotel, so we thought Ritz Carlton would be on par or even better.

When you have to be transported in a buggy from one meeting to another in 33c hot bali weather, it makes for a very uncomfortable experience. Also with buggy and up and down the cliff by elevator, the logistics of going to places becomes cumbersome. ", "2. The check in and check out was subpar. For delivery of luggages took longer than 30 min. During check out, there was only one person handling everyone, it became a very long and unwieldy experience. Also the luggage pickup took longer mostly due to buggy logistics", "3. Inconsistent wifi. The wifi sometimes work and sometimes doesn't. Also the gym wifi doesn't work. ", "4. Bad ac system in main conference hall . Probably biggest gripe of all. That most business people are there and sitting for a long period of time makes for a very uncomfortable experience. Just for this, any conference organizer should ask for a partial refund given that any 5 star conference places should have decent ac system. ", "5. So-so breakfast. Food was ok, but the lights also went out which makes up for a subpar breakfast experience. ", "It's unfortunate that the experience was subpar. (Much of it hardware related as well). To note, some of the staff were excellent. Such as the buggy drivers (who remembers us by name) as well as the gym attendants that were very pleasant ( he gave us cold water and cold towel as we do our morning walk outside in the morning. ) ", "This hotel just opened 6 months ago, so some kinks to be fixed ( lots of kinks to be frank). But balancing between the hardware and software, the hardware was not ready to be displayed (my view, they should hold off doing any large scale events as they are ill equipped). Software is like a ritz Carlton. Hope they get better ( if not other hotels will be celebrating, cause they just a lost a supposedly competitor).

This was our first stay at any Ritz property so we had high expectations. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Eve whom was extremely nice and helpful. The check in process took about 10 minutes and was pretty smooth. The property prepared a cake with a macroon as a celebration for my girlfriend's birthday. Upon request, Eve was also able to relocate our room from the 6th floor to the first floor the following day where we had direct access to the pool! All the staff are extremely friendly and professional.", "One of the biggest complaint we have is being woken up each morning by noisy construction on the property. I would guess that 25% of the property was still under construction since the property just opened last Fall. This was quite disturbing and the noise continued for the remainder of our stay.", "Complaints about the property would be the lack of finishes in the room. Our sink was leaking and you could see the water collect behind the sink on the floor. One of the windows had leftover construction materials behind the shade (see picture). The ice bucket was damaged and was never replaced. The TV in the shower tub was broken and never attended to. Many parts of the property had cracks on the wall and ceiling and seemed unfinished. The first room we had also was a bit dirty. The tub had residue and some yellow gunk that was not cleaned. They also left dirty white slippers with the robe. Some of these complaints are easy fixes but shouldn't have been there in the first place because its the 'Ritz'.", "The best part of staying at the Ritz would be the service. It was exceptional.

", "The worst part of our stay was the rusty orange/yellow water streaming out of the bathroom sinks, tub and showers in THREE different rooms. In our first room with the orange water problem, it took 3 phone calls over a 45 minute period and finally we had to go back up to the front desk (not a simple 5 minute walk at this expansive property) to talk to them to complain. At first the front desk staff were completely indifferent and asked what we wanted them to do. When I insisted to discuss this problem with the manager, the GM personally came to my room to inspect the problem. He took us to another room that was 'assured' to not have the same problem. He had insisted that all the rooms had been stayed in by someone from Ritz Carlton to 'smooth out the kinks'. Well the second room - it had orange running water problems too. So off to a third room, but since nothing was ready we had to wait for over an hour before it was made up. The GM did allow us to have access to the Ritz Carlton Lounge for the remaining duration of our time there, however the fact remains that it was a huge disappointment to have to spend the first 3 hours of the hotel sorting an issue like this out..", "The management at the hotel have since confirmed that they spent an extensive amount of time to rectify the problem and worked with me to come up with a satisfactory resolution..", "Like most all other hotels in Bali close to the forest and during the rainy season when mosquitoes are prevalent - they 'fog' the entire property for mosquito control. There was no warning or anything when they did the fogging, and it is something you definitely don't want to be around when they do it. There's a truck that drives around with the fogger on the back and lays down a THICK cloud of anti-mosquito spray that is surely no good for humans to be inhaling. The whole entire property gets fogged daily around 4pm. Be sure to plan your escape to the beach around this time. BE WARNED!", "I have since been informed that they now warn guests upon check-in of their fogging schedule. I assume that this is only seasonal though and not a year round occurrence. Something definitely to keep in mind if you are arriving in Bali during the rainy season.

Room comfort was outstanding, amenities, two wash basins, walk-in closet, huge tv facing the sofa bed, and sexy semi outdoor bathtub! We enjoyed the room so much and didn\u2019t leave on the first day. The next day, we had breakfast like king, breakfast selections were great, pastry, fresh juices, dimsum, fried rice, even soba! Then, happy tummy head to the beach, unwind. We had special sangria mixed by Andrew! Find her, she\u2019ll fix you the best refreshing-alcoholic drinks ;) and entertained by Arif, he does magic tricks, it was all beach-time-fun. Thanks to Ritz and all team, you guys are the best!

Ritz is facing East, try to catch sunrise by the beach if you can.\n", "\nFrom before we arrived until the moment we left, the staff could not have been more attentive, helpful and welcoming. The people are fantastic. The huge construction site next door was so looming and so noisy that it was quite disappointing. It was a real distraction along with the construction still happening at the RC. The spa and gym are located in suites until their final location is finished. My husband had a massage and I had a body treatment --both were excellent. The gym was small but no one was there, so it was fine for us. The gym attendant supplied cold water and towels--a real treat. The Bejana restaurant was beyond fantastic--the chef was attentive to all our requests including a long list of food allergies. He even made a gluten-free cake for my husband's birthday. Over-the-top service! The sommelier at the Beach Grill and the rest of the staff there guided us every step of the way and we had 2 enjoyable meals there. Nyoman, at Breezes, was also very accommodating to our every request. Everyone was trying so hard to make sure we had the best experience possible--they could not have done more in the way of being welcoming and attentive. There is little they can do about the construction, but deep discounts or an upgraded room would have been nice. There were very few people staying during the time we were there. An upgraded room would have gone a long way to ease the impact of the construction. The staff was, at times, overly attentive, but they were trying so hard to make our visit exceptional. Everyone we met wanted us to love Bali as much as they did. We absolutely loved the people and will return to Bali again. Hopefully the Ritz and the monstrosity next door will be finished by then.\n", "\nI found the Ritz Carlton in Nusa Dua to be a beautiful resort. The staff is incredible.

I have been to Bali many times & I would have been devastated if this was my first time coming to Bali & selected the Ritz Carlton. Everyone wants a paradise experience when coming to Bali & instead you are very aware you are right next door to a gigantic construction site. I think it would have been in Ritz Carlton's best interest to notify guests before they confirm their reservation. It looks like it will take over a year for this construction to finish, My suggestion- give major discounts until the resort next door is completed.\n", "\nVery nice villa, with private pool you will enjoy the luxury atmosphere there.

Everything was very good except for a couple of things, I know this is a young hotel but being a Ritz... I thought this things could not happen. The first day we arrived, we just freshened up and made are way to the Japanese inner restaurant Roku, that day their was a wedding going on and when we got to the restaurant they basically received us with a firm \"no service to guest attitude\" because the place was booked as a private venue, the wedding, they didn't even bother to offer a solution, like maybe offer us dinner in a near by lounge table or at the room. After we made are way down to the beach restaurant, food was good, but I think more variety wouldn't hurt. Each day we got a cabana right between the beach and the pool, there we were attended by a person named Juni (sorry if I misspelled the name) she is grateful, a delight to be around, nothing but good old service, attention to details and a happy joyful person, the food at the pool/beach is very good with a good variety, they even went above and beyond to make us a vegetable \"Mexican botana\", with chile powder and all. Our last night we finally got to go to Roku, food was amazing, very good Japanese restaurant and excellent view/atmosphere. The breakfast buffet had an amazing variety but if you get the American breakfast you'll get juice and tea or coffee and milk plus 4 course food, including, fruit variety, bread of almost any kind, cereal and choice of eggs, you safe money from the buffet price and still get a very good, full breakfast. The room was amazing, great view, super spacious, but... They were a few details I did not expected from a chain like Ritz, most of the top of every wall/glass was very dirty, like construction ended no more than a few days before they gave us the room, everyday, at times, a smell from the pipes would spread across the bathroom and room, from the hand washer to the bathtub. When you have the \"do not disturb sign on, they would not disturb you, but when you turned on the \"make up room\" sign, like we did before heading out to the pool for the whole day, they did not make the room in a 6 hour window, we had to call when we arrived from the pool for them to come and do it. Finally the a/c controller did not work well at all, not matter what temperature we put it on, the a/c would just blast freezing, we had to turn it on or off, no other choice, automatic didn't work, nor choosing different temperatures. Over all amazing stay and people at the hotel are great, kind people.\n", "\nWe stayed here for 5 nights as a family with 2 small children... We travel to Bali quite often but we target the hotel as destination as children are not really keen on the sights - they just sleep their way thru. So choosing the right hotel for us means a large suite size room, access to a pool, children's activities and readily available food. The RC Bali had all these in place and since we've stayed in other RC destinations, we had certain expectations. ", "Firstly, it is only recently opened as of late 2014 - so expect to see unfinished building works, immature landscaping. The big problem was facing the massive construction site of another luxury brand hotel, which appeared to shadow the RC - they made sure we stayed on the far side of the property which was quite. We had the ground floor suite with lagoon pool access (upgrade) - that lagoon is shared by 10 neighbors, but it was fun and no loss of privacy. ", "Secondly, the property had low occupancy, which was good - away from the din of crowds. You could walk around the property and see very few guests, even at breakfast. Staff give you much better attention and service, which lived up to the RC brand also.", "The downside was the general drabness of the building architecture - modernistic Balinese if you wish, but it reminded us of the concrete HDB blocks in Singapore, all grey in color - felt quite disappointed. Our suite size was 'adequate' at 85m2 but a larger size would have been preferred but at very great upgrade charge - the room pricing for an incomplete RC property was a big negative and clearly needs some fine tuning to bring guests in to stay. We've enjoyed super upgrades at a few other resort destinations for a modest charge.", "An RC 'signature' is club lounge access - it means quick access to food especially with children, including breakfast. They placed a charge of $160++ which I later realized was excessive and poor value. The general club access charge is usually about $100 from my experience. I discontinued this after 2 days so that we could experience in-room dining and the restaurants. We always saw only 2 or 3 families using the club lounge during our stay.", "The room interior was pleasant and quite - but the glass partitions in the storage/bathroom areas were 'tacky'. I think they will have problems very soon.", "Service standards - simply excellent. Food/breakfast at lounge - average, but the Beach Grill was also excellent. Breakfast at the main restaurant was overwhelming by comparison, and obviously catering to large crowds.", "Ritz Kids was great - our daughters had full attention from staff - not many children present at the time. We justified our stay on the property all 6 days, just lazing and resting and playing with children, watching movies, and never had to leave for sightseeing/shopping. We didn't bother too much with the beach. ", "A great hotel but there's a fair bit of fine-tuning to be done and the property needs to mature. I had a chance to speak to one of the hotel directors and shared much of this with him.\n", "\nI traveled to Bali with two friends as part of a trip to southeast Asia / my bachelor party. My review is from the perspective of a traveler looking to experience the local culture, but who happened to be staying at the Ritz-Carlton. I\u2019ll be as critical as somebody staying at a Ritz-Carlton is suppose to be.", "Getting to the hotel was a bit of a pain. This was mostly because the moment you step outside of the airport you are surrounded by what felt like a thousand locals all fighting to give you a ride. We called a car using Uber, which isn\u2019t entirely popular in Indonesia yet, but still available nonetheless. This was a real disappointment to the wave of drivers pleading for our business, going so far as to hold out their badges to prove their authenticity and following us around the parking lot despite us literally swatting them away. Not a great start to our vacation.", "The \u00fcber ride to the hotel was pleasant and gave us a chance to catch our breath and take in the scenery. We took the highway route (uber doesn\u2019t charge you extra for this, but all of the taxis we took to Kuta / Seminyak charge you the 10k IDR toll to take the highway. Also, the taxis don\u2019t let you know this until they are already on the highway).", "The hotel checkin process was pretty great. The three of us arrived in the lobby around 4pm. We were immediately offered fresh juice and a cold towel and asked two of us to take in the view while the third did the checkin. They walked him down to our room while we watched the ocean from the balcony of the lobby. We didn\u2019t ask for a third bed during checkin, mainly because when we tried to add a third guest online the price was 100$ a day higher and so we were worried that they would tack that amount onto the bill in person, too.", "The room itself was fairly large. It is recessed fairly far back from the ocean and on the 5th floor, so we had an awesome view of the property and the ocean. General notes:", "There weren\u2019t enough outlets for three people to charge two devices each, which was a bit of an annoyance.", "The room is action-packed with amenities like umbrellas, sandals, everything you\u2019d ever need in a bathroom.", "There are two blinds for the floor-to-ceiling windows that are controlled via the switches by one of the beds. They are controlled by separate buttons. One of the buttons simply requires that you press it once and the blind opens or closes automatically. The other requires that you hold down the button for the entirety of the movement of the blinds. This was really annoying.", "The bathroom is the only room that didn\u2019t feel well-polished. Some of the walls seemed quickly put together and dirty.", "They refill all of the water bottles every night and morning. (You can find extra water bottles in the gym, open 24/7)", "The light switches by the bathrooms didn\u2019t make a lot of sense. The switch that turns the bathroom light on also turns on the for the sinks and mirrors, a light that tended to illuminate the entire room and that wasn\u2019t necessary in the night.", "While out on the grounds the first night, we were approached by a Norwegian man named Marcel who introduced himself as the property\u2019s \"executive assistant\u201d. He offered us a ton of advice about the resort and the area, and gave us his card if we needed anything. I got the impression he\u2019s the guy at this resort who could fulfill any request we had, so later we asked him directly for a rollaway bed for the room. Marcel said that wouldn\u2019t be a problem, and sure enough we had a third bed when we got back an hour or so later (no extra charge). Later in our stay, I wanted some more fruit (I devoured the fruit basket in the first two days), and so I asked Marcel when I next saw him if we could have another. Sure enough we had an even fuller basket the next time we went to the room. Pro tip from Marcel: if you\u2019re going to leave the resort for some food, go to Ke Pizza 5 minutes down the road. It was some of the best pizza I\u2019ve ever tasted. We went twice. Marcel seriously made this stay ten times better than it would have been without him.", "This hotel makes certain assumptions about your vacation. Most notably, they don\u2019t expect that you, as a guest of the Ritz-Carlton, have any intention of leaving the resort. You\u2019ll notice this all over: the attendants by the pool by default ask which of the three open restaurants you\u2019ll be dining at tonight, the surprise in the lobby when they see a guest not due to checkout asking for a taxi, the executive assistant, Marcel, suggesting alternatives at the hotel rather than going out for real Indonesian food and experience. The hotel itself is even built in such a way that going back to the lobby is inconvenient, requiring at least a 15 minute journey from our room. I wouldn\u2019t say any of this was a bad thing, but it got to be a little tiring after the first few days.", "The pool is fantastic. When you show up, an attendant runs over to ask where you want to sit / lay. They\u2019ll proceed to makeup the area to your liking and bring you anything else you need. Everything about this was generally overbearing and I could have did myself, but I think that\u2019s what they are going for here. One time I reached up to adjust the umbrella, and an attendant ran over to do it themselves before I could get to it. Every hour or so they bring around some small appetizers or drinks, which were all pretty fantastic.\n", "\nI visited Bali for the first time with my husband and 2 children in mid-April and I'm so happy we chose the Ritz Carlton Nusa Dua!

We were especially impressed by Marcel Damen. The hotel is a serious contender for the best hotel in Bali.\n", "\nSo, like others have said, the hotel is in a soft opening stage. That means the fine dining restaurant isn't open, some hotel wings aren't open, the main spa isn't open (though massages and treatments are available), and there is construction going on throughout the day, on property, and next door at another construction site.

Perfect for our kiddos to swim around while we relaxed on the patio. The beds were perfect, there is a huge walk-in closet, huge bath tub and separate shower. For our family of 4 (2 small children) it's more than enough room. One comment, though it's true of all of Indonesia, is the bath water came out brownish green, so we had to be especially vigilant about our tots not drinking it. Our room was in building 1, which is right next to the Spa being built, but sound blocking seemed to be very good as we didn't hear anything once we closed the windows and doors. I do wish they used normal curtains rather than powered ones as the powered curtains were too loud and slow, and the blackout jammed frequently.

We didn't have any mobile phone service for a couple of days, but during our stay, it seemed the Telkomsel tower turned on, and once it did, calls were very clear and 3G data was decent.", "The main pool is very nice, with lounge areas, cabanas that are free for use (for now), and food service from the tapas bar. We actually had dinner one night in a cabana with our kids and it was outstanding... Peaceful (until my kids got restless) and relaxing.

They would entertain my two boys, by taking them for walks along the beach,driving them around in the golf buggies [my youngest to the kids club] and the eldest ,to either pick up my youngest or to take him to our room because he had forgotten something. They were literally at our beckon call.The chef at Breezes food lunch,who made the most incredible tapas for my husband and I to enjoy lazing away by the pool.The breakfast staff,who would have our lattes at our table the way we like them and make my boys banana smoothies. The breakfast spread was incredible. There is a Japanese sushi area, Indonesian breakfast area, dumplings,Omelette station along with all the standards,fresh waffles and pancakes,Danish pastries,Doughnuts, muffins banana bread,gluten free bread and the usual sliced bread or loaves, fresh juices,cereals, cheese section,cured sliced cold meats,fresh fruit and just incase you want anything they don't have, the staff are only too happy too accommodate.", "We as a family were treated equally the same,if anything my boys lapped up lots of attention and were truly spoilt!", "Yes, we too had one minor incident with our room where the power points in the draw weren't working,but one phone call and maintenance was there.", "The service for the golf buggies was also exceptional!! By the time you hang up your phone, you get a call back saying that the buggy is waiting for you [they have buggies to transport you around the resort as it is easier to get around,given the heat and humidity] though most places like the beach ,pool and restaurants aren't too far if one wanted to walk. The grounds are quite beautifully landscaped.", "Yes, its true that the beach has got seaweed in it [but we saw staff who were raking it every day we were there] its a little rocky as you enter the water but having said that, its very clean[you can see the ocean floor] not too deep so that children can swim in it.", "Nusa Dua is away from it all, but that's why we chose this hotel.You can get across to Kuta or Seminyak using the toll road, which costs around AUD$15.00 and $1.00 for the toll.We didn't experience heavy traffic so it only took us 30min at most either way.", "I'm sure that once the Ritz Carlton is in full swing and all is complete, it would be perfect as it is close to perfect at this point in time.", "Thank you to all and we look forward to coming back in the not too distant future.Our thanks also goes out to all the security staff and Margarete at the front desk who was most pleasant with our stay.\n", "\nProperty is great, rooms are spacious.

We had a room in the #1 building which is right in front of the construction which was annoying if you were trying to sleep in. The staff here are very attentive and are everywhere in case you need any assistance. One particular staff member who was very helpful was Marcel, who gave us his card and said to call him with any request. The rooms are very nice and have a lot of amenities (beach bag, his and her hats, day and night robes, day and night slippers). The resort itself is in the Nusa Dua area which is pretty isolated from most activities on the island. Taxi rides to Seminyak are about 45 minutes (could be worse with heavy traffic). The restaurants on the property are good as to be expected at typical hotel prices (30-50 USD per person without drinks).

A bit iconvenient but that's the same set-up with properties in that location, such as the Nikko next door.", "The reception area was stark and lacking in warmth, as of now. No feeling of luxury at all. The regular reception desk was unmanned at around 9 in the evening when i got there. However, there was a separate enclosed reception office...not sure if it's temporary or a special arrangement for our group.", "Once you look out at the hotel grounds from the reception balcony, the sense of luxury comes to life. Impressive layout. ", "You take the lift to the lower cliff then a buggy takes you to your building. The room was large and well appointed. Being on the ground floor, my room opened to a balcony that had direct access to the pool. It had a comfortable king size bed and firm pillows. It also had a sitting area with complimentary fruits and an assortment of chocolates. Bottled water is plenty and there's a coffee maker.

It does seem a bit cramped, though, especially when it starts to run full.", "Overall service was okay and the staff were friendly. My only run-in was when i asked my room to be made up at around 7am as i was expecting to return by noon and i sort of knew they would run late due to high occupancy. I was told \"certainly\" so i was glad. When I got back at about 12:30, the room was untouched. I called the guest service and once again was told \"certainly\". I know this is part of the Ritz vocabulary but i felt it was a meaningless use of the term. \"Certainly\" is almost a promise but in this case they \"certainly\" failed. so i cautioned the staff that they should say what they mean and make sure they will deliver.", "On the other hand, i requested laundry services to stitch back a button that had come off my trousers and they got it done quickly.", "All in all, it was a good preview to the Ritz but they certainly are not quite up to the luxury standards of ladies and gentlemen...yet.\n", "\nThis is a very new resort. Be aware that construction and finishing are still ongoing. Cleverly it is all done discreetly and very quietly. You would never notice unless you used close observation which in the bright sun of Bali is hard to do!

As a new hotel, the service is excellent! All staff that I encounter are helpful and have good positive attitude. They went all out to have sure your request is fulfill. The rooms are quite standard of ritz but for those with kids you might want to take the lagoon access which connects to 6 rooms with a small lagoon on the ground floor. the pool villa connects to a small lagoon of 3, its very much bigger. But if you need privacy, better take the higher floor. Spa building is not ready yet but they have temporary villa used for spa.

The hotel is not completely finished and they are working out the last details, but this did not take away from our experience. The staff was extremely accommodating and made every effort to satisfy our needs. Everybody from reception, breakfast club, pool& beach team and the golf carts drivers was overly polite and nice. The location is breathtaking and the rooms are spacious and convenient. the balcony doors open completely and one can feel the breeze from the Indian ocean. The view from the lobby is hard to describe in words. We dined at the beach grill and around the pool. Food, drinks and service was excellent. On few occasions we hired a car with a driver from the resort to take us sightseeing. Every time we were happy with the service and professionalism.\n", "\nWe had dinner as a family at the new Ritz Carlton tonight, service was perfect, food super and wine selection great!! The resort is brand new and they really do make best efforts hence there is not much to fault.", "Our only complaint if you can call it that was the table settings, firstly we were given a lovely table in the open air however unfortunately the lighting to all these tables are common so when someone asked for a dark, romantic setting we were all exposed to this, it was so dark we couldn't read the menu. The staff were great and moved us to the only remaining seat indoors. To start with this was great however as the night moved on we found sat next to the open kitchen became just too hot ... To the point I was literally dripping with sweat!", "In summary, great service and food, a few extra sides though wouldn't go a miss ( there are no real veggies on the menu) the only downside is the limited indoor seating and common lighting outdoors.", "That won't stop us returning though next time we come back to Bali, we will return for sure!!\n", "\nThe brand new Ritz-Carlton Nusa Dua is outstanding. The hotel is beautifully laid out and looks over the ocean. On arrival the view from the lobby offers a panoramic 180 degree view. Our suite was stunningly spacious and catered to our family of four exceptionally. The bathroom and the size of the bed are particularly amazing. Down by the pool facing the ocean, we were kindly taken care of by efficient staff that do an amazing job at being there yet not hovering around you. We laid back on a day bed with great music whilst chilled water & snacks are offered complimentary. Everywhere you go the staff know you by name and your preferences. The food is superbly prepared. The private beach in front of the hotel is clean & crystal clear & perfect for swimming. I strongly recommend this hotel for a wonderfully fulfilling luxury escape.\n", "\nThe service exceeded our expectations, even setting the bar at Ritz Carlton standards! The property is not fully open, but they have the kinks out of everything that presently is operating. The food was fantastic; the tempura stuffed zucchini flowers were a particular high note. The menus had a good variety, and everything was prepared with expertise and care. (The Signature lobster roll was the singular disappointment of four our days' selections, with all meals eaten in house.) The rooms are very luxurious, comfortable and quiet, of course. From our room we could see the sea from our balcony. However, had the room itself been arranged thoughtfully, we could have relaxed on the chaise inside and enjoyed the scenery as well. The pool and beach have plenty of lounge seating with good options for both sun and shade, and it is spectacularly gorgeous at high tide. Poolside, canap\u00e9s are passed throughout the day, as are cool towels and water. Sunscreen is freely available as is mosquito repellent. I very much look forward to returning once the landscaping is over its transplant shock, the fixtures are all installed, the construction (quiet as it may be) is complete, and the full resort is open. Meanwhile, enjoy the soft-opening discounts!\n", "\nMy fiancee and I stayed here in Dec, shortly after the property opened. We felt like royalty as we had the property nearly to ourselves. The property is very impressive, especially the views from the lobby. We had a very nice room on the top floor with beautiful ocean views. Service was top notch and all staff was very friendly. I was flattered that after a day everyone we came across knew our name. I loved the trendy golf carts they had to shuttle people around property. Was extremely helpful during the peak heat of the days. We ate at the Beach Grill, where the staff ensured we had an unforgettable meal. Setting was very romantic and we had the best table in the house - essentially right on the beach and tucked away. Food was great. The pool area is quite impressive all around, especially the infinity pool. Be sure to get the fresh coconuts served pool side! Breakfast was quite easily the best complimentary breakfast I have ever had at a hotel. One of the highlights of our stay was the sunrise yoga on the beach. We were celebrating a special occasion and the hotel went out of their way to arrange this for us - something I had dreamed of doing in Bali. When we were departing it felt like we had just visited family. To me that is the ultimate essence of hospitality. Can't wait to come back!\n", "\nI recently stayed at the brand new ritz Carlton in Nusa Dua. It's nice and clean because it's new but the down side is that the spa, gym, and the Indonesian restaurant wasn't open. But there is a temporary spa and gym... The resort is smaller than the other big hotels like Mulia or St.Regis so I could walk around the resort. The rooms are interesting here. The pool villas have a communal pool that is supposed to be shared by three villas and the lagoon access rooms share a pool amongst six or more rooms.. (Can't remember exactly). But anyhow, I recommend staying at the pool villa for its location (center or resort) and if you are lucky like us we had the pool to ourselves. The property was really beautiful and even the beach is not good for swimming, they have this interesting sand that is quite nice. The pool and beach area I some do the best I've seen at Nusa Dua. Staff were all really friendly and very helpful. But during my stay there I did not see the GM which is odd for a resort that new.

The hotel takes pampering to a new level. The services are very personalized and the entire staff is brilliant. Food served in their restaurants is quite good. The chef took special care and made sure we had enough vegetarian(eggless) options specially for breakfast. The couple spa was the best we have taken till date.

I was on my honeymoon with my wife, and decided to book a villa at the Nusa Dua Retreat based on my online search while in our other villa in Seminyak. We wanted to experience other areas of Bali, and unfortunately for me I booked a four night stay and pre-paid. It was non-refundable...Big Mistake!", "I booked the most expensive villa, and the pictures looked great. It showed a nice outdoor area with grass lined pavers and a private pool. When we arrived and were taken to our room, it was not even close to the photos. The view was of an adjoining villa and a rubbish heap off to the left where they leave their construction leftovers. Needless to say, we were not happy. The hotel then put us in a different room, which was OKAY, but then we were listening to the buzzing of a power transformer all day/night. The bathroom also started emitting a rotten stench due to a failure in the plumbing systems. We ONLY STAYED FOR ONE NIGHT!!! After night one, we stayed with a friend on her boat and then completely moved out and went to the Ayodya Hotel in Nusa Dua. The Ayodya was wonderful and ACTUALLY IN NUSA DUA!", "The Nusa Dua Retreat IS NOT IN NUSA DUA!

I can imagine that in earlier days this complex would have been spectacular.", "It is ideal for couples wanting privacy and seclusion for a totally relaxed stay.", "Breakfast is basic but sufficient served in a charming and quaint area, but on our last day we chose to have breakfast in our villa and it was by far the best one we had. The staff even remembered that I like my toast really well browned and that is how they served it every day after I first mentioned it.", "Room service menu is limited but excellent food and very reasonably priced.", "The villas themselves are massive, with a huge pool, there is also a lovely communal pool and a well equipped gym.", "The villa kitchen has a state of the art stovetop....but no untensils supplied for cooking. Considering the villa does not have a lot of nearby restaurants, I feel this might be something they could improve on....that is of course if you feel like cooking whilst on holidays.", "We were approached personally by both the manager and the assistant manager on separate occasions to apologise for our minor issues....this was a lovely touch and demonstrated to us that the staff really do care and address everything. We were made to feel very special.", "I would definitely recommend to couples wanting privacy and space with plenty of comfort.", "Hotel does have free wifi...but it is not consistent so advice would be, buy some data for phone or iPad if you need to stay connected on holidays.", "Will definitely be returning to Nusa Dua Retreat.\n", "\nGot a great deal online and stayed a week in a double story villa with our own pool.

Thanks to all the friendly and helpful staff. We will be back soon with our friends and family next year :)\n", "\nWe had a great time here, very friendly staff, with pretty good facilities. It was well away from anywhere else, and allowed for some good relaxing times away from the hustle and bustle. The private plunge pool and rooftop terrace were great, with really luxurious rooms. The food was also really good, and at our time, the place wasn't too busy, so we had free reign over the whole place. The only draw backs, on the other side of the coin, were that it was quite far from other areas of Bali and a little isolated (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Allow half an hour to an hour of travel time between hot spots. There is a developing beach region, Pandawa Beach, which is very close to the hotel, and only a few minutes drive. There are limited to no hecklers here, and you can relax without being hassled. The only other thing is that Wifi is only accessible from the reception/bar area and the restaurant regions of the hotel and not from private rooms. I would whole heartedly recommend staying here, especially for a couples get away for an affordable price and great facilities, without the crazy people who stay in Kuta.\n", "\nI pulled the trigger for a \"hot rate\" hotel on hotwire and landed a great deal for this villa. It's about a 40 minute drive to the airport. 30 minutes from downtown Kuta, 20 minutes from Uluwata temple, and 5 minutes from Pandawa Beach. In other words, it's in a fairly secluded area. ", "IT's the perfect resort if you're getting away from a loud city and want quiet and clear skies that are perfect for star gazing. ", "I've been in resorts and 5 star hotels all over the world, but my wife and I were absolutely blown away with the room's own private and lavish swimming pool and rooftop. We easily had over 1000sq ft for ourselves. The room was fitted with three large screen TV's, a huge bath tub, ornate curtains, lively art, and a full kitchen. The \"room\" easily topped suites I've used in with the Mandarin, Bellagio, and even Trump hotels. The full glass walls that lined the interior of the decor only added to the luxury of our private villa. ", "We were also pleased with the Cable TV that included HBO and a large colleciton of DVD's you can borrow from free from the concierge. ", "While it's located a 5 minute drive, or 20 minute walk from the beach, there was a wonderful cooling sea breeze that also kept the bugs away. You may want to bring a light sweater as it was a bit chilly in the evenings. ", "There were a few drawbacks. While we loved the setting, it is quite remote. That was perfect for us, as this part of the trip was meant to be more of a retreat. While the hotel does provide shuttles to a Bali Collection, Discovery Mall, and the beach, we found it a bit easier to get around by renting a scooter. The hotel provided us with a scooter rental, but doubled the rental price for the convenience of having it delivered to us. I do wish they had a later shuttle to go to Kuta. Word of advise, while you can pay to hire the hotel's services for rides, I'd recommend ordering a taxi since it's half the price (10-15 minute wait, so call ahead). As for getting back to the hotel, be sure to take the card and insist on the driver calling for directions.", "While you have access to a kitchen and grilll, don't expect to have pots and pans or charcaol provided. Good luck finding a grocery story in case you do want to cook your own meals. The price for a rooftop grill provided by the staff was $50 (USD) a person, which we passed on.", "While we did enjoy the complimentary internet provided by the lobby, conveniently located right next to villa 120 (our room), the drinks and food we ordered there were not upto par. While not ridiculously over priced ($8 mixed drinks, reasonably priced pasta), none of our drinks were made correctly and the food was absolutely passable. The free buffet breakfast was decent, but not something we looked forward to. I'd suggest checking out the chinese seafood restaurant located on the way to the beach for your regular meals. The cappuccino was nice. Just be sure to order it early in the day while they have good deals running from 11am-5pm, including very cheap beer. That being said, the hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful. That can be said of most of Bali, where the people treat visitors as though we were their guests.", "Also, the gym was a bit lackluster. You're probably not going to get a good workout in. While we did not try out the spa, the center did looks quite beautiful.", "If the restaurant could provide tasty drinks and food, this place would be perfect. However, the ornate villa , the serene location, along with the amazing atmosphere in Bali...this was the perfect getaway! It was more like a mountain retreat, nestled right next to the beach. ", "Very relaxing and highly recommended! Also, for day trips, do consider the evening sunset over by the Uluwata Temples. The beach located to the resort is beautiful, but a bit loaded with trash and the sand isn't very comfortable. Head to the end of the shop stalls for a more secluded area and softer sand.\n", "\nGreat place off a relaxing holiday. Food choices for a Coeliac were brilliant thanks to Chief Ian and head of food Dermot. Spa is worth the visit via a luxury package. Rooms are very good and quiet. Close to all the Nusa Dua holiday treats. Staff are all very competent and helpful\n", "\nSo for starters The Nusa Dua retreat and spa is not as the name suggests in Nusa Dua, this was a disappointing start to my honeymoon.", "After coming into our villa we were a bit overwhelmed by the spaciousness of it all and the huge private pool. We soon however became overwhelmed by the smell of cigarette smoke in our non smoking room. ", "A positive would be the nice kitchen in the villa equipped with fridge, stovetop and microwave however that flows straight on to a negative, all these great cooking facilities, no pots, pans, microwave safe containers, utensils or plates to be found in any of the cupboards, there wasn't even a kettle or coffee mugs for us to make use of the complimentary tea and coffee facilities! ", "There was a great upstairs area where we could relax in private but agin this was let down by no cushions on the day beds because they were apparently out for repair...", "We decided to check out after one night.", "In closing, the fresh cooked ommelette at breakfast was very nice but the buffet was cold, the staff were very nice, the private pool was fantastic and the bed was comfy, there's no way I'd come back here though unless I got very lost! TIDAK BAGUS!!!!!\n", "\nAbsolutely fantastic rooms, not cheap but very well worth the money, very impressive although the site does have somewhat of 'compound' feel to it stuck in the middle of nowhere. A few minor details let the place down. First of all the pool always has leaves in it, it would take 2 minutes to clean? There are no padded mats on the sunloungers??! This is purely ridiculous and I imagine easily rectify able?? If the guys who rent loungers at the beach can source them I'm sure the manager of the complex could? There is no seating at all by your own private pool??! This is simply not good enough. The staff are fantastic, very friendly and helpful, the free shuttles to the surrounding areas is a very nice touch.\n", "\nWe booked this retreat based on pictures and information from the retreats website and also expedia's website - sad to say, this retreat was NOT what was advertised. Totally disappointed and ended up leaving 5 days early and moved to another hotel with better amenities!! ", "resort was dated and didn't look like the pictures on the website. we moved villas from a very dated and dirty villa to a more updated one on arrival. there were no basic amenities like a jug or cooking pots etc (despite a large kitchen that couldn't be used!). no rubbish bins (didn't help with the ants), roof top had no sunbeds or padded seats as shown in pics - just a wooden deck. the restaurant was Awful at best. We refused to eat here after the first night which meant we had to travel 20mins to get food at night. bfs was ok - although mainly aimed at the Asian customer.", "positives - large villa and great private pool but that is it.", "would not recommend & based on the fact we left 5 days early due to the misleading information on the website - would not return here.\n", "\nYes as othereviewers have mentioned the place is far from the airport in a rather deserted area but as the name suggest its a great place for a retreat far from the hustle and bustle. ", "The condors are wow. Very spacious and clean, own living room kitchen open air bed on the second floor with lounge , two floors all to yourself and....own private swimming pool. I loved this place , I was there on business but I would highly recommend it for honeymoon or for a nice relaxing holiday. The decor is lovely and modern. everywhere was beautiful. If you love tv you will love it here there is a tv everywhere even in the large bathroom . Use the spa its nice.Beach is near and there is a bus to go there.

Yet again after staying a week in Tuban it was nice to retreat to a quiet sanctuary.", "We were offered a free upgrade and chose a deluxe room which was brilliant. It was away from the main part of the hotel but not a problem. We were greeted warmly and shown very professional service in our check in.", "While it is classed as Nusa Dua , yes it is 15 minutes from the Nusa Dua compound with all of the 5 star hotels, but this is offset by being quiet and remote,set in a rural area that is why it is called a retreat!", "Pandawa Beach is within walking distance or accessible with the free shuttle to and from the beach. I find it very relaxing walking to the beach as it is down hill from the retreat but coming back, unless you are really fit would find it hard going on the return.", "The staff are really helpful, some of their English is not too good, but the only way that it is going to get better is if they practice with the guests and really it is not that hard to get across what you are wanting. We also heard them speaking to other Asian guests in their native tongue.", "We found this gem of a place on a Scoopon deal last year and did not know if we were going to be disappointed,but it is where we will book when returning to Bali.", "If you are wanting a 5 star, non personal, faultless experience this is not the place for you.....but if you are wanting an escape from the main stream Bali, really relax in a great clean villa, kind and friendly staff and do not mind having to use a shuttle service to get to the main hub this is for you!", "All I can say is that people have different expectations of what they want their stay to be like and to what standards, I myself am quite fussy and LOVE LOVE LOVE it here!\n", "\nI booked this place on Hotwire, so I had totally no idea what hotel I was getting until I paid. It says 4.5 stars in the Nusa Dua area, and it was NOT good.", "We landed at 10pm, and the location of the hotel is in the middle of nowhere. It's nowhere close to the other resorts in Nusa Dua (think St. Regis, Bale, etc). It's literally a 40 min drive from the airport with no traffic. There is no beach front, you can forget it as it's in the middle of a field.", "Anyway, we were very hungry after landing, having not eaten on the flight at all. We checked in at 11pm and called the front desk for room service. They were CLOSED. How can you not have 24 hour room service and call yourself a 4 star resort? ", "We looked into the fridge, there was nothing. There is a small menu and price list for \"nuts\", but there were no nuts to be found, or soft drinks, anything. The whole room is really dark, so you can't really focus on how crappy the place is. The chandelier on top of the bed has 2 legs about to fall off, the wall has cracks and the travertine floors are not sealed properly. The air conditioning is a fail.", "We read other people's reviews about the green pools (unhygenic), so we never bothered to jump into the pool at night since nothing could be seen.", "Since we checked in at 10pm, I asked for a late check out. Perhaps 1pm or 2pm so I could sleep in? NO. It wasn't available. They advised me to leave my luggage at the front desk and use the facilities on their miserable resort as there was someone checking in right after me. Seriously? Into my villa when there are so many other villas available? ", "Last but not least, the toothpaste was unsealed. The cap of the toothpaste has a sharp edge to poke into the tube, but no poking was necessary.. I hope they do not reuse their toothpaste.

There is some gimmick going on.", "The hotel villa was very big, it seems like the kind of place that college people would crash in. Avoid.\n", "\nRead reviews about the inaccessibility of this resort and we were pretty worried about finding our way there. Though the resort offers Airport Transfer upon arrival, they charge US$15nett/car/way.", "We decided to make use of the free hotel transfer of Rumah Spa (landed at airport, proceeded to spa for our treatment, after treatment they transferred us to Nusa Dua Retreat and Spa).", "We arrived round 6ish in the evening and it was a long drive in to where the resort was situated (all we could see was darkness & bushes), even the spa driver got lost for abit. True to what reviews said. There were no amenities or restaurant or minimarts whatsoever around the restaurant because the resort is in the middle of no where.", "Check-in was a breeze and the staff are all courteous and friendly, fantastic service. Buggy drove us to where our villa was, room number 126. Once the staff opened the villa's sliding door, the interior of the villa just blew us away! Very spacious and lovely interior!", "Resort offers free transfer to Padawa beach (drop off & pick up), Bali collection (drop off & pick up) as well as Discovery Mall Kuta (drop off only).

Booked directly with the resort for the honeymoon package - the airport transfers, daily breakfast, 1 candle light dinner, and 1 lunch, 2 x 2 hr massage included.", "First impression of the resort was good as the driver was already holding a BIG placard when we exited the customs so that was really reassuring. The service staff was excellent during our stay though sometimes we had some communication issues due to language.", "Getting around the resort is relatively easy. There is always buggy service, but if you are in your villa, you need to call reception to check its availability. We stayed in the Grand Deluxe villa which was located in the next block/building. To get there, you need to either get the buggy to drive there, or just walk there on foot from the main entrance. I would say as you will be walking along a road with vehicles coming both ways, this might not be so safe if you are vacationing with your kids.", "The villa itself needs some fixing, there were cracks everywhere (tho I don't think you can see them in my pics). We were shown a 'working kitchen' and that 'you can cook if you so wish', but there were not pots or pan to cook with. In the drawer, only a couple of spoons and 1 precious fork. No kettle to boil water though i improvised with the coffee maker. Btw, there was no coffee powder to brew any coffee either. Only instant coffee and some tea bags. A fruit bowl was a nice touch.", "The private pool is nice tho the water sprouts on the wall were not working. Do note that if you have other guests staying next to you, they might see your private pool if they walked to the edge of the upper deck :P I knew coz thats how I found out how green the pool next to ours was.", "Do note that while the bathroom was huge, the toilet bowl was located just beside the door next to the pool, there was not privacy shield except a low wall. This might be a problem if you are with friends. One can see your legs sticking out when standing in the living room. Also, you cannot have total privacy when you are in the bathroom as the huge doors are only partially covered with curtains.", "Bedsheets had a smell, can't put a finger on it.. but definitely not FRESH LAUNDRY smell. We were there when housekeeping came and I saw there was a HUGE stain on the mattress when they lifted the bedsheets.. YUCK. I didn't want to know what KIND of stain that was.", "Our villa was amongst a row of villas in the next block from the main building. Between these rows of villas and the main building (where the main recept, other facilities are), there was a gap where some motorbikes were parked on a dirt road. My bf said it would not be difficult to climb up those walls and get into the villas.. that freaked me out a little considering one could climb up the walls on the outside to the upper floors, come down the stairs, and enter the villa (no lock on the door which separates the bathroom and the pool/ stairs to the upper floor)", "In general, facilities in the resort are old, the fabric on billiard table torn. Wifi was not detectable in our villa, the only stable connection we could get wifi was at the restaurant we had our daily breakfasts. Wifi at the main reception was intermittently on and off. Ooooh the suspense..", "The food in the resort was really nothing to shout home about... breakfast was ok, the free lunch was tough satay with hard rice and crackers past their expiry date. We went to the pure bar just a floor up from the main reception and it took them an hour to serve us food. They later told us the reason was because food was prepared in another place so we had to wait longer. So guys, better ask where lunch was served to minimize your hunger pangs.", "The candle light dinner was held at our villa and it was better, barrumundi was nice, couldn't remember the other dish so I guess that wasn't as delicious :P dessert was my favourite, think it was some mousse with jelly which we chilled in the freezer. The dinning room was set up really nice with a candle except it was not lit :S They also had 2 guys come lit up our pool with candles (but not the candle on our table lol) and draw the curtains for the night. The 2nd night the guys came to draw the curtains but no candles. My bf had to ask for them :S You should too if you want to swim in the pool later.", "You need transport as the resort was not close to anywhere. There were free shuttle service which you could made use of but sometimes you have to wait for the next timing as each vehicle is only up to 6 guests max. One time we were told might be a problem when there were suppose to be a drop off to the airport at the time of the shuttle. I find it strange because there were obviously 2 more vehicles parked in the compound. ", "Anyway, we checked out the nearby beach (the driver took us to pandawa beach?) and the water was not very clean. The beach near the bali collection was much much better. Bali collection is a factory outlet/shopping area which we felt was overrated as well. Discovery mall in Kuta was much better.", "All in all, the resort did not warrant the price we paid for. But the service staff was always so courteous and helpful which somewhat made up for it. Visit only IF there is a BIG discount.\n", "\nWe stayed here for 3 days which included being here over the bali festival of silence day which falls on 12th march.", "We were warmly greeted when we arrived and our first impressions were good. We were taken to our villa with our luggage with a golf buggy and given a brief tour of the grounds on the way.", "The grounds were not as ud expect for a retreat nothing really special about them the odd flower and bit of greenery with very cobbled streets (no good for pushchairs or wheelchairs).", "Our villa - was lovely, kitchen area, lounge, bedroom and bathroom. Bathroom complete with extra shower and bath. Tv above the bath a nice touch but not necessary for a 4 star rated place. Besides no joke the bath took atkeast an hour to run to a decent level and the water that came out the taps for the bath, sinks and shower never ran hot only luke warm :(", "Pool was lovely and a real bonus only downside nowhere to I bathe or put a chair by pool there is a sun terrace on top but up quite a few steps. Up on the sun terrace is two sun lounges and a little seating area - the furniture up there though is discussing, particularly the seating area - all dirty you wouldn't want so up there. Also net curtains were filthy. Curtains in rooms are difficult to shut and don't keep light out so each morning we were woken when sun rised, better thicker curtains needed, especially in bedroom.", "Bedroom lovely and DVD player in bedroom an lounge. You can borrow DVDs free to watch although 2 out of the 3 DVDs (sky fall and click) we chose to watch didn't work and stopped half way through films - very annoying!", "Staff were always so helpful.", "Because it was low season we went for dinner at the restaurant on first night and were only people there. Soup and garlic bread was good a was my boyfriends chicken, my barramundi - fish of the day was not good though! You had to cut the fish like it was meat :( also drinks were double price in the restaurant. Compared to the pure bar, even though the drinks are made at the pure bar and just brought over.", "To be honest the food and as we call the food saga was a bit of a nightmare on our 2nd day the menu changed to just 2 pages consisting of a couple salads, some sandwiches and 3 main courses; 2 were chicken, 1 beef. We appreciate the reduced menu was inflight of the festival but it was too reduced if you ask me. The 2nd night our meals were wrong we were offered free juice though.", "The 3rd day silence day we were served dinner in our villa. Initially we were told this was free and selected off a menu then was told it wasn't an had choose of another (the 2 page menu) so chicken again!!! All this hassle on day 3 meant we were constantly interrupted all afternoon and couldn't relax on silence day. We were offered apologise and 2 free cokes.", "Complimentary tea and cake available every Afternoon this was good. ", "As for breakfast an utter disappointment. Food very limited to toast, vegetables, noodles and a bit of egg. No variety at all, totally not acceptable for 4 stars. On day 3 at breakfast there was 4 staff and 4 sets couple inc us I had to ask for cutlery, tea, water an Ben a plate as they'd run out etc. these things that should been catered for. also on this day even by 8.30 when we came to breakfast little food was left.", "No option for breakfast in villa and room service menu very limited", "Spa was ok we had a complimentary 15 min massage which want too enjoyable - quite rough and wasn't asked how pressure was so just endured it as only 15 mins was done in I comfy chairs fully clothed.", "Criminal pool looked nice though didn't use a had villa pool.", "Free gutles to Bali collection and beach are well worth taking. Beach is lovely :)", "Pool table very worn; cues don't work and table all split again not 4 star.", "Generally not in the slightest 4 stars but an ok place today. Nothing near by so you have to eat at the hotel\n", "\nWe had a stunning townhouse villa and it was magic. ", "All round this was such a great choice. You're hidden away from everything and everyone. It's a but of a trek to get there and don't try to remember the route as you WILL get lost. We weren't sure if we were being stolen and taken to ransom when we arrived at night but on arrival and the next morning were loving every second.

You will live this one as long as you can handle the distance to Seminyak and aren't in a rush!\n", "\nFour of us enjoyed several days here and found it to be a very relaxing enjoyable retreat. The butler introduced himself as we walked into the room and indicated he would be available to get us whatever anytime day or night. Our balcony was perfect as was the pool and we seemed to be the only people enjoying the pool in off season of late January. The food was excellent with a great choice on the menu and buffet breakfast. I wouldl not hesitate to recommend this to anyone. It also appeared to be very child friendly...family oriented..\n", "\nMy partner and I stayed here for 2 nights just to get away from the city and it was probably the best thing we did throughout our whole trip! From the time we exited the taxi to being escorted to our room-staff couldn't be more accommodating! The villa was unbelievably amazing! The lounge and combined dining is huge and the bedroom is fantastic overlooking our own private pool which was very clean. The bathroom is fit for a king and larger than the bedroom itself. The rooftop area was beautiful and peaceful - ideal for relaxing. The staff are amazing and tended to our every need. They organised a fantastic dinner in the villa and even gave us a discount. You get GREAT value for money staying here. The only downfall is that it is not situated near the beach but they are willing to take you free of charge at scheduled times which is fine. We will be staying here again!\n", "\nI went their last year with my friend. We had one of the best experiences in his hotel. The rooms are huge with exquisite interiors. From the bed to the curtains everything was perfect. Private pool a d a terrace with barbecue facilties added up to the charm. I highly recommend this hotel!\n", "\nWe were here for 7 days. What an experience!! Very good but with lots of problems. Wonderful villa, spacious, comfortable, excellent pool (sometimes) and very attentive staff. Problems, well, we changed villa once because the pool turned green. On arrival there was no gas connected for the kitchen, or plates, pans or utensils. And look closely and lots of small problems with tired sun beds, ripped sun bed covers and not too clean areas on the roof spaces. Oh, and one of the reasons for booking here was their fitness centre - which was closed for refurbishment!!", "But the staff were first class, the reception, restaurant and driving staff could not have been better, really attentive and helpful. And one hidden gem - the secret beach, just a five minute ride down the hill, or a 20 minute walk if you can manage the hill coming back. ", "An unusual experience, and I would return in the future.\n", "\nThe Nusa Dua Retreat and Spa is absolutely fantastic.The service is top class. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Eating in is very reasonably priced. The location was great with free shuttles to and from the beach. There is a shuttle to and from Kuta and the Retreat is an ideal place to retreat to away from the noise and chaos of Kuta. We were picked up from the airport and also taken back. I would highly recommend the Nusa Dua Retreat and Spa and plan on going back again next year. It was truly a magical experience.", "Colleen - Perth Western Australia\n", "\nI bought a deal on Groupon. I bought a separate flight. I tried to confirm and reconfirm with the hotel staff my reservation, and i left to Bali.

This is a perfect getaway for you. We got the villa from the groupon deal. I must admit that the experience with Villa Indonesia is crap. They are totally not professional, slow in their reply, each and every staffs promise different things to you when they cannot even be sure they can deliver that. But I am glad, everything turn out well & we manage to get the date we wanted for the vacation. The villa is an hour drive from Kuta, no restaurant nearby. But there is a bus shuttle provided to the nearest shopping mall at fixed timing everyday. ", "The staff is very helpful at the reception to arrange for our driver for the 1-day tour, especially when the person-in-charge (Villa Indonesia personnel) is not contactable at all. Buggy is provided to send us to our villa. Villa wise, we got the one without the sun roof. There are 3 types of villa, FYI. The villa is huge. Pool is rather clean and there is a water dispenser in the villa itself. There is nothing to fault about the villa. Rental of DVDs is available at the reception. ", "We arranged for our dinner & breakfast to be served in our villa. The staff arrived on the dot at the timing we arranged earlier at the reception. This is unlike the other villas we visited when we need to call at least twice before our food arrived. ", "All-in-all, it has been a pleasant stay at the Villa.\n", "\nAfter reading the reviews on tripadvisor we were really expecting the worst for our stay here. Upon arrival though we were pleasantly suprised with the property. While we were disappointed that we didn't get an upstairs pool area, the villas were huge, and generally well maintained. Our villa was clean however in need of some general maintenance, and the pool while not spotless as you would expect for a 5 star resort, was clean enough to swim in. We didn't put our heads under though. The breakfast was ok, but again not what you would expect for a 5 star resort, and by the 5th day you are well and truly over the selection on offer. The included dinner was also average, and the one day tour was again not what we expected. We got a driver who didn't speak english and so a tour guide accompanied us. It wasn't the day we had planned but more of a tour of the island, taking us to the typical touristy areas, and places where they received commission. They were also running over half an hour late and we were told we needed to be back by 6pm despite starting at 10. The shuttle buses were good however the bus into Kuta could be improved as there are only 2, one at 9.30am and another at 2pm with no pick-up. There is also a limit to the number of people that can fit in the shuttle (7) so if it fills up, you'll have to find your own way as they don't offer a second shuttle. Cabs were however easy to get and once we had learned our way back it was easy to explain to the cab drivers, as well as showing them the map on the back of the business card. The beach down the road is also nothing to write home about. ", "The 2 hour spa package was AMAZING, one of the best massages we have ever had. The beds in the room were also super comfy!", "If you are after a quiet place to stay, then this place is ok, but very far from everything, and not the 5 star resort it claims to be. I would say more of a 3.5 star.\n", "\nAfter having read some of the mixed reviews, I must say that I checked in fully prepared to leave and go the Courtyard by Marriott in Nusa Dua if some of the reviews proved to materialise - but I must say that we were very pleasantly surprised. We stayed 24th March for 4 nights. The Retreat is located about 15 minutes from Nusa Dua, literally in the middle of nowhere, but hey...I'm sure that's what a RETREAT is all about. They have a free shuttle service to Nusa Dua and Kuta if the times suit you, but cabs are but a phone call away and a taxi is only about $4 on the meter into Nusa Dua anytime you like. Just allow 15 minutes for them to arrive.", "We were using a 4 night 'Spreets' deal from the net and the check in was reasonable quick & easy and we were duly whisked away to our Villa (No. 115) in a golf buggy. Our first impression of the Villa was ...............WOW! We had a full Kitchen and were told we could cook our own meals if we liked (yeah right...I'm on holidays!), a dining table, living room with big screen TV and DVD, a beautiful bedroom with a King bed and it was decorated with a love heart marked out in petals on the bedspread. The bedroom of course had a big screen TV as well. The Ensuite was huge, complete with a rainhead shower and big tiled bath. Over the bath was another big TV making 3 in total. Marble floors throughout looked beautiful. The Villa is designed around your own private pool, and I mean pool....not just a small plunge type. Upstairs we had our own rooftop deck - huge, with day bed, outdoor setting, sunlounges and a BBQ. The staff were wonderful, the spa was great and the restuarant was more than acceptable although breakfast was a little unusual in that you have to fill out a form with the supplied pencil and tick off what you wanted to order - bit like filling in the meal form on an airline. You had the impression that you had the place all to your self, as we probably only saw half a dozen other guests during our stay. We had breakfast on our own a couple of times in the restuarant and whilst we only had dinner there one night, there was only one other couple in the restuarant. I don't know what their occupancy rate was? The bar above Reception was deserted each time I went by.", "OK, sounds great so far, so where is the poor execution you ask?", "The complex has an unusal paving system laid around it which consisted of hollow concrete pavers filled with soil and grass grown on top. Many of these are not filled properly and walking around the place was difficult for someone with smaller feet (like the wife) and she was constantly scared of spraining an ankle as she slipped into the holes. Our Villas construction could only be descibed as poor - the front glass panel next to the front door had a huge crack in it, the ceilings had numerous water stains obviously from the deck above leaking, the Kitchen we were to cook in, had no pots / pans / utensils whatsoever - in fact there was no gas connection to the cooktop at all - the hose was just laying in the cupboard. There is water penetration in the walls of the Kitchen with bubbling in the wall, the Kitchen cupboard doors don't line up (not even close), there is an electrical cable tacked along the skirting in the kitchen and it goes under the drawers with no conduit protection at all - only a matter of time before someone gets electrocuted. The kitchen sink is not clipped in - it just sits in the hole, held in place by the tap. The vanity unit in the bathroom was so low, that I brushed my teeth whilst on my knees. The pool has three little waterfall features, one of which had fallen off and the other two didn't work. The pool filter ran 24/7 and was sucking air and blowing it into the pool making a noise. The rooftop deck has loose and cracked tiles all over the place. The resort is promoted as new, staff say maybe 2 years, but the overall impression you get looking at the exterior, is that it is 10 years old, and that it is in need of repainting. If you touch an external wall with your hand, the white paint comes off on your hand - bit like leaning on a blackboard with chalk all over it. The breakfast ordering system is unusual, the gym doesn't open till 9am and a Bintang beer costs an astounding 50,000Rp - double the cost of any restuarant in Nusa Dua or any other bar / resort that I have stayed in in Bali - and I've been in a few!", "So they are the facts. ", "Would I stay there again? Well, if I had a Spreets deal again...............absolutely, it was great value for the money - but if I had to stay there at full rate, I seriouly doubt it. The Westin or Marriott to my way of thinking would represent far better value.\n", "\nSeems that I'm not the only couple who have encountered the voucher/offer problem. Villas Indonesia is currently out-of-business and a warning to whoever that had booked accomodation with them through a 3rd party agent/company, please confirm with Nusa Dua whether your stay has been confirmed and sort out with your 3rd party owner.", "Arrived at the Villa late evening and I gotta say that the Villa wasn't in the heart of shopping areas as the location was outskirt of Nusa Dua; it was our plan to stay in a quiet and comfortable lodging in the first place and we've gotten what we want. Part of my package comes with a chauffeur that drives us around for 1 day; what else can we ask for?", "Being first time in Bali, was feeling quite assured (you heard so much about terrorist acitivities) that they have a 24 hours security team (control centre is at the gate) guarding the Villa, and screening through our cars when we arrived.", "Clean, elegant lobby with the receptionist greeted us warmly and we were check-in to the Villa in no-time. Was ferried to our Villa on a golf cart by a friendly staff and he walked us round our Villa.", "Was quite amazed by the size and cleaniness of the Villa. It was huge and it comes with a well-lighted pool which sets up the atmosphere of the Villa. The sun deck was lovely as it provides a wonderful night view of the sky with us lying comfortably on the sun-tan benches & mini-pavilion bed.", "Overall stay was really good and it's seriously a good retreat for us. We are glad that Mr Henry and his team were really friendly and helpful. It would have been perfect if the Internet is up and running.", "Final tip to potential Bali travelers: Google Nyepi aka Silent Day before confirming your stay. We were confined within our Villa for 1 whole day due to this event. Disappointed - Yes, but it's a life-time experience to see ogoh-ogoh across the whole of Bali.\n", "\nWe had some troubles with another booking agent but nonetheless the staff was very accommodating and made our travels that much more enjoyable. The location is further off the busy streets. If you don't like the bustling of cars honking and bikes zooming pass, you would enjoy this place. Its near Pandewa beach and a real welcoming retreat. The villas are beautiful. Its really big and spacious and has a nice private pool and sun deck to enjoy. Its like staying in a big house/ a holiday home. Food is nice and staff are ready to help. Me and my wife welcome the greens around. The spa was also really relaxing and a nice treat to a tiring day.", "Jimmy really helped us out. Thanks!\n", "\nAs with all the previous voucher user reveiws, we had our hicups. However, the manager, Mr Henry, could not have done any more to help overcome them and compensate with apologies. Villas International are the villans and hopefully for the Retreat they will be able to sort this out before too much longer. If you booked through Why Pay Full Price make sure you have their voucher with you.", "O.K Back to the Retreat. Wow! Huge apartments. Can't overestimate the importance of their provision of filtered water in the villa, as much as you can drink, and you'll need it if it is humid. The private pool is wonderful and so refreshing after a day of sight seeing. The Retreat provides a great shuttle service. It felt like the real Bali being amongst the jungle like vegetation. The staff are sooooo friendly, and, yes there are some communication issues, but, be patient, because all they want to do is provide whatever you want when you want it and with a great big smile. The service is top class. The breakfast provides a wide variety of options, let's face it if you are at home you don't have this much variety. We would recommend a driver, actually, we would recommend our driver, Harry, he speaks very good English and wants to learn more. He is extremely friendly, happy, an excellent driver. We travelled most days with him and felt completely safe and secure. His local knowledge was invaluable to us as first timers to Bali. Feel free to contact me for his details.", "The spa at the resort was excellent. don't miss it! The Pure Bar was such a relaxing place to unwind and have a drink. We found the food at the Splash Bar very good and for what we got it was very reasonable. There are places to eat where you can get cheap food in Bali, but not with the convenience and class of the Retreat. I think you get what you pay for. If you want to star in classy accommodation, even in Bali, expect to pay a bit more for food. We thought it was worth it. My husband and I do enjoy eating out when on holidays and we found our experience at the Nusa Dua Retreat was value for money. A word of warning- don't stay here if you want a night life close by. We were able to have a great time staying here while enjoying the calm, quiet and real surroundings and, also, venture out and discover more of Bali.\n", "\nThere are lots of reviews about this retreat and I agree with most of them so won't keep bangin on about the same issues. We used a voucher purchased through Ouffer and stayed 8 nights in total.", "Yes, no one turned up to pick us up at the airport - after waiting for an hour for Rucky, we got a taxi. Yes, Villas Indonesia are totally useless and did not send the payment for our booking through to the retreat. Yes, we also had to pay for the first night. Yes, the restaurant food is ordinary. Yes, the retreat is near nothing. But ...", "It's very private and quiet (except for the constant Gamelan!). We had no trouble getting a taxi to come to us but be aware that not many of the drivers around the island had any clue where the retreat is. It's not actually in Nusa Dua but a snall village called Kutuh. The Villa (we were upgraded to a Grand Villa) was enormously large with a huge pavillion top deck. The AC was wonderfully efficient. The staff were all very nice - very friendly and well meaning but with some language problems. The breakfasts each day which were included, were fine although on the eighth day, we were getting a bit tired of them. The spa IS wonderful - had the best facial ever. Well worth it. The dinner menu in the restaurant is expensive by Balinese standards and quite poor.", "Despite this, we had many issues with our stay. Apart from the check-in debarcle, Villa 223 didn't have hot water for two days so we were eventually moved to 201 (somewhat better). The hotel wi-fi worked for 2 days then not for the next 6. Annoying especially given we visited on the Silent Day (Bali NY) which meant we were locked (literally) into the retreat complex for 24 hours.", "We arranged a driver for 5 of the 8 days we were there so never really had issues with the remote location. It would have been nice to walk from the villa to a local bar or restaurant though.", "Given all these issues, the price we paid was very good and we viewed all the issues we encoutered as part of the Bali adventure. One the day we checked out, the retreat confirmed that Ouffer had honoured the original voucher and that the additional funds we paid would be refunded.", "I'd recommend it with a voucher only, but be prepared for some dramas!\n", "\nOur villa was ENORMOUS - luxuriously spacious and well appointed. We loved the private pool and huge covered sun deck complete with a beautiful four poster bed with mozzie net. We had our breakfast delivered up there daily, very decadent. Probably the most outstanding feature though is the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Henry and his team are superb, as was Putu the girl who checked us in and helped us deal with the dramas of Villas Indonesia not honouring our WhyPayFullPrice voucher. That side of things turned out happily - we did have to pay again but Henry arranged our refund in good faith when he got the clearance from WhyPayFullPrice. ", "Yes Nusa Dua is around fifteen minutes away but taxis are plentiful and cheap ($5 or less) and the drivers badly need the work - so we suggest that you use them and tip generously, it can make a huge difference in their lives. The hotel also has a good free shuttle. We also suggest that you venture further than the Bali Collection - if you continue through to the beach and turn either left or right there are wonderful beach side hotels with fabulous facilities for dining, cocktails etc. We spent much of our time at the superb Laguna - yummy food right on the beach. ", "The pluses of the Retreat are that's it's quiet, secluded and luxurious with wonderful warm smiling helpful staff. The rooms do vary though - ours was right at the end, was 100% private upstairs and down, and had a lovely view over the countryside. Don't think we'd have enjoyed it anywhere near as much if we were viewless or overlooked by other apartments. Sure it's tucked away from things but it's very easy to get out and about when you want to. The spa is wonderful too.", "The minuses include a very limited menu - would be good to see a broader selection with daily specials. And the gamelon music in the dining area gets very repetitive very quickly.\n", "\nWe have just returned from 4 nights. We enjoyed the stay. Villa, pool etc. all as we expected.", "Although not in the heart of Nusa Dua, shuttle buses every two hours with the last leaving Nusa Dua at 10pm, so not a problem. Anyone booked thru a Spreets voucher, take the voucher with you, as Villas Indonesia has not been forwarding on the money to the villas and fortunately Spreets are honouring the vouchers. If you have booked transport from the airport thru Villas Indonesia, no one will turn up. You need to forget that and email Nusa Dua retreat direct and ask them to pick you up. (Quote your Spreets voucher). In fact anyone on a Spreets voucher need to email the villas before arriving, so they know you are coming. Staff are very good and are having a very hard time with guests arriving thru Villa Indonesia and they have no record or money paid and have to turn them away. Spreets have honoured their voucher.\n", "\nArrived at Nusa Dua Retreat to discover that the resort would not honor the $560 voucher we had purchased from Groupon. They claimed that they had never received our money that had been withheld (according to them) by their own booking agents (Villas Indonesia). The only way they would give us a room was by us paying a further $250US per night. This one screams out scam as there was atleast another ten couples that we met that got the same treatment from the resort. If you are thinking about going there have plenty of available credit on your card as an extra $1000US on top of what you have already paid is a real holiday dampened.\n", "\nAirport transfer arrangement was not done properly. We had to wait for more than an hour before we were picked up to transfer to our hotel. :( Wasted our whole morning.", "It wasnt exactly near Nusa Dua and beach, however, there's lots of activities you can do in the hotel. Free vcd to watch, a swimming pool, a sunning deck at the 2nd storey, free spa treatment for 2 rooms. ", "Their room is very spacious with the bathroom, the size of your bedroom which includes a bathtub with tv mounted on the wall. Swimming pool is still okay. However, kitchenette is a little useless with no washing liquid, no pans and pots. ", "Dinner was served in the villa, however ants appeared when the plates were left there overnight. Breakfast was sumptuous, and we chose to go to the restaurant to have our breakfast on the last day instead. Saw a lizard in the room, but I would say room is simply too big to make sure all the corners are taken care of. ", "Enjoyed the spa, and a bathtub (milk spa) was put in place for you and your other half to soak after your massage experience.", "12 hours free charter bus was not really fantastic, perhaps because it is still a touristy kind of tour. However, the guide is friendly and can speak good english.", "Overall, it is still a pleasant trip. Will go back for its swimming pool/spacious room and the staff services!\n", "\nWe bought a deal from Juz Today at S$499 for 3D2N Nusa Dua Retreat Boutique Villa Resort with complimentary 2 hour spa treatment, 12 hours car charter with driver and romantic dinner for 2.", "More review at http://gastronomicaltravel.blogspot.com/", "Quite nice of them to agree to pick us up from Kuta, in replacement of airport transfer. However, the driver was late for at least 40min! The villa was quite remote, you will most likely be lost if you are to take taxi there. ", "Cold towels and welcome drinks were offered when we arrived. Service was far from the advertised 24-hour butler service. Instead of taking care of your requests, they requested you to \"self-service\" and call the different department yourselves.", "However, the Villa was nice. Big spacious villa with lavish-looking furnishing - marble floor, European style furnitures and large painting. The bedroom was cozy with contemporary crystal chandelier. The bed was larger than King size, very comfortable. There are 3 large flat screen TVs, one in the living room, bedroom and bathroom.", "The private pool was surrounded by large transparent windows, connected to the dining room, separated only by a sliding door. It was a bit too deep if you just want a dip. It does not have filtering system thus there were some dirt and dust in the water, not perfect but it was still quite ok for a swim.", "The roof top open air deck was my favourite! You can relax in the comfort of the huge nice sheltered day bed and enjoy the slight breeze, beautiful dusk and starry night skies. Dinner at the roof top with nice beautiful sunset at the backdrop was enjoyable.", "Everything was fine until the sky starts to turn dark. We had difficulty getting the lights on the roof deck. We wasted quite a while waiting for their technician walking in and out of the villa, up and down the roof deck to try to get it fixed. After an hour of hassle, we demanded for a change of villa. ", "Was not satisfied with the changed villa, the pool was dirty, there is slight foul smell at the bathroom and the layout of the bathroom just seems odd. We just made do with it since we need to rush for the spa and we were just too lazy to shift again.\n", "\nTo start with I want to let everyone know what is happening here with anyone that has purchased a Spreets/ Groupon /Offer or other deal on line. The company Villas Indonesia who are the organisers of the packages have been apparently taking the money paid by the online companys (Spreets etc) and not paying the companies that customers are expecting to have paid when they get to Bali eg. Mr Ruckys Taxi are not paid to pick anyone up from the airport and Nusa Dua Retreat never have any guests contact details until they book in so can't contact guests to warn them (not sure why Spreets etc haven't been contacting buyers). From what we were told Spreets and Groupon have been paying the hotel again (as they already paid Villas Indonesia) to make sure guests can check in and not have any problems, however..... Other companies such as Offer are not and when you get there you will have to pay the amount again and then chase the online company you booked with yourself (not something anyone wants to worry about when on holiday). ", "My advise is when you get to Bali airport, go to the cafe to see if the Mr Rucky driver is there, if not go to the ticket counter to buy a ticket for the taxi trip to Nusa Dua retreat for $10 and don't spend time stressing over a driver that may never arrive.", "The resort was fantastic. Staff are so friendly and will go out of their way to help you. The check in was long as we hadn't printed off all our coupons and emails confirming our dates and due to the issues with the Villas Indonesia booking.", "The villas were spacious, clean and comfortable. I had no issues with the standards of the rooms at all. The beds were very comfortable and I loved the TV over the bath. They probably wouldn't be classed as 5* in Australia, but they are certainly better rooms than I've ever stayed in.", "The food was all safe to eat (we had been told to avoid fruits etc in Bali) and delicious. A bit wasteful as even if you only ask for eggs for breakfast they still bring you out a fruit and bread plate!!! Make sure you tell them if you DONT want it.", "Massage package was devine!!! Best massage, scrub and milk bath ever!!! Staff were professional and everything was perfect!", "I used the gym everyday, it had a treadmill, bike, crosstrainer, free weights and two home gym systems. It also had airconditioning and towels and bottled water for guests.", "Staff were very helpful and happy to book taxi's for you. Just be aware that if they book you a taxi, the hotel takes a 20% cut of the daily fare (we paid $20 for half days plus gave the driver an extra $5 tip or $40 for a 8 hour day and $10 tip) They are well worth using as they will drive you whereever you want to go and wait for you. All the drivers we had were fabulous, cars clean and were happy to give suggestions for tourist spots. One driver we used that spoke English quite well and was very trustworthy was Wayan Sugita phone number : [--]. He was very polite and helpful (did worry about whether we would use him for our whole stay a lot, but you have to expect that when most people over there earn less than $10 a day and rely on tourists to earn a living).

I would stay there again if I went back as it suited us perfectly!!!\n", "\nI was down in Bali for 8 days with Nusa Dua Retreat. Situated Ina quite area a bit off the main road, Nusa dua retreat is THE place to recharge ones self and to relax and also include some activities if you do have the energy.", "unlike the busy streets of Kutah or seminyak, this villa is away from many attraction and will take some time in case u need to reach the city considering the small roads.", "However, the staff was simply amazing. The hospitality and the undivided attention to detail and there humble nature is why I will for certain revisit them again in the near future. It isn't the facilities nor the prices that I recall. What I recall is the staff that made our holiday a wonderful one.", "The only down side was that the rain limited us from certain activities.", "\n", "\nLike others, I have read the comments of some reviewers who have given this property terrible ratings (some before they even get there), which seems a bit extreme.

They have followed up all of the necessary paperwork from Villas Indonesia and gone further by wanting to help us organise any activities that we may want to do when we arrive.", "Some responses to emails aren't instant (slowest response was about 20 hours) but most are answered within 2 to 3 hours. Overall, I can't fault their service to date. Their responses are clear, polite and importantly, give me answers to any questions that I may have had.", "My tip: if you have any questions, communicate direct with the Hotel - they are happy to help\n", "\nPurchased a streets deal to stay 4 nights. After reading some of the reviews we were stressing a bit about coming to stay at the resort (even sourced some back up just in case). Firstly, its in Nusa dua, its it a region called kutuh about 15mins from Nusa dua. We spent most of our time in tanjung benoa and we paid about 50k for a cab ride each way. So getting around was easy and not a hassel, we always took a card for the cabbies and they found it no worries. It was actually really nice to drive through parts of Bali we would never have seen if we stayed inside Nusa dua.", " The staff were very welcoming and demonstrated the true spirit of balinese hospitality. Compared to other places we've stayed their English wasn't great but hey this is Bali not the gold coast (and we got to learn a little Indonesian). Despite this everything we asked for we were able to get no problems jut took a little bit longer (Bali time). Seriously ask the staff if you have an issue (we had a smoke alarm start beeping at 5am our first night. Called reception and withing 2mins one of the guys came in with a ladder all sorted).", "The rooms are huge! Everything seemed to be on a grand scale including the sun deck on the roof (make sure you ask for one because not every room has one). Pool was great nice and shady for all but 3hrs in the middle of the day.", "Unfortunately the food wasn't great, cartainly edable however compared to restraunts in the area it was very bland. We had a free dinner as part if the package and we didn't use it. We ordered room service a cpl of times and they didn't come back to collect the plate till the next day. Laundry service was quick any easy and the price was reasonable.", "I want to say the finishes in the room aren't perfect but we don't go holidays to for perfectly painted walls. If that is going to bother you don't stay here. However we found it to be a very comfortable and relaxing place to be.", "The worst part about this hotel is the pathetic company based in Singapore managing it. They took weeks to respond to emails and we could could never connect via phone. They actually telemarketed us on our last day in our room for another holiday!!! This was the only time we ever spoke to them. Booking is defiantly a hassel but is not a reflection on the experience while there.", "For the price we paid (500aus) I would happily do it again.\n", "\nMy partner and I purchased a voucher from ---------- for $899 for 7 nights back in November 2011. We stayed 12-19 Feb 2012.", "Booking:", "Villas Indonesia were very poor. We wanted to confirm they had availability for our dates before purchasing the voucher so I called them up multiple times. They say they'll email you back but they never do, so you have to keep chasing them up. I found whatsapp (----------) was the best way to get quick responses. I had to follow them up many times before they sent me a final check-in voucher, a week before I was to leave for Bali.", "Location:", "BE AWARE that the map detailed on the check-in voucher is WRONG.

There's not much around the area, after all, it is a \"retreat\" so that's to be expected. We had a driver for the whole week so we had no problems with the location at all. If you do take a taxi though, make sure you take a hotel card with you. Would also recommend going to Pandawa Beach which is a 5-10min drive/shuttle bus. It's a clean secluded beach, walk left and you'll see a little raised gazebo for awesome pics! ", "Drivers:", "Rucky personally picked us up from the airport. He was waiting at a table in the Snack Bar cafe (not the Snack Bar convenience store booth, took us a while to realise). For our one-day driver, the driver failed to show up at all after we'd confirmed with Rucky twice the day before. Another driver had to be sent who came 1.5hours later, meaning we missed 1.5hrs of valuable eating time at Boneka Restaurant in St Regis! :(", "Tip: get the reception to confirm any drivers for you as they can speak Indonesian and reduce any miscommunications to Rucky. Our transfer to the airport came on time though! Also beware of drivers that spill out their life story for no reason looking for extra tips. Try to be objective as not sure if you can trust them. Some may also take you to souvenir shops, but just say no and you should be fine.", "Villas:", "After reading the recent reviews of the place, we were preparing for the worst. When we opened the doors of our villa, we were amazed, it exceeded our expectations. Extremely spacious, everything clean and well-maintained, no weird bathroom smell. There were a couple of cosmetic faults on the walls and in the cupboards but that's trivial. Pool looked clean, although I didn't dip my head in. I wouldn't drink the cold water from the drinking fountain as well as it looked really cloudy. The hot water drinking tap was fine though.", "Food:", "Good selection of options for breakfast, we tried something new every day. Don't expect to have all the utensils/ingredients required to make a coffee though. They always seem to forget either the milk, sugar or tea spoons! But the staff are extremely friendly so we had a lot of patience. They really do try their best. Expect breakfast to last 30mins as it's a bit of a wait to get all the food out. Let them know if you're in a rush though, as then they get everything out within 15mins as we experienced on one of our sleep-in days!", "Honeymoon dinner at the pool restaurant was pretty average. Barramundi and prawns tasted defrosted and the red bean paste was awful. But hey, it was free, can't complain.", "Massage:", "The free welcome and 2hr (1hr holistic, scrub, shower and milk bath) massage was surprisingly really good! Wish it lasted longer! The spa was really clean and staff very friendly.", "Overall, it was great value for money, would definitely recommend this place, but only if you get a deal and have a driver.\n", "\nMy daughter and I purchased a spreets voucher to the Nusa Dua Resort and upon arrival we were greeted with a refresher towel and welcome drink.

The staff were more than helpful in every way. One evening we had a 2 hour spa that was so relaxing, and our voucher also included a driver for one day. We were fortunate that we also had an English speaking guide. We went to the Safari Park which wa great and then wanted to go to the Mtahari Shopping Centre and to the factory outlets.

We were then told there is a complimentary lunch or dinner included in our package (werent aware of this) - so it seemed the opportunity to use the lunch.", "An hour later we were shown to our villa (#103) - from the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the size and facilities.

Sometimes hash brown hot sometimes cold. We chose not to have beef ham OR chicken sausage OR bacon after the first day (couldnt have all unless they charge extra!). Just not to our taste. If you had an asian breakfast & wanted toast as well, they would charge extra.Cost not the issue - more just principal.", "Toast is brought out before the egg etc along with a croissant & a danish & toast would then get cold.

One aspect which can be improved is the twice daily shuttle service to Kuta area. The timing is rather inconvenient with one around 9am and another at 2pm. Taxi rides(which the hotel will be happy to arrange for you) to Jimbaran area is around Rp50,000 while to Kuta area is around Rp90,000. Both fares are by meter and the taxi they used are from reliable companies. There is also a shuttle to the nearest beach every 2hrs. The beach is by far, one of the best i've been to. It's very secluded and other than the local seaside village, there is practically no one there. No hawkers/peddlers pestering you with their goods. It's just the sound of the sea and nothing else.", "The staff are very helpful and will attend to your request almost immediately. Their level of English is not the best in the world, but good enough to be understood. Just remember to speak slow and clear to them in order to be understood.

The rooms were fantastic and we had a great time.", "I found the staff to be enthusiastic and keen to help, and whilst their English wasn't that great, with a bit of work, patience and a few smiles and kind words, I found that I was able to get anything I wanted sorted out.

There are some lovely hotels on the beach in Nusa Dua, but they are more expensive, and busy with tourists and sellers.

Villas Indonesia are slow in responding to requests and cut you off if you phone them (in Singapore). The issues we had with the isolation of this hotel, the overpriced food and beverages, the appalling pool maintenance, smelly bathroom, poor equipping of rooms are \"same same\".

The resort is not what it claims to be. It is not 5 star, it is possibly 3. The remoteness is fine if you want to be restricted to the villas with overpriced,very ordinary food and drinks. The pool is fine as long as you don't put your head under the water. The flies are worse than an Aussie bush BBQ. We did not use their driver pick up service because we were coming from Ubud but our taxi driver also had trouble finding the resort. We were so disappointed that we decided to return to Ubud. Even though we had a full day with a driver included in our Spreets package (which we had not used ) they would not provide a driver to take us back to Ubud. I also had trouble dealing with Villas Indonesia. They would not respond to emails and when you phone them you either get disconnected or put through to someone with limited English. Spreets are also not able to be contacted by phone and your complaints by email are just dismissed.Spreets you need to get the message that for every unhappy customer you will lose at least 10 more. The word is out!\n", "\nOkay, first off the reviews seem all over the place. It's either 1 star or 5 star in most of the reviews. The way I see it is that the people who have given it 1 star are used to 5 star WESTERN places where everything is perfectly done. The people who gave it 5 stars are people like my partner and I who took advantage of a deal and researched it and knew what to expect. We are used to 3-4 star places in Australia so when we got here we were blown away. So this review is written from our point of view as middle class people! ", "The actual villa was amazing, 3 x huge tvs and HEAPS of space. Bed was insanely comfy and the room was pretty much sound proof when you close the glass doors on either side. The bath if gorgeous but did take a while to fill up on hot. It's Bali and things are never done perfectly so theres a couple things off like a kinda weird smell in the bathroom and the curtains not closing completely so a little light in the morning and some other very minor building faults. The pool was good fun with nice water features, refreshingly cold but a little slimey/mouldy on the edges. The rooftop was good for tanning with two sun beds and a little gazebo with couches under it if you prefer to stay out of the sun. It's pretty difficult for anyone to see in from our point of view, they need to go out of their way and even then you can only see half of the rooftop. ", "I can't even stress enough how isolated it is, it's in the middle of nowhere, but some people might like the serenity. It'll take at least 20 min to get most places. With spreets the driver for the day was awesome, we also hired him for the 2nd day (if you book with Spreets ask for Wayan from 'Mr. Rucky', he was amazing, took us WHEREVER we wanted and booked everything for us). As there isn't much to do at the hotel My suggestion would be to stay here max 4 nights and plan any day trips you are going to do such as lembongan island, bali safari and white water rafting for these days like we did. Otherwise, hire a driver and eat out and only spend mornings and night times in the villa. We paid 100,000 rupiah (about $12) to get there from kuta which isn't bad between two people.

The breakfast was awesome and includes continental no matter what you order, though not always on time, either early or late. The staff really do try, but can't speak english much at all so that makes it hard. Make sure you say things twice and double check they understand. The connections go to kuta (good, one in the morning and one about 2pm), the beach (never went but i'm sure it was nice), and bali collection (if you want to pay the same prices as home for things or just get lunch/dinner then go).

Neither did the wi-fi. The villa was locked in by other surrounding villas which created a feeling of a cave. Horrible. It was mostly dirty. Sun deck was on the roof and away from the pool.

The phone in the room did not work so we had to order the room service by making yet another roaming call. Disastrous. ", "The menu is limited and extremely poor value. It's as if the proprietor realised that guests are fo the most part trapped and hence have no choice but to dine in the hotel. One of the best examples of price gouging I have come across. Travelling in Asia you mostly expect to be paying extravagant prices as a tourist while the same item is sold to locals for a tenth of the cost.

We then range the hotel, and they collected us and tried to charge us $ 50 for it. When we refused to pay it as it was their stuff up, they made an unauthorised charge to my credit card for the $50, which I had to dispute with my credit card company. Decor was a cheap attempt at the Versace look, it was hideous and did not capture the Bali atmosphere. Putrid sewerage smell in bathroom. Dirty Pool. Sun lounge area was huge but no where near the pool. Floor to ceiling glass meant that you had full light at 6am. Staff were untrained, and poor customer service was commonplace; reservations phone number got diverted to our villa when unattended ! Lastly, the bloody mary I ordered was a tomato smoothie with no vodka, at the cost of AU$24. Don't stay here - go to Seminyak or Legian.\n", "\nWe also purchased a Spreets voucher for part duration of our honeymoon. I am so glad we had somewhere else to move onto after this shambles of a place. First of the taxi drivers have no clue where this place is, it is not in Nusa Dua, but about 15-20 mins away and in the middle of NO WHERE!!!!! Including in our voucher was coupons for a free dinner which we decided to use on Night One as we wanted to stay in our villa. The food is 3rd world. Absolutely disgusting. It is so bad I ended up getting food poisoning and had to call the International Doctor out because I got so sick and was in bed for 3 days. The staff were apologetic, however no offer of anything in compensation or loss of time on our honeymoon. I could go on and on about how bad this place is, but I will leave one more parting comment and that is if you think the flies are bad in Perth, Australia - think again this place should be called the Fly Retreat! it is that bad.\n", "\nUnlike other reviewers, our experience was terrible.

I was a little hesistant before we went, as you can never be sure if you are getting value for money until you are actually there... Well I can tell you it was definately worth every cent. We stayed one night in Kuta and the resort were happy to pick us up from our hotel and take us there. The staff were so lovely when we arrived and we were checked into our villa/palace. We literally both screamed in delight when they opened the villa doors for us. It was stunning. There was beautiful artwork on the wall, marble floors, 3 plasma tvs (including one over the bath!) the pool was amazing and we had ocean views from the top floor/outdoor area which included day beds, a bbq, outdoor setting etc. The breakfast each day was lovely and the spa package which was included was again, amazing. We used the free shuttle bus to check out panawa beach (not far from the hotel) which was nice, and to the local shopping area. We used our full day charter driver to go back to Kuta for some more shopping, the Discovery and Marine Park at Ubud, then finally to Jimbaran, where we had fresh seafood at a restaurant on the sand as the sun set. Overall, this holiday was fantastic. I would go there again without any hestition. The staff are so nice and the villa was exceptional. It is a little bit away from everything (about half an hour from Kuta) so it is nice and quiet. So if you are hesistant about going here, or getting a voucher, go for it!

It's not actually in the heart of Nusa Dua, as all of the other hotels are (they are all in one strip on the beach), it's in a different suburb (??) called Kutuh. Taxi drivers may find it difficult to locate. It's about 20 minutes from the other hotels. You cannot walk anywhere. You are basically stuck there (though there was a large collection of scooters just near the hotel that you could presumably hire - we didn't check this out - if you are brave enough to drive in the Balinese traffic!). They do have shuttle buses - drop off and pick up at \"Bali Collection\" (think of a western open shopping mall - with western prices - although you can walk through this to the beach - this is in the middle of the other big hotels), drop off and pick up at the local beach (Pandawa beach - don't bother - not what we were expecting - you cannot swim there, it's an area where locals farm seaweed, and there's really just shanty's along the beach, with one cafe - they do put out lounge chairs and an umbrella, so ok if you want to sit there and read for 2 hours), and drop off only to Kuta. If you haven't been out for the day you either have to take the shuttle to Bali Collection, or eat at the hotel. Which, for Bali, is overpriced (though admittedly probably expected in that type of hotel).

Also, the kitchen was not actually functional - though the oven and range top looked amazing, there was only 1 saucepan (no other utensils), no sharp knives, 2 sets of cutlery, though only 1 plate.

Part of our voucher also included a driver for a full day, which was good because the tours listed in their booklet are also overpriced. And definitely make sure that you spend some time elsewhere in Bali, not just here. We also spent some time in Sanur, one block from the main street, and although that place was very basic it was fantastic to be able to just walk out and grab some food, swim in the ocean, shop, get a massage, or find a nice cold Bintang (and of course, all at a fraction of the cost at this hotel).\n", "\nUnlike the name might suggest, this hotel is in fact about 20 minutes drive away from Nusa Dua area.

The breakfast is quite good, with a variety of asian and international food. I couldn't stop asking for the banana pancakes :)", "We spent our first day at the hotel beach club, transport is organised by the hotel and has an hourly schedule. The beach is very nice, at the very end of the beach strip, but the sea/water wasn't impressive at all. However, this is an issue almost everywhere around the island, the tidal difference is extreme, and will turn blue deep shallow waters into a vast dry seaweed-covered sea bed in a matter of an hour.", "The rest of the days, we went on different tours, rented a motorbike and visited other beaches to realise that the nearby Geger beach is much better to be at.", "We didn't really try their lunch/dining menu, mainly because we were outside most of the day, but the prices were very reasonable, and similar to the many restaurants around the area. On the first evening back to the room, I went out on the balcony to meet face to face with a perfect sample of a gecko. They are everywhere in the island and this one was friendly, too. We even got stuck on the balcony, its door locking behind us, and the hotel staff got us out of trouble in no time; I was even considering to jump into the pool, from the second floor.", "One thing I didn't understand is that where the hotel guests were.

One morning we had biking, where we had to leave early, however the restaurant were very accommodating and opened early for us all.", "It was lovely to lounge around the two pools here, and the grounds were always immaculate.

The dining room has a nice atmosphere and is well priced compared with the surrounding restaraunts.they have free transport to kuta every day and an hourly shuttle bus to and from their private beach and the large shopping centre called bali collection all over this hotel is a friendly and quiet place to stay the tariffs are more than competative with other hotels in the area\n", "\nThis gem in the heart of Nusa Dua offering a great opportunity at a good price. The rooms are possibly the largest I have seen in my many trips to Bali. Cleanliness is of a very high standard and there are variations to suit every traveller's needs Staff are extremely helpful.

On the list for my next trip hopefully in November 2015.\n", "\nA beautiful resort with fantastic spacious rooms and 2 great pools, staff are very friendly but a little too limited in there English, but no doubt this will improve in time.

Nothing was a trouble, even a shuttle to Kuta at a late notice and a courtesy room to shower after our check out, before we went to the airport.

Terima Kasih - Peter and Juanita AUSTRALIA.\n", "\nWe are members so stay here most visits to Bali. The rooms are great and the staff at the front desk and around the property are always very friendly. I'm not a big fan of the Nusa Dua area but this is not too bad. A short walk to Bali Collection provides plenty of restaurant and shopping options. There are tons of places to eat right around the hotel too. The downside for me was when they wanted to charge us $25 U.S./night for an extra bed for my five year old when our membership is supposed to provide us with a sleep 4 room anyways and we were provided with just a sleep two. Luckily we didn't have any other adults with us. Membership does not always seem to be worth it. Also breakfast is not included with membership and the breakfast buffet was ridiculously priced. Most expensive than it would be back home. There is a gym on site but I was very disappointed with it. It consists of a yoga mat, some Dumbbells, an exercise bike and two treadmills. When I went to use it, it appeared closed but the front desk sent someone to open it for me. The air con had been off so it was way too hot to work out in there. Of course we will stay here again as we are members but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone.\n", "\nUpon arrival, we were greeted warmly with the hotel staff and driver at the airport.

Great layout with pool, beach, shopping corners and spa. The hotel understands to bring close the nature and it was just amazing to see from the hotel lobby how the birds are fishing for their breakfast! We loved the experience. The pool is great, however the water could be cleaner. Beach is also nice, only the plastic sunbeds should be replaced. A Hyatt should allow himself a more authentic sunbed, especially with those beautiful gardens on the compound. It somehow sticks into ones eye in Bali, where everything is natural. The room was ok, spacious, fruit basket and good service. Only one negative remark, it was too dark, not enough daylight. Great Japanese restaurant, perfect teppanyaki dinner with great Chefs and guests. At check in the the refreshment was ok, however the towel was ok, however not scented! We missed that. Close shopping center, great entertainment, all in all, a good feeling.\n", "\nWe love this Hotel, nice and quite place, very friendly staff\u2026 The hotel was renovated few month ago, so its look new, clean and very comfortable.

If it were right at the beach, it'd be a five star property. As it so happens, it's a bit of a distance away from the beach, but the resort has hourly shuttles to its private beach area complete with cabanas and bar where you can enjoy the ocean. The property itself is beautiful, especially the huge Balinese lobby and the pool. The service was excellent -- everyone from the front-desk staff to the restaurant staff were very attentive and helpful.", "The restaurant facing the pool is a nice place for a meal. We didn't have breakfast included in our stay, but for about 100K Rupiah they cooked us a personalized \"buffet breakfast\" that would have cost much more in any restaurant. We usually took the shuttle to the beach at around 9:00 AM and stayed there past high tide (close to noon) when it's nice to swim. Then lunch at resort and sometimes dinner as well. If you choose, there is Cafe Pause across the street for coffee/breakfast/snack. Also, if you turn left after walking out of the resort and walk about half a kilometer and then turn right, you'll find more shops and lots of restaurants as well.", "For four days we hired a personal guide who took us around the island in his car. By the way, the guide was excellent as well -- his name is Nyoman Murdock and you can contact him by email at nyoman.murdock@gmail.com -- we had arranged our day tours with him prior to arriving in Bali. If you stay in The Grand Bali Nusa Dua, we'd highly recommend this approach -- enjoy the beach a few days and take some day tours for 3 or 4 days. You'll see the island and always have a great place to come back to and relax :-)\n", "\nThe hotel has a Balinese grand lobby to welcome our early arrival. It was a low season so we were accommodated for an early check in. Room is very spacious with a mini balcony looking out to the garden. The layout of the bathroom is fit for a queen with a supersize mirror. The toiletries are not in plastic but in beautiful ceramic containers. Restaurant is equally beautiful with very helpful and charming waiters/waitresses. They brighten our early morning breakfasts. We would usually bring in fresh papayas after tours/shopping and they would prepare it with banana leaves, sliced and cut creatively.", "They have hourly shuttle to their private beach club that adjoins those of Marriott and Mercure. Best time to go swimming is early morning when the water is high tide. Though the beach has a little bit stronger waves than Philippine beaches, it was also ideal for surfing practice. On the way back, we would usually ask to be dropped off along the souvenir stalls for \" pasalubong\" ( gifts) Best money exchange rate is just beside the hotel.", "There is another daily complimentary shuttle to Discovery mall in Kuta beach every 10.30am. On the way back by taxi( taxis with meters save money) we would have several stops at interesting places &sites. Tours all over the island is plentiful. They are all reasonably priced and drivers speak English (very gracious, too). Weather is very similar to the Philippines. Sunny and cool with intermittent rains.\n", "\nI recently had the misfortune of having booked 4 nights at the Grand Bali. A single word comes to mind, awful. Both the check in and check out was so unprofessional. The breakfast was limited. I love Indonesian foods but this was bland, with hardly any choices. The only positive at breakfast was the staff at the restaurant did at least smile and did try their best. The gym? A treadmill does not constitute a gym, because that all that was in there. It was difficult ordering a taxi from there. The hotel is not even close to a beach. I am a fast walker and it took me 40 minutes. The room was clean and the bathroom large. What lets this hotel down is the front desk staff. They seem not interested.\n", "\nMostly nice hotel budget friendly for Nusa Dua area but overpriced if your room allocation not good.", "We found the staff to be very nice like most Balinese people. However we wee there in November and the hotel was very quiet. We booked a premier room, our son booked a deluxe. We were placed at as far opposite ends as possible.

He asked my husband where he was from and said 'if you are from Bali you listen, but because you are from Madura you don't listen'. My husband was in every aspect polite and understanding. How discriminating. He then went and got another staff member in dark green, also an older man and he then was very aggressive and rude. We asked him not to be disrespectful and be polite. I do not understand why he was so rude when we were understand in regards to that being your area and we had to spend 300,000. Rethink who your staff are, my husband is very offended.

We found some great little restaurants, and they all drive you home - Mai Mai has barbecued seafood sold by weight and then grilled, as well as a variety of other dishes. We ate there twice and the food was delicious. Laguna was another great little restaurant offering free welcome drinks, garlic bread and salad bar.

Bad that you are not right at the beach or surrounded by restaurants and shops. Good that it is a quiet place to get some sleep and not be harassed by hawkers and taxi drivers.

My dad bribed the water boys on our first day there to give us a couple of extra bottles (as the free ones were TINY and there was no other source of good quality water unless you paid very high prices for it). So, from that day on the water boys wouldn't put our free water in our rooms unless we bribed them!! Not good.", "We had the best suite you could get in the main hotel area (the next thing up is a villa - they looked lovely) which was nice, however the toilet in one bathroom stank, the showers leaked all over the floor around a toilet (which doesn't make one feel confident in where that water came from!). The bath leaked and we had to call a plumber to fix it. The door to the verandah was very hard to open. ", "The rude Japanese guests (speak to any Balinese person and see how they feel about the way many (most?) Japanese guests treat the Balinese and you'll see I'm not kidding) are not the fault of the hotel, however they just added to our unhappiness there.

I feel sorry for the staff to say this, but I don't think other people should get caught out.\n", "\nOur stay was just wonderful and fantastic value for money. We had visited bali several times before and like to stay somewhere differenet each time. We were travelling with another couple and found this hotel really quaint and surprisingly catered for our every need. The rooms were overly spacious with bamboo flooring and a wonderful big marble bathroom with seperate toilet and shower. Every room overlooked the pool. Our husbands enjoyed the open air bar with pool table to relax with a few bintangs, my girlfriend and i preferred to make the most of the in house spa which was both boutique and enduring and very reasonably priced. Although the hotel is in Nusa Dua, its certainly not the big flash hotels you would normally expect of Nusa and is well away from all the big 5 Star on the beach type of resorts, but that didnt bother us as the hotel was quaint and cozy, it also has a free shuttle down to 'their' own beach club decked out with bar which you can order food from and sun lounges positioned under thatched huts for shaded relaxation on the beach. Shops werent directly out the front door from the resort but a 500m walk down the road takes you to some wonderful restaurants and shops to buy all your bargains. Although not central to shops, restaurants and the hype bali provides, we found this hotel a nice quiet place to return after busy shopping in kuta. The staff were more than helpful and friendly, the food was wonderful (no bali belly) which was a nice relief. If you want to tour the island the staff are more than willing to set you up with a driver (a family friend in most cases). Over a few bintangs in the open air sports bar one of the staff offered for one of his brothers to take our husbands to a surfing beach up on the coast and even arranged boards for them, which they enjoyed. I highly recommend this hotel if you dont mind being a bit out of the way from all the hype that bali offers, and just want to chill out by the pool or over a beverage in the bar area. A Golf Course is within walking distance, No pool bar in the complex but the staff are happy to serve you drinks and snacks poolside.

The room, pool, and other areas were just as amazing! The staff was great! My biggest disappointment was the condition of the beach. I did not mind taking the bus, but it was very dirty (Not so much as garbage but more along the lines of seaweed, twigs, branches, etc. ). Another disappointment, but not as much, was the food. Very limited choices. Also my wife got sick from eating a hamburger. However, there is a main road, at the corner, that has several restaurants, all of which will do anything (even offer you special deals, extras, like dessert!) to get you in.

Disappointing in the sense that it is not really as good as it seems. The mall wasn't that near to the hotel. Don't be fooled. The beach area wasn't that fantastic as there is no facilities compared to Hyatt and the Adoya near by. The place seems run down, the walls have cracks, the room with webs at corners and ants were attracted by food in the room. The place need to be upgraded. The bath tub was really worn out and the shower and toilet area are really old. Need to refurbished as the room I stayed in seems tired.

However, the staff were a dream, they kindly called taxis for us every time we asked. Other than Bali Collection for food, you could go to The Bay Bali as well.

Even if there were no bottles of wines, my wooden gifts would also be broken because of the bag fall. You really need to train your front office staff in handling guest complaints.

Instead i had to argue with them for half an hour and explain to them like you would to a child that the cost of them putting a bed in my room is free for them and it just sits outside the room and considering it said i have paid for all of this the very least they could do is provide it.

However, I found some food issue which will be described below. ", "-There was also a bar on the roof top, however it was closed during our stay, not sure, maybe because of Nyepi Day. The price incredibly fair and quite cheap for those area, however I found out it cheaper on the Nyepi package they have.", "-Free wifi", "Cons: the lighting in the room was at minimum, I mean for suite you gotta give option for more lighting, and let the customer choose for its preference.", "- We found damp-smelly in the bathroom, I guess because the aircon wasn't on upon arrival, and weather (Bali humidity level) can play a critical role.", "- It needs some music to enlighten the welcoming-lobby experience. The lobby was great, it just \"empty\".", "- In my opinion, the staff were too quiet, I hope they'd understand as part of this industry, customer service highly needed. I just found out more facilities and service they have from this website, during our check in staff was just simply provide basic information.", "- Pool were located in the middle of the hotel,and again there's no music, so you can hear clearly when someone talk on the pool from the 5th floor. Inconvenience.", "- Breakfast served in large shaving dishes, however in low portion. At the time, it was at least 15 people in the restaurant, the 3 items of the hot food is running out. When they happen to topped it up, it was only with one small plate, and it could only feed 2 people, so basically gone in literally 3 second. I thought they were in the hurry, but after half an hour in the restaurant, the conditions unchanged. I still see the food in the buffet is only for 2-3 people. While the closing time is not for another hour. The staff seems busy running back and forth through the kitchen. So whats bothering me the most, why served buffet? Why don't simply offer ala carte where everyone can order from the menu. It just silly to see large shaving dish with a little food in it. People would normally expect breakfast buffet loaded with hot food.", "-On Nyepi night, dinner served on function room underground floor, It was short-staff. It was only 1 staff who did everything upon our arrival. The caesar salad was just a plain salad, and it turned out the dressing and croutons came in 15 min gap. I asked a napkin because my partner got an allergic to dust (function room had dust smell). The staff seems realize he forgot to get a napkin,and took a while until he got napkin for every table. At this situation, I would prefer staff give more attentive to prioritize a napkin to my partner first.

My hubby and I were attracted by the photos, but were quite disappointed by the location when we were there.. 1st impression: we were welcomed by friendly staff n served with nice drinks.

So we asked to change another room.", "At the other room, nothing is as good too. Aircon is not cold though I adjusted it down to the lowest - 18\u00b0C, it took around 2hrs to get cool.. The toilet door got a loud squeaky sound when open n close. Foot steps or talking can be heard outside the room clearly. Late night 11:30pm to 12mn still can hear the stray dogs barking continuously. On our 2nd day, we were out for almost the whole day & were back to hotel at 10pm. My hubby realised that our door is not closed, we quickly look around the whole room & luckily nothing was lost. it must be the housekeepers who forgot to close the door after making the room.

Absolutely value for money.\n", "\nI've stayed in the Amaroossa Suite for 2 nights in October. It was a great place to stay. The front desk officer was really helpful. Shuttle driver was really friendly and share information that he knows during the shuttle service. However, the washroom ventilation needs to be improve as it feels kind of stuffy in it. Besides that, do clean the private pool daily as there are a lot of earth worm in the pool. Last but not least, do please pick up the phone whenever a guest called as I left some laundry in the hotel and when I tried to call back to resume my laundry, no one was there to pick up my phone and i flew back to Malaysia.

We notified them of guests arrival schedule one week prior and call during the day to make sure guests are being picked up. We even organised external transport to pick guests when Amaroossa car is busy - note they only have two cars for airport transfer. Their transport people are disorganised. Missed picking up three guests, two guests had to wait 1.5 hours at the airport, did not communicate if they are late, one driver was too lazy to wave and hold the sign for guest that they have to search for this driver on top of million signs at the airport.

The only problem is the location is too far from the beach... If you want to have a drink or a Spa at Kuta beach, you have to take taxi (~IDR 80k)back to the hotel. We book from Groupon in Singapore and it comes with a 30 min complementary massage outside the hotel. It'll be better if hotel has its own Spa room. Besides, hotel provides shuttle bus to Kuta Discovery mall and Nusa Dua Bali collection daily, which saves us some transportation fee. But the frequency is only two times a day.

Heard nothing of the hotel before staying there, it is simply a blind try.", "But I am so so so happy with my stay! I stayed in an executive suite with a king size bed, pity there wasn't anymore sea view ones. The room was clean and the bed was really comfy. The staff is friendly and I really wanna thank Nova for her quick replies to my email and the receptionist were very attentive to my needs when I called them from the room.", "I must make special mention of the food! The food is super delicious! Don't worry about having no food to eat coz the food here is delicious and there is 24 hours room service so anytime u wanna eat, just pick up the phone!", "I didn't get to call in room service though I very much wanted to after having ate lunch at the restaurant downstairs. All I can say is 4 days and 3 nights is never enough here. I would go back for a full week stay the next time I am back in Bali! As I sat in the car to go to the airport this morning, I just couldn't hold back my tears. The staff is so friendly and makes good recommendations for places to dine at. My heartfelt thanks to all the staff there.\n", "\nWe picked Amaroossa Suite Bali for our 2 nights get away and this is a birthday gift for my daughter.

Thanks for the birthday cake suprised :), it was a momerable birthday stay.\n", "\nI was staying last weekend with my family. i was staying at the family room on the fifth floor. Exclusive location,with harbor view and new Nusa Dua tollway above the sea was very amazing. ask for the fifth floor so you could have the amazing view. Don't forget to enjoy the Candu Bar at the roof top, you could also enjoy the sunrise and the sunset here. The rooms is very spacious, decorate with details and the bed also comfort that I ever had.. the staff was so friendly and as an indonesian i feel welcome...I will recommend to all my friends to stay.\n", "\nFor any other travelers wanting to stay here, you might want to learn balinese as they don't understand english well...also if you have food allergies stay away they don't understand. ...we were suppose to get free massages and welcome drink which we did not recieve also 15% to 20% off in the resturant but when we came back on our daily trip the resturant was closed at 7.30pm everyday and also the bar was closed so we couldn't even get a drink, felt like a jail as there is nowhere to go but your room as it's in the slum part of Nusa Dua.....swimming pool is small but looks big in pictures but if 8 people got in it would be crowded...we had a 6 night stay but checked out after the 2nd night to a far better resort...my advice stay away......\n", "\nFrom the moment we were picked up from the bustling airport by the hotel's driver, I knew I was going to enjoy my first stay in Bali.", "I could not fault my stay at the Amaroossa Hotel.

Out bed was enormous. I couldn't even tell me partner was in it! I had the best sleeps.", "The rooftop bar has an amazing view out over Nusa Dua, but is the only place in the hotel where you can't get Wifi.

Dreamy king bed, big bathroom, beautiful high quality finishings and the private plunge pool.", "There are some downsides to staying here, but they're purely a matter of perception and organisation. If you're wanting to do lots of sightseeing and lots of trips etc. then the location of Nusa Dua as a whole is not ideal, but this is not specific to the Amaroossa. If you just want to chill out in your room, by the pool and maybe get a taxi to a few close by restaurants, massages and Nusa Dua beach then it is perfect.", "The hotel has a new general manager who is very friendly! We only had one small issue to raise with him and he was onto it straight away. As above, the service is faultless.", "There is one small issue with e restaurant bar service that I hope the general manager will sort out. They do have a large drinks menu for their bar, but it seems at half of the things on it were unavailable. If the GM can help them smooth out their bar process, the place will be perfect.", "But this is nitpicking and being fussy!! ", "Would I stay here again? Yes.\n", "\nWe left booking our hotel for a business trip to Bali to the last minute! In fact is was just 30 hours before arrival that we confirmed the Amaroossa as the hotel we thought would be most suitable - half-way between airport (15-20 minutes) and Convention Centre in the heart of Nusa Dua. And what a good choice it was. Quiet, compact and friendly. It was also good value for money. Far enough off the main road to be quiet, set on a hillside with views from the roof bar across the bay and a small swimming right in the center of the hotel itself. While the rooms were well air-conditioned and extremely comfortable the restaurant was more Bali style, open with a nice through breeze. Only opened seven months ago, the managing director took a personal interest in his guests' experience, introducing himself at breakfast and checking that all was in order. Don't book here if you want a beach-side hotel or a typical Bali resort, however, if you're like us and want quite, comfortable and off the beaten track hotels but with all the home comforts then consider the Amaroossa Suites at Nusa Dua if you're headed to Bali.\n", "\nStayed in this hotel as a couple. Hotel is located at Nusa Dua which is a great location as it is near the popular jimbaran beach. Other popular places like Kuta and semniyak are also quite near the hotel. Hotel staffs are helpful and nice. Rooms are very clean and well taken care of. ", "There are however two areas in which the hotel may look to improve. One is the buffet breakfast, as it has a very limited choice of dishes. Second is that the swimming pool's water is a little dirty during our 5 days worth of stay. ", "Overall, the hotel is worth it for the price we paid. I'm happy abd satisfied with our choice of staying in Amaroossa Hotel.\n", "\nOverview: Been to Bali many times, stayed in 3/4 & 5 star properties depending how 'special' the reason of the trip. Stayed in a lot of hotels in Nusa Dua and feel comfortable rating this hotel against their competition. Stayed for a period of 12 nights. I write this review honestly in light of the long stay we had there and knowing that on the last day we met the new General Manager (who started the day before) and listened to our feedback (upon request) and vowed he would look into a lot of the issues we raised and fix things. ", "Pros: ", "Bed is the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in. Beautiful. Do not think I have slept as comfortably in my whole life - not even in our brand new bed at home. Beautiful linen, lovely pillows and as mentioned amazing bed. ", "Room size was fantastic value. One of the largest rooms for the $$. Very spacious and comfortable with room to sleep, sit and relax and not be in each other's way all the time. Great room with lovely fittings. ", "Main pool looks pretty and although very small and not very private, it is good looking and the water is clean and maintained. They have done the gardens in this area very well and it looks very inviting. ", "Cons: ", "Started in pool suite which was an upgrade we received via a Wot.if special. This room was the darkest and gloomiest room I have ever stayed in. Anywhere. Furniture-wise it was tastefully decorated and was a 'good looking' room however not one bit of light came in and it was depressing. Pool outside was filthy with dirt sitting all over the sides and on the bottom of it. Would never swim in here unless I wanted a urinary tract infection. Moved rooms. New room much brighter and felt like we were actually on holiday and not in a detention camp. ", "Maintenance of Hotel was very lax considering the hotel has only been open for 7 months. This was a let down. Small things like, our main door to our room. To open we had to push VERY hard to allow the gas thing to realise the door was being opened. Then, to close, you need to leave your room 5 mins early so that you can pull until your heart is content or simply stand there until the gas thing allows the door to shut. Super frustrating considering, that a cleaner attended the room every day and did not once think to use initiative to call maintenance to fix door. ", "Card locked us out randomly and we had to get card re-cut for no reason. ", "Ants in huge nest on walls, on benches, etc. Found ants crawling on us in bed. Got to love waking up to the smell of ants on your skin. To hotel credit, once we told them, when we returned that day our room has been treated for ants and we only saw one or two after this. ", "Balcony, PVC plastic guard on the inside of the balcony to ensure people don't squeeze through to their death (I'm guessing) was cracked and broken off. Sharp edges as a result. Balcony metal itself was loose and after both my husband and I looked over the edge and held on to the railing we realised would not take much to go straight over. MASSIVE problem! Very dangerous. Can just see it on the news now. For a new hotel - seems scary that it already has flaws like this?", "Room Service menu was not in rooms at all. Called to get one. Ordered food to our room 2 times. On the first night we arrived and on the last night. First night ordered a club sandwich. First of all they had to call our room to ask us what was on a club sandwich. We happily told them, considering it was our first night and we were in high spirits. 45 mins later our order arrived. Midnight at this stage. We were asleep. Woke up and received meal. (Never waited 45 mins for a sandwich and chips in my life!) The sandwich was on cold bread, not toasted and had no chicken (like we confirmed on phone). It had a piece of red, un-identified meat on it and about a bottle of mayo and cucumber. Just poor. Called up and asked whether it could be changed for something. Person took call and said words to the effect of oh ok, ok, etc. No-one came to our room. We did not bother - it set the tone pretty clearly. ", "Last night in hotel we ordered Nasi Goreng - my fav! Had it all trip as I do every year. This Nasi-goreng was the most gluggiest, foul tasting Nasi-goreng I have ever eaten. I was able to hold by my 2 fingers a huge clump of it up in the air to show my husband what I meant. Ate 4 mouthfuls and left it outside door for collection. Husband had spaghetti left nearly the entire bowl. Another fail. ", "Breakfast, average. Nothing much to say. Stayed 12 nights, ate breakfast once. Yet, for the first 4 days we got a call between 8:30 and 9:30 to tell us why we not come down to breakfast as breakfast was closing soon. I had to ask them finally - we are asleep, if we want breakfast we will come down. No need to call. No calls after this. Told new manager that breakfast was very average compared to other hotels, he said we are not 5 star hotel. Doesn't matter! Had breakfast at 2 competitors very close to this hotel and it was far better and they are not 5 star either. ", "Fire Alarm, minor detail I guess but needs to change procedure. Asleep in bed 9am. Loud fire alarm goes off. We are straight up fearing the worst as this has never happened to us in Bali. Getting dressed and out the door to be told 'drill, drill'. Nice if they sent a memo around to tell us that a drill would be going off? Type of thing that needs to be told to the guest the night before with a memo under the door. ", "Security, lack of security compared to other hotels. Mostly, they sat out the back looking at you as you pulled up on moped. To my utter shock and horror I even witnessed a 'security guard' and I use the term loosely, throw a rock at a local dog who was doing nothing wrong. Him and roughly 5 other staff laughed about it. I said to him very angrily 'you like it if I throw a rock at you' no reply. More laughing. Disgraceful to see. I have respect for the Balinese culture but throwing a rock an animal who was walking down the street is poor, poor, poor. Never seen this by 'hotel staff' before. I was furious. ", "STAFF: Apart from Harris and the team in the kitchen who would bring us drinks and food when we were at the pool bar, the staff were very average to say the least. A BIG shake up needs to occur. Restaurant staff were polite, kind and as far as we know respectful towards us. Thank you to these people. Good work. ", "The rest, reception staff, bell boys, security, drivers, etc were very rude and unprofessional. Bali is supposed to be a place full of hospitality (all our trips here including our own wedding in Bali we have adored these people and the place itself) and these people had little regard for us, and others. I was, by the end of the trip appalled by these people. We were not greeted at all, they were too busy gossiping, laughing, on their phones, texting etc. Upon leaving they stood by the front entrance staring at us. It was a contempt for people who are paying for them to have a job. Utterly disappointing. BIG changes need to happen in these areas. Total new staff in reception is needed. The driver to the airport had to be asked 3 times to turn air-con on. Once arrived, sniggered with a bag carry person who was standing there (whilst looking at us) and then had the hide to hint for a tip from my husband. My husband was less then impressed as was I. ", "Lastly, as I have mentioned, a new General Manager apparently started the day before we left. He asked my husband for his experiences and we openly told him a few of them. He seems like a very good man who is switched on and will change things. He was shocked by a few of the things we said and he said that it is his priority to make things better. I really hope he is successful in doing this. ", "But, it is my right to honestly describe our experiences with this hotel, as, it ruined our 'living' part of our holiday. As soon as we left on our moped every day, we were happy. As soon as we returned, vibe straight back from the moment you pull up and the staring, awkwardness begins.", "You get what you pay for I guess??\n", "\nFabulous room!", "Very clean, lots of space and the bed was extremely comfy!", "I thought it was good value especially with the private pool.", "However the service was a huge let down -", "* No maps/information for us on arrival or when requested", "* No cocktail service at night time", "* Served warm drinks and when asked for a cold beverage they responded that it has already been opened.", "* A drink took 10-30 minutes to get (the workers were more concerned about what they were looking up on the computer).", "* Very noisy in the morning from the kitchen which had us awake at 530-6am daily", "* We asked the front desk for a wake up call - which never happened.", "Once they sort out the service I think that this hotel would be a great place to stay.\n", "\nStayed at Amaroossa for 2 nights. Room is excellent, big and wide, and very clean. Our stay was perfect until the last day morning around 10 am, there was one room service guy opened our room door with his key. He tried to open once but couldn't make it because we have locked our room with the \"chain\". However we believe he might be able to sneak inside the room. What's worse was he already could not open it once, the door closed and he still tried to open the second time until we shouted him from inside the room then he just ran away. Could you imagine what if we did not tie the \"chain\" to the door?? Anyway, we straightaway called to front desk and complained about this. The front desk girl said maybe the guy has knocked on your door and you didn't hear it so he straightaway opened the door. Apparently we did not hear any knocks on the door at all. This made us have the bad feeling and luckily we checked out on that day. If not we won't have the safe feeling anymore while staying there. And upon our check-out, there was nothing told by the front desk officers about this. We were quite disappointed after what happened.\n", "\nWe got the room based on a Groupon deal from Singapore, the pictures as supplied on Trip Advisor and Agoda were accurate and it seemed like a good deal.", "When we arrived in Bali, the driver who picked us up in the hotel vehicle was friendly and made small talk with us pretty easily.", "When we arrived at the hotel, it was pretty! Clean and pretty straight forward, the lobby was small and it was next to the common pool. It was a nice hotel, quaint with a boutique feel, check-in was painless.", "The room was beautiful and spacious, lined with a lot of purple and even a lounge area. However, upon closer inspection, we realized that there were a few details that were not to satisfaction. The sink was chocked, the private pool area was dirty, the bathtub was dirty too, the bathroom door was stuck and the shower area drainage was chocked too. It was not the ideal vacation starter to encounter these problems within the first 15 minutes of check-in. We got the 'engineering' (maintenance) staff to rectify the problems as well as housekeeping to clean the room once more. We burned about 2 hours waiting on the staff and eventually we got a little impatient and decided to leave for some food. When we got back, spic and span the room was clean and the bathroom was functioning as it should.", "On the second day, we got visited by the staff, I was expecting housekeeping but was met with a slice of chocolate cake instead. The attention to detail even though it meant them spying on my birth date was a very nice touch to the trip. I loved the reception staff as they were the key to our getting around Bali. In terms of suggestions on places to visit and addresses to provide taxi drivers and the booking of taxis.", "Overall, though the trip was a complete joy, there still are details that need to be ironed out, since the hotel is just about a year old. But knowing the hospitality and the extra mile the staff is willing to go, I trust that Amaroossa has not seen its best days yet.", "Keep up the good effort!\n", "\nThe hotel's room is beautiful. The concept of the hotel is minimalist boutique hotel. Some of the staff are trained and friendly, but the others are not. The downside is the location and the privacy. There is no privacy in this hotel. Although you stay in the amaroosa suite or family suite, there is no privacy at all. The sound of the motorcycle on the street are loud and disturb guest. There is a sign in front of your room \" do not disturb\" , but even you choose the sign, the staff laugh in front of your room. So, THERE IS NO PRIVACY AT ALL.\n", "\nFirst impression: a small hotel with good interior. ", "At day 1 we stayed in executive suite which actually the most basic suite they have but the best experience ever while we were staying. Like the cleanliness of the room and everything is mostly perfect except for the noise from the road and no private pool. The breakfast was nice at 1st day (the creamy pasta was devine!)", "Day 2 we moved to amarossa suite on the ground floor which for us was the nightmare. Dirty, bathroom smells weird and the window door to the private pool need extra effort to be closed. The area of private pool also not comfy enough coz you can hear people talking from the restaurant, so we assumed they can hear us also. ", "Day 3 was the worst from all. The electricity off from around 10pm to morning n their genset can't support all room's electricity. So we couldn't sleep until it was on around 9 am the next day. So many complaints but the staffs didn't know how to handle it. For a hotel that I thought has good management, this is so far below expectation. I just can't believe you don't have backup for this kind of problem and you let your guest staying without lamp and ac and without any compensation whatsoever. ", "So hopefully you'll learn your lesson and be better in managing the hotel. ", "For cleaning service on 2nd floor (our first day room), you did a great job! For CS on 1st floor and the management, do better!\n", "\nIn general, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the hotel's interior is excellent! I had stayed on the first floor with the private pool in the month of April 2013.", "The private pool unfortunately was not really clean, with quite alot of bugs and me and my partner did not use it in the end at all. I understand it should be quite challenging logistically to maintain all the private pools at all times but if they want to provide that kind of suite, they will have to come up with something to maintain it. ", "The shower had a funky smell as well. ", "The continental selection for breakfast is too limited, about 70 percent of the buffet spread is local or asian food.", "Somehow throughout our stay there, the TV will malfunction and just have a fuzzy screen at around 6.30pm every day for 3 days for half an hour. On the first day, I did call the reception about it and they said its going under maintenance for about half an hour, i did not call again on subsequent days and just lived with it.", "The location is not the best, and you will definitely need a taxi or driver anywhere you go. I suggest you get the staff to hook you up with a trustworthy driver and they will come up with something to charge per day, it will end up saving you some money instead of calling a taxi everytime.", "The room is spacious with a big tv and its beautiful. We had a free 30 minutes massage that came along with the package we bought at Adi Spa, if i remember right, just 5 minutes drive away. We extended the spa session to an hour with 35 USD for 2 of us and it was a good hour of relaxation so kudos to them for including this spa session.", "Overall, despite a few shortfalls, I am happy with my stay there for the price that I paid for but the issue of the location might prove to be of big concern if you are looking at moving about.\n", "\nFive star room quality with private pool, friendly staffs and services,delicious breakfast and good price. It's a new hotel so everything from exterior to interior looks so fresh. Unfortunately, there is no private beach but the swimming pool is good. The lighting and interior are so romantic.

They decorate it nicely. It has living room, toilet in the living room area, kitchen with sink, microwave and refrigerator, big bed and spacious bathroom with bath-tub and shower area. The bed will give you a good sleep because it's very comfortable. I can't have a good sleep because our room near the street so that I still can hear the vehicles that passing through the hotel.", "The cleanliness of this place is not too good, maybe there are termites in their desks so that we can see and feel the sawdust on the floor.", "The dining area also smoking free, which is I hate the most about this place, people can smoke freely eventhough kids are around. ", "On the coupon they said that we can check out at 3pm but at 12pm they call me and ask me to check out before 1pm because they have high occupancy that time. That is so rude! I know that I bought their voucher through coupon but I still I'm also their hotel guest, they should treat us the same like other guest who pay normal rate.\n", "\nWe were nor pleased at all with this hotel. Don't get me wrong the hotel is beautiful and the rooms luxurious but the staff is not capable. First one of the staff members walked into our room unannounced when just coming out of the shower, electricity did not work half of the time, wifi also didnt work and we were supposed to check out at 3 o clock but were obligated to leave 3 hours early since they were overbooked ( they told us before only 12 rooms were occupied).", "Will not come back here!\n", "\nPrice wise, its fair enough, new hotel and we got promo package. The room and bath room spacious, but cockroach on the bath room wall after enjoying hot bath, not acceptable at any level, there's also few flies in the bath room. They said its due to the rainy season and promised to execute pest control in the morning. but we've waited until 10am the next morning, and nothing. So by 10 am i went to the front desk and asked for another room, the front desk said it will be ready round 2pm, i called 3pm and asked wheter the room is ready or not, they will call me in another 10 minutes.

But so many small things affected the stay. Firstly the rooms are lovely, i stayed on ground floor in a suite with private plunge pool. It's ashame the sun doesn't come for most of the day but at least it was still hot. The room design is excellent, the bed was amazingly comfortable, but the shower terrible. The door/seal was leaking every time i used it so quite dangerous when you get out of the shower onto a wet slippery floor. Bit of a safety risk. Needs fixing. Also, when i arrived i asked if there were 2 bars as i'd read on internet there were. They told me only 1. But 15 minutes before i left i found out there was a rooftop bar...2nd one! I also asked if there was a shower i could use after checkout. My flight was late at night. I was told no. Then again, I found one as I was leaving the hotel! Staff need a lot of training. The front desk were very nice but not hugely helpful or knowledgable for a 4-5 star hotel. Didnt have maps to give to guests, not too helpful with taxis or spa booking. The food was great so i must compliment the chef(s).

Room is huge, equipped with 2 LCD tv. Phone was not working and also some lamps in room, but the technician fixed it once we call the staff. Looks like it was built in hurry coz some of the materials were not set properly, such as a narrow opening in the door to the balcony, water tap was not properly installed, and there are still some paint residue on the floor. Since the hotel is new, those are still acceptable. There is a rooftop bar, good to see the sky at night. The breakfast is ok. We got one complementary dinner and it was really nice. The hotel is not located right in front of a beach, it took about 5-10 mins to reach Nusa Dua beach by motorcycle. Overall it was ok.\n", "\nOn my 2nd night stay on Jan 4th 2013, i urgently need to print out my amendment for my return flight tickets online due to my extension of stay on the island but i'm having difficulties because there are neither computer terminal nor a printer so the night shift staffs volunteered their computer for my usage. Still i could'nt access to my PDF screen, i'm tired plus famished and the night is running late. Suggested by Mr Andrea *Sales Exec i think* for me to return back to my suite for a rest and he assured me he and his team will take care of my needs. 15mins later he came to my suite and produced me my PDF printout of my return flight tickets back to Singapore.

Not much to do in the neighbourhood but if you're happy to go by taxi there are a lot of beautiful beaches just a short ride away. Wifi worked fine, room was clean but the towels were a bit dirty. Maybe you should change them to newer ones because I asked for new ones after finding spots on the ones we first got. But the new ones also had spots. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and will definitely recommend this place for a relaxing holiday.\n", "\nWe were there at this hotel for three nights as part of our honeymoon and we were really amazed by the facilities and staff.

It also is well known among the people so getting to and from is easy. ", "The rooms are well put up and spacious. The view from our room was amazing with pool in foreground and vast forest of red capped villas in background. The lobby and access were good and welcoming.", "The pool itself was great and relaxing and had adjoining facilities for changing. Sitting besides the pool after sun-down was pleasantly relaxing.", "The staff was always eager to help out in best possible manner. They were courteous and understanding to the requirements.", "The only area of improvement that we observed was food for vegetarians. The breakfast could improve with the beans bit uncooked. Also the Indian breakfast option could become a lot better - especially the parathas need to be cooked more. Even for lunches and dinners the options available were very limited and lacked finesse. If only for the food, we would have gladly rated the facility as a Five Star.", "Having said all this we would definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting Nusa Dua.\n", "\ni already stay twice for this hotel and will come back for sure if i visit Bali.", "The room is big and so clean and there's a table and chair inside the room. The bathroom is also big. The breakfast is good but it's choice is the same for the next day.\n", "\nLoved the big bed, polite and helpful staff; the good food and just some peace and quiet. Loved that it was close to other spas and some shopping. 10 minutes walk to the beach which is gorgeous. There are some restaurants by the beach.\n", "\nStayed here for 3 nights at a conference in Nusa Dua. Very affordable rates compared to hotels in the Philippines where we come from. The rooms are modern and spacious, no bathtubs though. The breakfast spread that they offer is comprehensive and complete, definitely value for money. They have a very nice pool as well. Would like to come back with my family, my kids would love their pool if we had come with them.\n", "\nNice beautiful rooms with Tea n coffee, toiletries available also. Very very friendly staff, always smiling and greeting me. Breakfast was also good by the poolside. The walk to the beach was a little over 10 mins but that was ok for me.I had the standard room with a balcony.\n", "\nWe stay here for a convention at Nusa Dua Convention Centre which is very near to the hotel. Hotel location is good as it's the beginning of the street for street shopping and it's also about 3-5mins to The Collection by taxi. Laundry, spa, convenient shops, western and local food restaurant are just opposite the hotel walking distance.", "Hotel staff were very nice and friendly with good service. However we spots some ants in the room and Air con water leaks at the 2nd night of stay although the technician is patient to fixed for few times. At last they manage to change a room for us. Room facing street is quite noisy. ", "Overall, a very pleasant stay!", "*there is a small bakso stall at the 1st cross road walking down from hotel to street. The bakso is very very delicious!!! The best I've ever had!\n", "\nWe are often to stay in this hotel. Hotel staff was so friendly to everyone and helpful for the guest. The breakfast is a nice and have special locals menu. They've beach club, beautiful beach with a white sands and blue skies. Shuttle bus free go to the beach and enjoy stayed until afternoon.", "Yummy dinner with a sop buntut, a famous menu. We can looking for special the moon from our balcony, is best moment even we stay in this hotel. We will be come back.\n", "\nthis is my second review of santika siligita,and i dont like it because they never maintain the AC.i wonder if anybody from management ever read my previous review,because no maintenance been done ever since.", "on the other hand,they have amazing pool with warm water,you and family can swim until 21.00 afternoon,and also good breakfast", "this hotel near mengiat beach,which is nice but doesnt have decent shower\n", "\nI have stayed in the hotel for three nights in a suite. The room & bed are clean. The toilet and separate shower are big and it has a living room and sofa. The hotel surrounding is quiet & it's a good place to relax. It's the first time I have stayed at the Santika hotel. The hotel staffs are friendly and helpful. I have applied for the hotel VIP membership card and I have discount when I have my meal at the hotel restaurant and late check-out. The swimming pool is nice but there's a construction going on beside it during this period but we can still use the swimming pool. The breakfast is good with different types of variety of food. There's a special dinner on Wednesday 'Satay night' and there's a local band who sang for us English, Chinese, Japanese, Hokkien etc. songs and they sang well. I think it should be a 4 stars hotel though I have checked the website (it shows 3). There's a hotel bus that will fetch the guests (at interval 12pm, 2pm & 4pm) to the nearby Bali Collection though it will be good to have one or two more bus timing at about 6pm and 8pm for guests who may want to drop by there for dinner. Overall, very good and will return again.\n", "\nI was greeted ever since I arrived the hotel, everyone was so friendly even the safety guards! Pretty good security. The guards check every car needs to be checked before they are allowed to enter the hotel parking area, and main entrance. Staffs were helpful, they helped me out printing some documents for free! Parents, they also provide cradle for your baby if you asked them. ", "If you're a cultural person, make sure you experience Bali's Nyepi day/ Silent day. NO LIGHT NO PHYSYCAL ACTIVITIES NO NOISE/SOUND NO TRAVELING. They will perform rituals by the beach too. Next year's Nyepi day will be on 9th March 2016! Opposite the hotel lies a sculpting and decorative art shop, selling wooden sculptures of devils and gods, you might like it if you are an artsy person. ", "Their breakfast buffet was pretty good, they serve many local foods, make sure you try everything! And some hawker stalls, local restaurants opposite the street and nearby selling Indonesian bakso, and Nasi Campur( I like the one beside the minimart opposite the hotel, good Tempeh! ) taste really good and cheap, you won't find these in any hotels. Gym is a little bit small with only a few stuff inside, but its free. ", "There's a street nearby selling dresses and souvenirs. You can also find some minimarts there in case you need shampoo or medicine. You can take a cab to Bali Collection for food, shopping, supermarket, and massage.

The room was nice, the staffs were helpful. Pleasurable hospitality and I loved the breakfast choices.

Overall it was nice to stay there.\n", "\nDo not get a room at the front of the hotel, the motorbikes scream up the road all hours of the night.i had room 236 and above this room is the water pump for the hotel, sounds like a helicopter is landing it is so loud in the room.Every door in the corridor can be heard opening and closing, I sound like a winger, well try it yourself.", "Apart from that, the breakfast is good and the pool is above average...\n", "\nAlthough this hotel is not actually in the gated Nusa Dua hotel area, it's not far from it. You could walk there if you want, or get a taxi.", "The hotel itself is lovely and generally good value. Rooms are reasonable size, clean and with wifi. Breakfast is fairly wide range, although poached eggs were a long time coming every morning!", "We used to stay at the Santika premiere beach resort in Kuta; if you have stayed thete, be aware that the Nusa Dua Santika does not have the beautiful gardens like at Kuta.", "The only possible downside of this hotel was the swimming pool; large and clean but during the day, the water was so warm as to be uncomfortable.", "Overall, a great place to stay.\n", "\nI used my santika point to stayed 2 nights at this hotel for free. Even Me and my wife stayed with free voucher, they give us first class service. Their staff are friendly, they upgrade our room to be deluxe pool room view. It was awesome.

Local cafe, restaurants, shops just out side the hotel.", "The breakfast are wonderful, especially the local dish. The friendly chef go around the guest to serve you their best dishes every day.\n", "\nWe have stayed just 1 night in this hotel, but were really satisfied with it. Our room was quite big, and the service was excellent, even we checked-in quite late after the plane. Breakfast options wee good too, the only disappointing thing were flies in the breakfast area (because it's located in the open area), but it's the situation that is almost everywhere. Staff was very friendly too. We enjoyed our time in the pool and met new people from Australia. ", "We also enjoyed the view from our room to the green forest! It was a great experience to rise at cock-crow in the morning! so natural!", "Not to mention the location - it's quite close to the city, where lots of souvenirs shop and restaurants are located.

The 24 hour convenience store is just a few metres from the hotel.", "3. There is a foot massage parlour just in front of the hotel building, and the prices are affordable.", "4. There is a food shop next to the 24 hour convenince store selling Chicken Betutu Rice called \"Warung Ibu Oki\" which I like very much.

The breakfast quality is superb.", "7. Staff are helpful and friendly.", "8. If you need to get some medicines, there is a 24 hour chemist which is located only 10 minutes by taxi.", "9. With the new toll way over the water, it is fairly faster or quicker to get around Bali. We used to be trapped in heavy traffic at Ngurah Rai Bypass road when we stayed in Nusa Dua.", "The minus points:", "1. I had to call the maintenance service twice during our stays because the Air Condition was dripping water. It was due to the fact that I set the fan speed to low, so there were some condensation inside the air cond that caused the leaking. It wasn't a big deal thou, because it only took less than 10 minutes to clear out the water. If you stay in this hotel, you must set the fan speed to high to prevent the condensation inside the air cond.", "2. A staff had forgotten to call a taxi for me one afternoon which left me waiting for half an hour. When I returned to the reception to check, the staff whom I had spoken to, had gone for the day.

On our arrival date, we were informed that our room wasnt available and had to stay in another one with twin beds in the first night instead which was quite annoying. Moreover, the rooms' furniture is a bit worn out and the rooms could be cleaner.", "Besides, the view from the room is not really good because even the pool-side does not look very nice!", "Unfortunately, the \"fitness-center\" is not worth calling it one: there are only two type of cardio-gadgets which are quite old and really suck.\n", "\nFor the money, this hotel is Excellent. We stayed there for 6 nights and then moved to another budget hotel near by, which was a big mistake. We should have stayed at Santika. I now know that other budget hotels in Nusa Dua are not Nearly as good in terms of breakfast, cleanliness of rooms, and service.", "PRO:", "Close to the beach - it is only 5 min walk. Do not listen to reviewers who say it is a 20 min walk, it is at most 5 min and the walk is fun (you will pass local shops and then enter through a huge whimsical gate, which will lead you to the beach)", "Breakfast is Excellent - tons of Indonesian options that are very tasty and there is a huge Continental/European food selection as well. Breakfast area has a view of the pool, which is nice. They bring tea/coffee to your table (now we know other small hotels do not do it - it is usually all self-service).", "Staff is Friendly and helpful - the staff is very helpful, especially as compared to other budget hotels. Akay (spelling?) at the front desk is a very nice young lady that will help you in any way she can.", "Rooms are very clean and new - beds are very comfortable with goose-down pillows(!!!) - exceptionally good for a budge hotel. Air-conditioning runs even while you are gone, so you come back to a nicely cool room (I usually don't like air-conditioning but in Bali you will use it).", "We were offered a free upgrade to a larger suite, which was huge and beatiful and quiet.", "CONS:", "Some towels have spots - it is a budge hotel, so something has to give. They keep using towels that simply need to be replaced. I would suggest to the management to save money by turning air-conditioning off while the guests are out of their rooms and use the savings to replace towels more often. Nothing makes you cringe as an impression of uncleanliness in a hotel.", "The drivers they recommend are Not very pleasant. We asked concierge to book us 2 day-trips. Both times the drivers were trying to take us home before it was time. The drivers were not rude per se but it was uncomfortable to keep reminding them that we contracted with them to do X number of activities and keep asking them to keep their end of the agreement. This hotel needs to understand that while the drivers do not work for them, if they recommend them then the customers will associate their experience with the hotel.", "On the day of your check-out, the bell-boy who calls you taxi will treat you like you no longer matter. We asked for a taxi and he asked if we called it, we said \"No\" and he just stared at us instead of calling the cab...Then he finally said he will call the cab and 20 minutes later still no taxi. We asked again and Again he asked if We called the cab (?!). So we left with a very disappointing last day impression.", "The area near the hotel is a bit ... local-looking. The drive up to the hotel is not grand. This is the only thing that will remind you every day that you are staying at a budget hotel. But this was very minor and I actually liked waking up to the sound of the roosters - it is very soothing.

The staff are helpful and greet when meeting people. Room is standard, but thanks to the additional balcony to each room which make it roomier. Toilet amenities are provided, as well as rain shower with high pressure. The swimming pool is enough, not too big and not too small. A small fitness center room is just next to the pool. Breakfast is something can be improved in terms of taste.", "Parking lot is so limited inside the hotel. Overall, I found it nice to stay at Santika Siligita, as it is also close to nice beaches and nusadua area. Wifi is free from any area inside the hotel.\n", "\nStayed here for 1 night.

Since I've visited Nusa Dua for business, I chose a hotel to stay that I've known very well, Santika. This is the first time I visited Santika Siligita. It was located a little bit far from Airport, 30-45 minutes. I went there by a car whom drove by a friend of mine, so I don't know how to reach this place if I don't have a friend, maybe you can take taxi from the Airport. The first time I recognized from this hotel is the interior is so-Santika. The staffs were very warm and helpful. I remembered a guy in the receptionist desk, named Adi (if I correct). He's very handsome, and very helpful. I thank him so much. The restaurant is located right in front of the swimming pool. For some people, this is not a good position, but for me, it is not a big deal, I still can enjoy the food. I totally recommend this hotel to they who are in a visit to Nusa Dua. Wanna come back next time? Definitely yes.\n", "\nIt's good and comfy with the rooms being clean and employees being very friendly. Access to beach isn't that far, a 15 minutes walk would get you to the nearest beach. Great number of nearby restaurants, beer gardens, bars and convenient stores around you bet you won't starve. Activities offered, however, appears to be lacking. The gym is tiny with only four equipments, the simple rectangular pool only goes up to 1.4 meters with a stretch of shallow platform to lay in the water. The vicinity appears to be pretty small, too. Breakfast appears to include quite a lot of leftover of dinner from the night before and doesn't taste that great (1.8/5 I would give). The overall experience is good and all if you have your own plan of activities and tour, don't expect a whole lot to do in the hotel itself.\n", "\nThe room is rather too small than I expected. The shower is nice though. Breakfast is average, should do a daily menu rotation, my suggestion. Staff is okay, pleasant. If you love everything around the corner (shopping, food, beach) this is not the place. Taxi is too expensive in Bali & taking bus is out of question.

Hotel Santika was within my budget and very affordable. I had a lovely room here the night I booked in, however it was a little noisy so they moved me the next night to a room with pool views on the 3rd floor. Nothing is too hard for the staff here. They are the most friendly and obliging people I have come across. Being greeted by a smile everyday and happy faces is just great and very refreshing. As an Australian, I do think we have a lot to learn from these people!! They may be a little hard to understand but remember we have come to their country so we need to expect some difficulties, I can't speak any Indonesian yet they try hard with their English! Everything is clean here, especially the rooms which is important. I stayed for a while and my room was cleaned everyday even when I told them it doesn't need to be. The bed is the most comfortable bed I have slept in and the linen is to die for, and I'm pretty fussy!!! I want to take the pillow home with me!! ", "There is a lovely decent size pool, a gym (2treadmills and 2 bikes) and a day spa for those that need some pampering. I had 2 massages and although it is a little more expensive here $15 or more, it is definitely worth it. I did not find the location a problem as I like walking and getting out and about. The beach is only 20 minutes walk or if you hire a bicycle like me, it's 5 minutes down the road. I liked not being surrounded by hundreds of shops and markets or hustle and bustle. This area is certainly quieter and more laid back which is nice I think. There are supermarkets and restaurants 5 minutes walk down the road as the restaurant can get a little expensive with the 21% tax added on. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying in Nusa Dua on a budget.\n", "\nFor the price we paid we are very happy with our hotel choice. I have to admit that it is 45 mins app away from Kuta which is kind of where you need to go if you are looking for things a lot cheaper like shopping or cheaper meals from well known chain companies.

Easy fix though as we just got some bottled water from the little service station looking place from down the road.

Not a problem at all, however once I got into my room it was a little underwhelming. It was very small, so I would have hated to of seen the room I would have received had I not gotten upgraded! Also whilst the sheets and room generally were very clean, I noticed there is a pretty big bloodstain on the mattress protector. I am going to keep telling myself that someone must of had a nosebleed in the room... It strikes me that something such as a protector could be quite easily replaced, as opposed to just leaving it there with a pretty big bloodstain in the middle for guests to see.", "The biggest negative for me with this hotel is the payment processes for the restaurant and general facilities. It seems the hotel should be encouraging guests to spend as much money in the hotel as possible, however they operate a system whereby you are not allowed to charge things to your room and then pay when you checkout at the end of your stay. Instead you must either pay cash or put a 'deposit' down which anything you buy is then deducted from. ", "This may be a normal way of paying for food and drink in some hotels, I don't know, but I certainly haven't come across it before. The beauty of my previous hotel in Seminyak was that we could spend a whole afternoon by the pool and charge everything to the room with no stress. The Santika's system of pay as you go I just find insulting. It is as if they don't trust their guests to pay their bill at the end of their stay. When I mentioned this to a member of their staff he looked as if it is something they hear a lot and he was just a bit embarrassed. I didn't take it out on him as this is clearly a management issue.", "We decided we would just buy a few beers from the shop across the road and then drink them by the pool instead of buying them from the restaurant out of principle. However when we tried to drink them poolside we were told that it was against hotel policy for guests to consume outside food and drink in the pool area. This I understand and frankly I thought we were pushing our luck, so we went elsewhere. However when we came back later, there were a number of guests from the louder parties staying at the hotel who were openly drinking from drinks they were pulling out of plastic bags. On top of this they were doing this well past 11pm when we had been moved on the night before at 9pm when the pool officially closed. ", "When we asked why these people were allowed to drink their own drinks and to do it beyond the official closing time of the pool we were given the lame excuse of 'water treatment' and no one would explain further. Clearly this is a case of, if you are inclined to act however you want and openly ignore the rules the staff tell you then you will be allowed to get away with it. ", "The sight I saw which most annoyed was of a couple who had set up wine and glasses (even a bloody candle in a glass vase for ambience) at the side of the pool so they could drink whilst in the pool. With the number of children running around and splashing in the pool, in addition to the fact it's dark because they are well beyond the official pool closing time it would not have taken much for some of that glass to get broken and end up in the pool. Worst case scenario, someone could have got hurt, and even if they didn't the whole pool would have had to be drained to remove the glass from the pool. All of this because one couple were allowed to indulge themselves at everyone else's risk and the staff only seem to enforce the rules on some guests and not others.

The street looks run down but is home to lots of low priced stores where you can practice bartering skills.

Can't see why one would spend on the fancy hotel when your going to spending mist of the day on the beach.\n", "\nGreat value for money if you book via Agoda. I paid about USD40-50 per night.

I might add they were much stronger than mine but I managed. Thank you to all staff at Santika for their kindness.\n", "\nMy girlfriend and I stayed here for 2days and 2nights. We chose to stay here because Nusa Dua has a quiet environment. If you're looking for a night life then Seminyak is best for you. The hotel is quite far from the beach. You have to walk 10-15 mins to get there. Majority of food establishments in front of the hotel offer Indo food. No other restos can be seen outside and a limited store outlets, too. I'm impressed by how staff treat customers very well. They responded to queries immediately and wasted no time in giving customers great satisfaction. Breakfast was nice. There was a good variety of food from local to western types. The downside though was the bed linen which was awful when we got inside. The following day we requested to have it changed only to find out it still stinked. We will surely get back here if given the chance.

I have seen road signs to Geger beach but I am not too sure on exactly how close the beach is since I did not go. I took a taxi to Seminyak to see my friend and took me about 40 minutes! I found easy access to taxis most of the time, however.", "The hotel is a very modern building with many open spaces therefore it is quite airy. The staffs were friendly and check in was smooth and fast. The room was large, modern and comfortable. The shower pressure was very good and they had good amenities provided (incl hair dryer). The only complain I had was the slowness of the service (I requested for clothes steaming which they do have but did not deliver at all, I had to call twice for them to deliver shampoo to my room). The breakfast was nothing short of excellent, with Balinese food, egg station, fruit bar etc. The swimming pool looks nice (not too big) - I did not have the time to try but it looked quite inviting.\n", "\nWhen visiting Bali you can opt for the beach scene or do the cultural route. I chose the latter and so booked my stay at the Santika Sirigita Hotel. I arranged to be picked up by them at the airport, which was a good move as my flight arrived at night and the airport is about 1/2 hour or more away from the hotel. Check in was warm and friendly. The staff working at reception are all very pleasant and friendly, and can answer any questions you can think of. My room overlooking the pool was large, comfortable, and relaxing. I chose to have dinner that night in the hotel, and the restaurant manager, Gusti,, made sure I was well taken care of every night thereafter. The restaurant is excellent, serving a wide variety of food, but of course the Balinese fare on hand is the best choice. The breakfast buffet the next morning was also excellent. They have a special Balinese table which is a nice change. I booked several tours and never did make it to a beach while on Bali, and honestly did not miss one because the pool is big and beautiful, and also open until 9pm. After a day of sightseeing and traveling all over Bali as well as neighboring Lombok, the pool and restaurant were all I needed to unwind. Everyone working here is helpful and pleasant without being obtrusive. As I was traveling alone, they would always make a point of saying hello and everyone seemed to know my name, which I thought was very nice. Towards the end of my stay they even started referring to me as 'Bapak', which I took for the great compliment it is, It was very hard to leave this comfortable beautiful hotel. I hope I can return.\n", "\nThere are 2 things of service is given by this hotel such as people and price, very warmly welcome by the staff when you check in or breakfast time. value of room price with the hotel facilities and service is equal.

Please be careful with guests who love to have a walk at night. As our habit in Austria, we love to have a stroll around at night time, but apparently the surrounding of Santika Siligita is full of stray dogs, they fight mostly at night time (our room was in front of the Pintas Siligita street) and it was very loud. I hope the government do something about these poor dogs. Very scary because maybe some of them have rabies or something!\n", "\nThis hotel is located about 1km from the beach in Nusa Dua - not a real drawback since the hotel itself is rather pleasant and convenient. The rooms are clean and large, best choose the deluxe rooms on the pool side if you want to avoid the traffic noise. The pool is good for real swimming and the restaurant is nothing fancy but quite nice and grounded. The most striking feature of the place is the hotel staff - genuinely friendly, positive and charming! As other reviewers mentioned, the lack of carpets in the hallways and corridors makes it a bit noisy if you spend a lot of time in your room. If you are sensitive to noise bring some earplugs and it will work.\n", "\nSo nice to come back and be recognized by reception staff been a few months since I last stayed.

A pretty new hotel and very clean. It has many employees or ppl working for the hotel that makes it very professional and efficient. Always smiling. Breakfast buffet have good spread of food and changed everyday. Its location is very convenient with many restaurants to choose from, near the stretch of gifts shops leading to the nusa dua beach about 10 to 15min walk. We had tried the ibu oki just opposite the hotel, ulam restaurant. Food price are reasonable for the standard of food served. We also attended a church service just about 5 min taxi drive away. We esp like the free sun lounges at the nusa dua beach, the ppl there maintaining the lounges were very friendly and attentive to customers needs. Free shuttle to the beach. Where can we possibly have beachfront sun lounges for a 3 star hotel? Sharing the same stretch of beach with those 5 stars? If really have to fault, I think the gym should improve with some weights to make it complete. Highly recommended!\n", "\nFairy new hotel, recently we move into this hotel for 4 days stay.

The rooms are a little noisey as mentioned by other reviewers, the doors are very heavy and solid and there is no way possible to close them quietly. We had a deluxe pool view room and it was great for the price we paid.

This gesture was such a good way to reach out to their long-staying guests, and certainly something I appreciated very much :)", "The best thing about the Santika is that it is just a 10-minute walk away from the beach, the tourist souvenir stalls (there's a whole row of them lining both sides of the street going to the beach) and interesting restaurants/eateries. You'll never run out of things to do, because of its great location.", "All in all, the Santika Nusa Dua is a wonderful place to stay in if you need to do business while enjoying a few simple pleasures in a clean, safe, and friendly environment.\n", "\nHOW/WHY/LOCATION:", "Stayed here because of a wedding event nearby and I must say this hotel is right where it needs to be for wedding events because it is very close to the Puja Mandala Religious Harmony Complex where you will find a Catholic church, Protestant church, Mosque and Temple in one location AND is close to big name resorts like the St.Regis and Novotel Hotel nearby.", "There are two major beaches just 5-10mins drive away, Pantai Mengiat and Pantai Geger (close to the garish and overly-commercially concrete Mulia Resort). The famous Ulam Restaurant and smaller restaurants are also close by with the equally famous but much smaller Nasi Ayam Ibu Oki looking to open a branch right across from the hotel!", "DESIGN:", "We thought that the hotel was designed well by being simple, modern and yet still having tropical and natural design elements. This was seen right from the reception area through to the pool/restaurant areas and also the rooms with elements of stone and wood throughout. Quality furnishings in the room, Large LCD TV, simple fridge with excellent pillows (King Koil?) and bed sheets. The bathroom amenities and boxes/places provided in the bathroom was above average and the rain shower I think is simple and effective. One must remember to switch between rain shower and tap however if you'd rather not get your hair wet.", "STAY and STAFF:", "The stay? If you can it is NOT RECOMMENDED to get any rooms facing the road directly. There are a number of rooms that aren't as close to the road view and what are termed as being 'garden' views and these are perhaps second only to the rooms facing the pool. The noise level at night was unbearable for both wife and kids.", "However the staff were very helpful throughout when we requested our rooms to be changed, which we managed to do for our second night and had a good blissful nights rest!", "SUMMARY:", "A very decent hotel in a what is also a decent location at a price that is almost unmatched anywhere near this hotel with its bevy of places to eat at, see and visit! Well done Santika.\n", "\nI don't usually stay in Nusa dua area, this time I was booked Santika Nusa dua by my cousin for his wedding.

Very understanding & sincere. I didn't have any luck that night (and had only 1 hour deep sleep in total the whole night), the next day they moved me to a different room. Great!

Good selection & taste pretty good.", "Overall, this place is a beautiful clean hotel, the staff are great!\n", "\nMy business took me to a 5 night stay in this hotel in which I found a bit placid. The design and lighting are typical shiny bright city hotel, which should not be the case since a Balinese setting should set you in a relaxed mood. I personally would prefer a dimmer lighting to the building especially the lobby area. The reflection pools are not fully filled, exposing the pumps and spouts of the water feature", "Upon entering the room the first thing you notice is the lack of warmth in the design and the sand blasted glass wall of the bathroom which provide a silhouette of anybody bathing inside the bathroom. This could get a bit uncomfortable in a twin sharing basis. Wi-fi is available for free in all rooms to the delight of those 24/7 wired community", "You should bring your own snacks if you are a snack person since the room only provide empty fridge and proper small provision stores are quite a walking distance away. Room service is dependable as with other Santika hotels, albeit a standard taste", "Look for small numbered rooms since they are on the open wing part of the building and offer better views than the big numbered ones. Also take note on big numbered rooms since some of them are facing the walls of the building shafts. Safe bets are rooms numbered 01 - 15 since they are esat facing and offer a great sunrise view and ray", "Business center is non existent, but the staff try their most to accomodate you", "Forget the early surf catching and sea swim here, since the hotel is a good 1 Km away from the nearest beach. They do offer a pool and also a shuttle service to their beach club, though.", "All and all, this is a hotel best suited for those looking for an affordable accommodation for attending events in the posh area of Nusa Dua, leaving early in the morning and returning late at night to crash. The rooms are certainly not a place you can relax in , and having only one coffee shop/restaurant and a pool would certainly leave you with a lot to be desired if you were to spend any lounging at the hotel.\n", "\nThis hotel has only been open about three months. The rooms are a reasonable size and are nicely furnished and modern. They have a mini fridge desk and tv, but lack sufficient shelving/draws for clothes. This didn't bother me too much as I was on my own but if there were two people in a room it would get difficult. The staff are delightful, always friendly and smiling. The restaurant is cheap and good, safe food, tasty and decent variety. Breakfast buffet has a good range of options. The pool is fantastic - absolutely blissful. The masseurs are the best I have ever been to, and I get a massage on a fortnightly basis back in Aus! They are highly professional and consistently good. The price is also perfect. My only complaint is that the rooms arent very soundproof so traffic noise can wake you up and the sound of lifts pinging or doorbells ringing can be a little disruptive. Pack earplugs and you will be fine! Excellent value for money and a great place to stay if you are here for business or sport etc and out and about and not in need of the resort experience.\n", "\nInteresting hotel with rooms set around a beautiful swimming pool - very good deluxe room with large separate bath and shower - free bottled water and tea and coffee replenished daily.", "When I was there 80% of the guests were a Chinese group who disappeared daily which meant the whole complex had a Marie Celeste feel to it and the restaurant was empty most evenings.", "Excellent large and varied breakfast - good evening food at a very reasonable price and the specials were always interesting.", "The hotel itself is rather isolated but the free shuttle to the beach and the Bali Collection was helpful and taxis are cheap.", "All the staff were OUTSTANDING - too many to mention but thank you to them all!\n", "\nThis hotel is a lot cheaper than surrounding hotels like The Bale, St Regis and Mulia.

Staff was friendly as they are always in Bali.\n", "\nWe love this place since we got there, the pool and garden was fantastic mostly the architecture design for this place is top notch, but sorry to say but the building quality is not good enough. Specially the finishing quality of the bathroom, we stay in room 161 the shower floor gather lot of water and not slope enough to flow it through gutter, and I guess the shaft structure part that hold all the utility might be leaking cause we can smell the odor. It's really make the bathroom unpleasant. Hopefully the hotel operator can fix this up and pay attention to building quality and housekeeping, definitely we're gonna come back there cause mostly we love the place.\n", "\nthat will be my first choice in Bali, the price is cheap and the room is cozy and beautiful, they got the best balcony outside the room. and free shuttle to bali collection and the beach. and the most important of all the staffs are hospitable and lovely!!!!!thanks to them, I love Bali so much\n", "\nWe booked a suite 102 sq mtrs ,the staff were fantastic could not do enough for us food was reasonably priced and good,the pool area was fantastic but the water was a little on the cold side,invigorating LOL.", "The three room suite was as good as i have staid in anywhere in the world.", "It is a AUD3 cab ride to the beach and shopping but compared to the prices at beach side properties we consider the cost of a cab a minor cost for the luxury we had.", "We highly recommend this property and will be going back later this year.\n", "\nRooms are large and well fitted.

So many areas including western and indonesian. This was by the far the largest choice we had during our stay in Bali. ", "9. The beach is stunning and very close by. The hotel offer a free shuttle which was great as we went to this hotel during low season and it was always available. ", "10. Close to the bali collection, again the hotel offer a free shuttle. ", " Points to consider:", "1. The bathroom was not cleaned as well as I would've liked, and the drains did produce a smell after using the shower. ", "2. You have to get a shuttle just to go to the beach and from previous reviews I understand this can be a pain during high season as this is a very large hotel but taxi's are cheap. ", "3. If your really are insistent on a full English even though you've travelled 16 hours+ to get away from the UK just ask the staff, don't leave a bad review!", "4. Hotel food is a little more expensive than at the beach which do GREAT food and it's cheap. Some restaurants at the Bali collection are cheaper too. ", "5. The drivers will try and sell you trips and visits to restaurants. This can be irritating. Do use trip advisor to look this up before hand. One time a driver offered to book a local restaurant for us which he really recommended. We quickly turned it down when we read the past 10 reviews which were extremely negative and included food poisoning! Fortunately the hotel have excellent wi-fi to do this, ", "Overall this is a very nice hotel with good facilities. It was perfect to spend a few days getting used to the heat and relaxing on a stunning beach and whilst there are plenty of excursions you can do from here, staying at other places around Bali allows you to see much more of the culture.\n", "\nWe went to Bali on April 25, 2014 and stayed what it used to be called Mantra hotel for 10 days. We had a 33 hr flight and were so tired but once we arrived in Bali we forgot about all of our exhaustion. The hotel was an amazing value and it was very nice. Staff was the friendliest in the world (but so were all Balinese people). Breakfast was included and it was delicious. The bhotel wasn't on the beach but it was pretty close. Get a taxi for 2.50$ US and you will be in nusa dua/ geger beach in no time . ", "The hotel is very close to Geger temple. It's worth checking it out. Once you are on the beach drink lots of coconut juice and try the beach restaurant. They offer free WiFi too. Mulia hotel is a few steps away BTW. ", "Once we were in Bali we wanted to explore so much, I highly recommend seeing a Balinese dance, dine at the Jimbaran bay, check out Kuta and Seminyak, dreamland beach , Tanah Lot temple, Goa Gajah, the Monkey Forrest, Kintamani mountain, Uluwatu temple and Bali collection. Hire a driver for the day. They charge 60-70$ and they will take you anywhere. Our drivers name was Baggi. He was the most amazing driver ever. We hired him for 4 days straight. Ask the front desk for him. ", "Also if you are into yoga talk to the front desk. They will arrange for a yoga lesson at the Westin for $5 for one hour. It was a great experience. I loved Bali and can't wait to go back.\n", "\nI moved out of the first room I was placed in because there was mould on the walls and a musty smell permeated throughout. Bad for the health. The next room I got still had mould but not as bad. The drains in the toilet smelt of rotten eggs every time the shower was used. And when the waterfall shower was use water leaked from the roof down one of the walls in the shower. This place needs a lot more attention. I don't think I'll be back unless it gets a revamp. I also won't be recommending the hotel to anyone.", "The pool is beautiful.", "The staff are excellent and make up for the shortcomings of the rooms. They are helpful, kind and friendly. I appreciated the assistance of the bell boys making bookings on my behalf and the service staff at the breakfast buffet going above and beyond to look after guests. As a frequent traveller from Australia I wish hotels in Australia could be as customer orientated as the staff are here. Travelling solo the staff would take time to talk to me and offer advice on places to visit. I really appreciated their warmth and friendliness. They made my stay very pleasant indeed.\n", "\nHaving been spoilt all our life at the Oberoi's, Ritz's, Marriott's and Sheraton's of the world a 4 star hotel in an unknown country was a bit of a gamble. It just happened to be the one recommended as part of a packed tour package we chose, promising us a much truer and complete experience of our destination in the 10 days we had. We spend 6 days in Bali and the PuriNusa Dua did not dissapoint. What it lacks in opulence and grandeur it compensates with charm, natural beauty and attentive pleasing service. Trees, plants, flowers, creepers, waterfall sprinklers makes it an oasis you can retreat to after a day's touring enjoying all Bali has to offer. The rooms are large, clean and the bathroom fit for purpose. No complaints about the bed or pillows either. What could however be improved though is the housekeeping services. Missing toiletteries, towels etc were a bit annoying. ", "A dead spider lay in the bathroom for 3 days. A phone call though sorts most issues in minutes. The restaurent is basic, the breakfast not worth mentioning though it offers a large choice. We tasted a spoonful of the 20 plus dishes our first day then opted for bacon (have to specially request) eggs and fruit the remaining 5 days. I wouldn't recommend dinner either( there are many really good restaurrents around that do authentic local food) unless you miss home food or are really tired and would like to eat in your PJ's. The hotel itself is in a secluded location which means everything is a drive away. There is a free hourly shuttle service ( if you can find seats) to the beach and the town shopping centre. A number of good local restaurrents provide dinner shuttle services too if you decide to have one too many Bintangs. The pool is okay, the spa services average. Overall a good budget place with amazing staff to crash out every night after exploring the truly amazing heritage and culture of the place. My wife and I do recommend the Puri Nusa Dua.\n", "\nBig thank you for your hospitality, dear The Puri Nusa Dua! ", "We stayed in The Puri Nusa Dua for Nyepi package.

The amenities supplies needs to be concern by housekeeping as the do the task daily, for e.g. our salt bath's already runned out but he forgot to give us the new one. Maybe the brand of the mineral water could be change into the better one. Because Viro has a strange taste for sure. The in dining room served quite fast for the food and the taste was also quite good.", "Facilities >> when we went to the gym which is located in the basement, all of the lights in the corridor is off. So we thought it closed. Maybe the lights could be turn on since it is located on the basement although that day was a sunny day but still needs to be lights on. However, The Puri Nusa Dua has such a great long swimming pool which has beautiful fountains underneath the long wonderful wood bridge.", "Rasa Restaurants >> the taste was good. The various menus, we think it need to more added. The service not so bad, but we concern about their hospitality and less of awareness. But we believe to Mr. Rudy and Mr. Dodi that they have the intregity to listen to our complaints and solve the problem immediately.", "Concierge >> they have such a great hospitality to every guest and they understand what we need with our belongings.", "Security >> maybe the need to be tell to have more smile and hospitality, also care what we are having to do when we entered Puri Nusa Dua for the first time.", "Front office >> they have a nice hospitality and maybe need more smile to complete it.", "Finally, we would recommend The Puri Nusa Dua to other people, on scale from 1 to 10 is at 8 on definitely yes.\n", "\nbooked a nyepi-package here and its a lovely hotel, super friendly and attentive service, great modern room with a nice view and comfortable balcony, a big pool with a seperate kids pool, delicious indonesian food. perfect value for the money.\n", "\nIf you are looking for a place to stay particularly in Nusa Dua area with a great value of money, this is the place.

We found few wild reefs there. So there is no problem in getting to the beach and out of it. Rooms are simple and tidy. Hotel has enough room for everything, it includes nice pool area with sunbeds. During our stay we did not have any feelings that hotel was fully occupied. There is a restaurant at ground floor, which is offering enjoyable meals. Tomato soup is my favorite. Prices are OK. Not expansive. My recommendation is to include more European oriented meals to breakfast. ", "One of biggest advantages is hotel staff. They are really friendly and helpful.

All we can say about the hotel is that it is underwhelming.", "Check In: There were 3 staff on at reception and they were serving one other customer, it did not occur to them that there are people waiting to be checked in, in fact, they just waited there and we had to ask to be checked in.", "Rooms: They are fine, but poorly maintained. Bathrooms are not cleaned properly with mould around the corners, daybed outside has a stained mattress and there are dust bunnies under the bed! It rained heavily quite a few times and as a result, our door was soaked half way up, and we experienced water leaks in our bedroom. Insects would get in and it gets quite noisy due to the traffic outside. The bed is comfy though.", "Pool: Pool itself is quite nice but again, day bed mattresses are stained and so are the towels, which would take a while to arrive.", "Gym: Definitely one of the worse I've been to as far as hotels are concerned. The equipments are not cleaned regularly, no towels for patrons to use, no entertainment like music or televisions, the room itself was dark and morbid, with no natural lighting.", "Breakfast: Breakfast isn't the worst but also isn't great. They have plenty of decent edible food like croissant and other pastries, an egg station (but they took a while a couple of times and even forgot about our orders twice). The service is quite slow; for example, we went to breakfast this morning but the restaurant was full so we were asked to wait which we did. We then realised that other patrons were being attended to before us so when we went up the second time, they just laughed off the fact that we'd been waiting. Theres also a lack of utensils during breakfast time.", "Service: The staff at this hotel are all really lovely and polite however, the service standard is low - lack of attention to detail, inability to follow up on requests, slow in providing service etc. However, I do not think that this is the fault of the staff but rather lack of training by management. The staff seems to struggle with requests that are even a slight bit out of the ordinary and would only do the absolute minimum they have to. There is also a lack of amenities such as toilets in the general hotel area, there isn't a toilet near the pool and the one next to the restaurant was filthy!", "General hotel surroundings: Its a shame because the hotel itself is really lovely but just not maintained well. Some parts of the hotel appears to be abandoned and looks like something out of a scary movie. There isnt much around the area and the closes thing to hustle and bustle around Nusa Dua is Bali Collection (which the hotel provides free shuttle service, so that's good) but I think if you are looking to stay in the area, best pay a little bit more and choose a hotel that has more to offer so you are happy to stay in the hotel for a large sum of the time you are here. Getting to the likes of Seminyak, Legian and Kuta is a real hassle as it takes a good 1-2 hours each way and can be quite costly if you are doing it all the time.", "Overall, I wouldn't come back to stay at this hotel and would be more likely to stay around the Seminyak area where you can find peace but also not be far away from amenities.

There was also a band on two nights while we were there, which were really good, and we enjoyed listening to them while swimming in the pool. Seriously the most attentive staff ever though - which really gave the hotel the edge. Its location is very convenient too - only a short trip away from Geger Beach, Bali Collection, and the Main Gate in Nusa Dua - or other hotels if you feel like going to check them out (though the prices escalate at the others; the Puri seemed to have reasonable prices comparatively). My only criticism would be that the food is maybe not as great as you can get elsewhere, but for the price, it's hard to find fault with it.

We were lucky to be in a ground floor room with the pool and our \"own\" banana lounges right in front of our door. Our room was excellent - modern, well laid out, with comfortable furnishings and attractive decor. The balcony was great with a huge daybed to relax on. The room was always clean and inviting after a hot day and always well-serviced. The buffet breakfast was a culinary delight with incredible variety which we looked forward to every morning. The staff were warm, friendly and extremely helpful. The restaurant was pleasant with good variety of different foods, although serves were quite small for the price. The spa was a bit too expensive for a 4 star hotel but it is your choice as to whether you use it. We went down to the local shops for a cheap balinese massage at approximately 15% of the Puri's price. There was a handy shuttle to the beach, the only downside being that their \"private\" beach with \"your own\" banana lounge and cafe turned out to be Geger public beach, where you had to pay for a banana lounge and anything else you wanted. The beach itself is a bit of a let-down with boats, rocks, coral and litter in the water. However, the Puri Nusa Dua management were apologetic explaining that an agreement with the locals had broken down and they no longer had a private beach. The other thing to note is that you are a fair way from the local shops and restaurants and may need to take a taxi or there is a shopping centre shuttle that calls in every hour. Overall, we had a great stay, made the most of the pool and were quite happy. As long as you are not too focused on the beach, this is a good hotel to relax at.\n", "\nWorst mistake ever booking this hotel. Felt like I was going to be mugged. Staff couldn't speak good English, mould in the shower and bugs all over the bed and mouldy fruit left for us on our desk. Booked for 9 nights left after the 1st. Complained and didn't even get an apology or refund. I wouldn't ever book this hotel again and urge to rethink if you are considering it. Breakfast buffet boring with not much variety. Pool dirty and place smells like fish. Never coming back again.\n", "\nI stayed here for 2 nights for a conference. The location is easy to find. It's right across the humungous Mulia hotel. With the new toll road, it takes 20-30 minutes from the airport.", "Albeit its relatively small size, the hotel is well designed. The room is large and clean. The swimming pool is big and uniquely designed. In the middle of it, there is a circular void looking down at the basement floor. It looks like a vortex. Really cool. The gym is small but has adequate equipment. Compared to many hotels of similar star / price range I had stayed in, this is much better. Breakfast is good. Plenty of choices. But what I like most about the hotel is the staff. They are very courteous, friendly and helpful.\n", "\nStayed 5 nights in this hotel for a friends wedding. Overall it was a nice place, friendly and helpful staff, view was a bit odd considering the land around it was still empty for future construction but other than that it was awesome. They have a very nice pool, rooms were spacious even the bathroom, food was average but I have never expected much from hotels' food. The only disadvantage was building seems to be pretty old, I don't know how long it had been Mantra Hotel before it changed to Puri Nusa Dua. Although it was a bit far from Denpasar, there are plenty of restaurants near the hotel and it is also close to Bali Collection (10-15 mins drive I think, depends on traffic).", "Highlight:", "My friend's wedding was actually at Mulia Hotel which is 5 minutes away. Considering these two hotels are obviously competitors, Puri Nusa Dua's staff were superbly professional about it.", "They even offered shuttle bus services between the two venues. Pretty sure there was some arrangement made with the Hotel but their professionalism helped ensure the event went smooth.\n", "\nThe Puri Nusa Dua is the perfect place to relax and enjoy Nusa Dua. It has an amazing pool, and you can relax on sun chair by the pool while enjoying their happy hours / delicious cocktails. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. The General Manager (Doddi) was a standout. I would like to say thank you for his amazing hospitality. We had a wonderful time at The Puri Nusa Dua.\n", "\nWe are 3 days into a 2 week holiday at the Puri Nusa Dua. Love our room... Very spacious. The staff are so friendly and accommodating and so keen to assist with any guest requirement. Whilst the hotel might not be 5 star rated the staff certainly are. Nothing is too much trouble.

We are absolutely loving it!\n", "\nFirst time staying at the puri nusa dua (formerly the mantra).", "We stayed as a couple for 3 days for a relaxing & luxurious start to our holiday before spending the last 5 days in Kuta. The hotel itself is quiet beautiful with lush foliage everywhere! Very clean, tidy & service was always prompt around pool, bar & restaurant. The rooms are nice & breakfast was \"ok\" for us Australians. ", "Only issue we had by staying at this hotel was the location. Nusa Dua is more of a get away, couples or mature aged destination ( my thoughts only). It's pretty far to get to the main attractions of Bali and the shopping & food is a little more expensive than Kuta. And not a lot to do for someone in there mid twenties. Although we wanted a relaxing start to our holiday, didn't expect to get as bored as we did.", "We enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

Resto menu is very good and price are honest.", "I recommend this hotel for the quality of services.", "Also very near the famous Paragliding Timbis site.", "Enjoy...\n", "\nAs most people say, the room is spacious with a nice balcony where you can hang out and have a drink. The bathroom is also quite large but didnt like the waiy for hot water and the water gets trapped a little in the bathroom.", "Location wise its quite remote. We had to walk 10 mins to a mini mart and the road is not that wide for a pleasant walk. However they have a shuttle almost every hour to get to Geger beach and Bali Collection (which is a tourist shopping mall with branded goods and restaurants). Most restaurants and spas do arrange for pickups from the hotel (we went to Rumah Spa which was rather expensive).", "Staff was really friendly, the swimming pool was huge and the food was decent. Hotel feel was quite grand but didnt like the smell when we got into the room (smells funky)", "Things to do around here was to go to Uluwatu and the Kecak dance, followed by dinner at the popular Jimbaran Bay. Stroll along or relax at Geger beach and go for a massage at one of the many spas there. ", "Best of all...the hotel is very well priced. We paid around RM650 for a 3 night stay. Definitely worth the price.\n", "\nRoom was spacious and clean, staff were very friendly and helpful. Meals were very good. Concerns were no warm water for first 2 days, fairly remote location (needed transport to go anywhere) and early morning phone calls asking if we wanted any tours that day were unwelcome.

The waiters too\n", "\nI spent a short holiday in Bali with my wife and got reference for this hotel from my colleague. My first impression for this hotel was nice, clean, huge pool and quiet. BUT, nothing to expect more with the restaurant. The food prices is expensive. With that price, I expect a tasteful meal. But, my expectation is higher than the price. The taste is not value for the money you pay. FYI, meal price is higher than the 5 stars hotel with more tasteful and beautiful dishes. I doubt to come back again to this hotel.\n", "\nWe were after a relaxing 'sit by the pool' and be pampered. This hotel did not fall short. The included smorgasbord breakfast was great, staff were ever so friendly and engaging (as you come to expect in Bali!), and nothing was too much trouble. The Inhouse spa was awesome, with very professional service. As over Bali, the food wasn't cheap - but that's a hotel for you, and the coffee average, but I cannot rate the facilities high enough. Great!\n", "\nIntro", "We stayed at The Puri Nusa Dua for 4 nights, 2 adults, 2 young kids. The Puri, better known by most taxi drivers as Mantra as it changed the name not too long ago, is a large hotel with 180 rooms divided over 3 floors.

Although we booked just a few hours at forehand. Everything was explained nicely. Perfect English. And serious with some humor. Nice.", "Room", "The room was spacious. Clean. Had a sofa and a bench. Outside was a balcony with a double bed. Big comfortable bed inside. Rain shower. Only the water in the shower didn't drain to well. Our room was close to the main road what made it a little noisy when the sliding doors were open.", "Breakfast", "Included in the price. Perfect bread. All kinds of warm and cold dishes. Enough to choose from. Only hard boiled eggs are a little difficult as two days in a row we had to send the eggs back to the kitchen as they where really soft boiled. Coffee looks like tee. Omelets are perfect.", "Service", "There is a free shuttle to Geger beach every hour not starting earlier than 10 AM. Otherwise you have to wait for an extra hour or take a cab (very cheap). You have to be in time with the transport desk as only the first 7 people can go with the van. We didn\u2019t have a problem getting in. At the desk you'll receive vouchers. We didn't understand why as we didn't show them anywhere. Ones you're in the van the ride is a 5 minutes drive. Arriving at the beach you'll be guided to a 'private part' of the beach where you can use the beach chairs and umbrella for free all day. The beach has sand, water, rocks, a restaurant and that's it. Nothing special. We went only once. That\u2019s probably why the van is not larger as the ambiance at the beach is not attractive.", "The other free shuttle service brings you to the Bali Collection 'mall'. Ok, ehhh, don't expect an American style shopping mall but more or less a average Balinese street without traffic bringing you express supermarkets, restaurants, and some souvenir shops. If you like to shop we definitely advice you to go to Seminyak where at lot of special shops can be found and great food, eg Made's Warung or The Junction, will make your day.", "Pool", "There is a immense swimming pool for all ages. Some waterfall kind of showers can be fun for the kids.", "Conclusion", "After the first impression some maintenance issues came along. It's obvious that the hotel changed ownership and some maintenance work needs to be finished. That close to the sea a building suffers from the natural influences. That shows. The hotel is not at the beach but if you really want to go it's not far. The Puri Nusa Dua is a nice average hotel at a average location at a average spot in Bali. Service is ok. Room is nice. Breakfast is fine.", "Some tips:", "For shopping take a taxi to Seminyak Square (180.000 max) and explore this nice little town, and end up at the KuDeTa beach club chilling.", "Want something special to eat? Go to Jimbaran. Ask the taxi to go and stop in front of the 4 seasons hotel. A lot of food can be found there (on the beach). (Taxi 75.000 max).", "Have something to spend for dinner? Go to the left and find the Sundara restaurant. Wonderful food. Wonderful place.", "You can take the Bali Collection shuttle to get to Nusa Dua beach. That beach is much nicer than Geger and has all the well-known hotels represented, and their facilities. There is a small boulevard to walk along the coastline. Nice.", "We think Nusa Dua is a part of Bali you can find all over the world. It\u2019s not typical Balinese or Indonesian, except you find temples here too. It\u2019s a big hotel zone. If you want to feel nature, don\u2019t go to this south part of Bali.\n", "\nWe stayed in this hotel for 11 nights in August, 2014. We had a lower ground adjoining room that was clean and fresh. We had 3 children under 10 so the ground level was ideal. Buffet breakfast was nice but the same foods everyday so got a bit boring. The pool looked very inviting but it was freezing. Room service was adequate and staff ready and happy to please. The hotel was quite way out which meant cabbing it everytime we wanted to go out. Felt like we spent lots of time in the car. Staff great with our children. Overall, nice hotel just too far away from everything! !\n", "\nStayed here for 3 nights, nice place on the hill. Not really walking distance to anything, but cheap drivers were readily available. For what you pay ($91 p/n w b/fast) its good, needs a bit of maintenance especially in the bathroom but was pretty clean & friendly staff were happy to help you. Pool area was beautiful - wouldn't recommend the room service but other than those few issues it was really lovely.\n", "\nWe chose the Puri Nusa Dua primarily because unlike most other hotels they were able to guarantee us connecting rooms for our family of 2 adults and 2 kids. Our rooms were on the ground floor, right near the pool and the breakfast area, which was nice and easy with young(ish) children.", "For the price, I'd say this hotel is great value. Nice big beds, clean, friendly staff, lovely (if a bit chilly) pool.", "If you're looking for a resort where you spend all of your time, this might not be the place for you. We ate breakfasts at the hotel (which were fine but nothing to write home about) but were happy to go out exploring during the day and for our meals at night.", "We used the shuttle to the beach and to the Bali Collection mall a few times, but mostly just got a cab out the front - a ride to anywhere in Nusa Dua costs $2.50 to $3.00 AUD. We also went to Waterbom in Kuta for a day, which was easy and cheap to organise. ", "Geger Beach where the shuttle takes you to isn't the nicest beach in Nusa Dua, but it's not privately owned at least. The Nusa Dua Beach Grill is near where you get dropped off and it was a lovely spot for drinks and dinner at sunset (and they will drop you back to your hotel from here for free).", "The beaches near resorts like The Bay, the Mulia and the Westin are much nicer, and there's a walking path that goes along.", "I didn't realise how much of an enclave Nusa Dua is and I spent the first few days looking for all the shops, eateries, markets but more or less gave up - to me, it seemed to be a place for resorts and not much else. Which is fine if that's what you're looking for.", "So, the Puri was a nice base for our time in Nusa Dua, not a five-star resort but that's not what we were looking for.\n", "\nOur first trip to Bali and I guess we were lucky to book a good hotel too. We arrived at night after dinner hours and was picked up by the hotel transport on time. Though it is about 45 - 60 mins ride to the hotel but the drive was comfortable, Smooth check -in and our rooms were the basic standard rooms but it was big enough for a family of 2 adult and 2 kids ( 5 and 7) . Hotel facilities were not super luxurious but clean and aesthetically pleasing . The swimming pool is the biggest pool I have seen - the kids had a great time. Buffet breakfast was sufficient to please the belly and the BBQ corn at the poolside was a great afternoon snack to have . There are shuttle busses available to go to Bali Collection for shopping and I highly recommend a visit to Pandawa beach ( a hidden gem ) , though you may have to arrange your own transport and pay an entrance fee but it is worth it. The beach is so quiet , clean , has a natural wave breaker ( calm to canoe and swim ) and natural rockpools for the kids to play . We look forward to our next trip to Bali and will surely stay in Puri Nusa again.\n", "\nMy partner and I stayed in Nusa Dua for five nights. The location wasn't great and the walk into town was around 20mins. I would stay closer next time.

This was great!\n", "\nThe outlook of the hotel is nice & beautiful but when look into details in the room, the workmanship is very poor & you can't imagine this is a hotel standard.

With the children we did find it a bit far away from attractions. Takes approx half an hour into Kuta approximately $11 each way, Two & a half hours from Ubud -$40 return. Any local shopping trip requires a taxi. ", "Rooms were cleaned daily by delightful staff who couldn't do enough for us.

All of them were smiley and very customer orientated. We felt very spoiled during our stay in the hotel. SPA staff and premises were magnificent, excellent massages and the ladies at the spa were very nice and professionals that we loved our frequent visits there.", "The outside of the building and common areas like the pool needs painting urgently, as the current one is peeling-off, it looks like they didn't use water proof painting, so painting those areas would be a huge advantage to the hotel. We were in the hotel for 8 nights, just to sleep there so the looks didn't bother us too much; however, a bit more investment in painting would improve the image of the hotel.", "The shower floors need some finishing on the edges and a bit more dip in the middle so water flows through.", "The food was nice but dinner menu should have more options, I think they only have 3 types of sandwiches. Breakfast buffet had lots of variety and it was delicious.", "As I said, overall, we enjoyed our stay, it was a nice hotel but some improvements will take it to next level. Staff was absolutely beautiful.\n", "\nI wasn't going to write this review but I feel that I needed to let others know that what you see on expedia and other sites is not what you get when you arrive at this so called hotel. We paid bug money to stay here and felt really ripped off. Om goodness we were so disappointed in this place it totally ruined our holiday.

However, there is nothing that can make up for the pest problem in this hotel. We woke up in our room and one of the complementary biscuits in closed pack was nibbled on. We joked about it and thought that they gave us a pack that was already used. The next night we were woken up by the noise of little feet. After we heard something jump on plastic bags, we pointed the light in the direction. When we woke up after a horrible sleep, all the complimentary biscuits were eaten, a packet of our own biscuits was torn and nibbled on and a plastic sunglasses case was also chewed up. We suspect that there was a rodent in the room. The management moved us to another room with what we suspect was a bat. There were nasty noises coming from the upper left corner of the room around sunset. We had to keep the lights on at night. The management arranged complimentary massages for us, but only after we nagged them for days on end. It even went as far as the management promising to arrange a time for us and come and let us know, and them conveniently 'forgetting' to do that. Mosquitoes, nasty smells and overpriced food are only some of the other things that were also wrong with this hotel.

The hotel was tidy and clean, the pool was great (although there could have been more poolside chairs), the breakfast was AMAZING and the hotel facilities were above average. To be honest we didnt eat lunch or dinner at the hotel as it was quite expensive, and the menus weren't huge. The hotel itself is a bit out of the way but there are shuttles running to the Discovery Mall and the beach. We did find ourselves stuck at the beach though when the shuttle didnt arrive for pick up, and there wasnt an explanation for this at the desk. The little things were missing at this hotel - for example, the rooms could do with a DVD player, more bottles of water (we were getting x4bottles per day at our first hotel!), consistent times for housekeeping, etc. We probably wouldnt visit this hotel again if there were other options in the same price range and closer to the heart of Nusa Dua. If you want a place that is quieter and away from the action in Nusa Dua, this would be a great hotel, however we enjoyed the hustle and bustle of Legian and Kuta so the quiet wasn't really for us.\n", "\nStayed there with my family and 5 other families from June 8 to 12.

While the kids played at the pool table, the bartender entertained them and attended to their requests with patience. The fathers were very impressed and grateful. Unfortunately we did no get the name of that staff.", "Lastly, the only disappointment was the free transfers to Geger beach.

On June 11, we had to call the hotel 3 times and they came almost 40 minutes late.", "Overall, our stay was enjoyable.\n", "\nI've just spent a week at the Mantra and the only negative comments I have about it are due to the lack of any acknowledgement from the hotel regarding my wife's 40th Birthday which was the reason for our visit to Bali in the first place. When we first checked into the hotel I mentioned to the staff that we were there to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday and that I wanted it to be special and \"Dewar\" the gentleman who was checking us in said that they would know because they take a copy of your passport and they check your date of birth so I assumed they would at least slip a little congratulatory note or card under the door of our room on the big day, however we had no contact from the management at all.", "On the plus side the resort is good value for money and the general staff that you meet on a day to day basis in the bars, restaurant or maintenance staff etc are all very very friendly and are this hotels biggest asset.\n", "\nI stayed in the hotel for 4 days starting 5th June. We reachsed the hotel and there was a little mis up with the room type we had booked so the manager immidietly upgraded us to the Panorama Suite. The suite was just amazing and the facilities provided in the room were world class. The location of the hotel was ideal for us as we were looking for a relaxing trip and this hotel served the purpose. The hotel has 24 hrs room service, in house spa, gym and anything that you could ask for. It is very near the geger beach and the hotel provide free shuttle to the beach. Towels for the beach and hotel staff is also present at the beach for the guests. We are vegeterains and the hotel would everyday prepare fresh vegeterain breakfat for us and everything they did was with a wonderful Smile. Excellent hotel and wonderful staff.\n", "\nThe room was fabulous. Spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable. ", "The pool area needs a bit of maintenance. There's quite a few leak stains under the bridge goung over the pool. It makes you wonder if the water from the gutter is going to the pool.", "They have a good breakfast buffet. Lots of choices. Just don't order room service late at night, it's not pretty. We had dinner there once, the desert was a disaster. I recommend just eating breakfast there. That's it.\n", "\nStayed at the Mantra Nusa Dua for 7 nights, received an upgrade to a panorama suite which was amazing and very spacious...the bath..WOW ! I was very impressed with the room. There were some drips from the air-conditioning vents on to the tiled floor, but we didn't report it as I could see others have notified staff about it on here already. ", "All staff we encountered were very friendly and accommodating. The cocktail bar staff were lovely. The massage I received in the spa was also fantastic and very relaxing. ", "The only issue was when we used the shuttle to get dropped off in Kuta, we returned to the same spot at 4:50pm to be picked up, along with 4 other people that had been on our bus and waited for 45 mins and the driver did not return to pick us up. We called the hotel and they said he had already left ! So we all ended up getting taxis back to the hotel (which was not very expensive). ", "The breakfast buffet was lovely and we enjoyed it every morning. We had dinner at the hotels restaurant one night and while it was ok, we weren't that impressed and didn't have dinner there again. The local restaurants offer pick up service from the hotel so we took advantage of that. ", "As for the location, it is a bit isolated, but shuttle buses are provided to the lovely Gregor beach and taxis are very affordable. We hired scooters which was more convenient for us to get around. ", "Overall, we had a very relaxing and wonderful stay, which was made extra special by the friendly staff and the upgrade to the fantastic room.\n", "\nOne day (14:00) l asked the staff for blue bird taxi for later that day (15:30). the hotel staff told me they have some other local taxi. but l insist that l take blue bird taxi. The staff says ok. But when l arrive at main gate (15:25), the taxi they got for me is a fake blue bird taxi. (l confirmed with the taxi driver when arriving my destination). The hotel staff treated like a fool and thought l wouldn't notice as long as the taxi run meter. ", "l told the hotel about this situation. And a couple days later the hotel apologized and said the staff misunderstood me. l guess \"No, l want blue bird taxi\" means \"it's ok, any taxi would be fine\" in this hotel~~\n", "\nMy family and I stayed at the Mantra for six days with my grandchildren. Staff were friendly and helpful. We had the breakfast every morning which was very good. Some of the drawbacks are it is not kid friendly, by saying that the only thing for kids is the beautiful pool to enjoy and it is a bit isolated. If you wanted to go shopping or have something to eat outside of the hotel you needed a taxi. Other than that we had a good time.\n", "\nWe were in Mantra Nusa Dua in the beginning of this May so our impressions are fresh enough", "First of all, you should fully understand that where is no any useful infrastructure near hotel. No any shops or other restaurants and it's sad because hotel's restaurant is quite expensive so you can easily spend about $70 for the ordinary dinner.", "Here is the main advise for the Mantra clients: be mobile by renting a bike or car because in this case you will discover the whole Bali island not just the Nusa Dua part and and it's worth it. The hotel also have small parking lot for guests but i think that during high season it has to be full.", "But as a point for staying Mantra is very good. It's a comfortable and cozy place with quite developed hotel's infrastructure which includes organised transportation service at the main POI's of Nusa Dua such as Geger beach (in my point of view it's the best beach in Bali), Bali collection Mall, Discovery Mall, etc... ", "Breakfasts were nice with a good selection of local food and fruits but actually nothing special in comparison with Pullman for instance. ;)", "Room was nice also it's almost new but with traces of bad organised repair and housekeeping i mean few old vine spots on the sofa and bad smell from the toilet sink.", "Nevertheless it wasn't let's say reason for the bad mood 'cause it's usual for the middle price hotels in South East Asia you see what i mean.", "4.5 out of 5.\n", "\nHad a very good feel when we first came through the doors. Service was excellent, very friendly hospitality. Would come back again in the future. ", "Had the best massage with chakra spa down at the basement, fantastic experience overall.\n", "\nStayed 4 nights here in May, we booked a deluxe but were upgraded to the Panorama suite room 301 which is simply amazing, day bed on one balcony, chairs on the other to watch the lights of nusa dua flicker in the twilight overlooking the ocean. Balmy sea breeze just tops it off. The mantra has access to its own beach with sun beds, mantra taxi has a shuttle service to beach and Bali collections regularly. Pool is huge great for swimming laps.", "Very good service, great value for money.\n", "\nWe have just returned from an 8 night stay at this hotel. We were picked up from the airport, with a smile, ( even though it took us over an hour to clear customs)This is a really good hotel for the money that you pay. There is a free shuttle service to take you to the bali collection and the beach. The beach is about a 20 minute walk, but it is down roads which are inhabited by dogs, monkeys and the occasional large lizard or 2, so if you are not keen on wildlife then take the bus. The staff at the hotel are really lovely and the breakfast selection is good. The only negative point is that the exterior of the building is not good, with flaking paint and poor workmanship on show. However for the money paid this hotel provides a really good base , good rooms and pleasant staff.\n", "\nMyself and my girlfriend stayed at this hotel for three nights on the way back from Australia. We could not fault this hotel at all, we had a private pick up and drop off from the Airport. All the staff in the hotel were very accommodating from the moment we checked-in to checking-out. One of our favourite staff was a waiter named 'Sam' from the restaurant. Sam could not made are stayed anymore enjoyable if he tried. Thanks Sam. We had Breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel and could not fault the food all, there was a wide range of food to choose from and no matter what your ordered the food was amazing. Hotel rooms where very comfortable, clean and relaxing as well as the pool and bar areas.. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a relaxing break in Bali. Thanks Mantra for giving us such a awesome break before returning to the UK.\n", "\nI stayed in this hotel only for one night but it was a remarkable stay ! Came to Bali at 10 am, check in time should be at 3 pm but receptionist was very helpful and can accomodate me for a early checkin. While waiting for our room , me and my husband and daughter went to had late breakfast. Restaurant is just in front of the swimming pool which is quite nice and cozy. Mantra also have pick up service to go to discovery mall, private beach club and bali collection which is very helpful from me. Room was very big ( i stayed in superior room the lowest category). They have 2 sofa and private balcony with sundeck . Overall , it is a very good and recommended hotel for family\n", "\nWe stayed here last week for 5 nights celebrating our 18th Anniversary. This hotel is a absolutely a steal deal. If you are looking for best at the very affordable price this is a place to go. We booked deluxe room but upgraded to panoramic view which was absolutely stunning. Obviously there are many cons but when I weigh all that compared to the price I was paying it does make a sense. One thing which makes you forget everything is a wonderfully trained staff. The staff is extremely friendly, helpful, understanding and ready to serve you all the time. They will make you feel very special. Definitely coming back, send me a deal!!\n", "\nwe stayed here last week for 3 nights to attend a wedding in Nusa Dua area. this hotel is ideal for people who will go out most of the day and come back to rest at the end of the day. However, if you love to lounge in the hotel and enjoying the ocean view, this is a big disappointment as :1) they dont have beach access, 2) no Balinese garden, 3) the pool area is a bit boring, 4) the hotel is not sound proof when people swim at night and tend to be loud and noisy. for me personally, a visitor to Bali countless times, access to ocean view, Balinese garden and Balinese ambience is really important that this hotel lacks. But for convenient stay, this hotel meets the requirements.\n", "\nWe stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel look grand and nice from the outside especially with the big pool in the middle. Upon arrival at the lobby, there is only 1 staff there doing the check-in and so we waited for quite awhile to get our check-in done. When we first opened the room door, we are surprised that the room is very big and it is nicely decorated and the toilet look amazing with the bathtub. However, things start to go downhill after 15 minutes. I noticed that the air con is leaking and we immediately called the lobby. They replied that they will send \"someone\" to fix it. We gave up asking them to fix the air con after 2 reminders because the leak was not serious and we just placed a small tower on the floor. FYI the \"someone\" has never appeared for our 2 days stay. After the air con leak, there came another problem. I was shocked when I flipped open the blanket. The bedsheet has large patches of unknown yellowish stain. I was totally disgusted by that. How can the staffs not noticed that when they the bedsheet. Luckily, they came to change the whole set of blanket and bedsheet after we complained. Other than the leak and bedsheet, other things are ok and is definitely value for money with compared to the other high end hotels around nusa dua.\n", "\nI recently stayed at this property for 3 nights. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the wonderful check in staff who were always friendly and helpful. The rooms were beautiful, however, the tiled floors were seriously filthy (not sure they mop!) as with the bath tub and toilet. ", "Food in the restaurant was quite pricey but nice. Breakfast was fantastic.", "A shuttle offered a short trip to the beach and the Bali Collection Centre (higher end shopping centre) as the hotel is rather isolated. ", "Pool is 24hrs and right outside the room.\n", "\nWe stayed there for 2 nights. At first we were welcomed by staff with a welcome drink, which was very nice. Hotel was very well decorated and location was also very nice. ", "Swimming pool was also very well maintained and towels were also provided. There is a bar at the side of swimming pool where you can have your drinks as well as playing pool or dart. ", "Hotel also has its own beach, which is only 3 mins by hotel shuttle or 10 min walking.", "Hotel also provides a shuttle service to most of main areas in Bali. ", "Most of all, staff were soooooo nice and friendly, especially supervisor Dewab(if I spelled it correctly) and manager. Thank you so much for your exceptional service and we will definitely go back there.\n", "\nWe stayed in Mantra in March for 3 nights. Check-in was smooth and welcome drink was served which was refreshing. Room was very big and clean. However, there was a stain on the sofa which was not cleared but it was not like anything troublesome. They actually sent someone to clean it but my kid disable room bell so the person returned and next day I told that I am not bother so need not to worry about that small stain. ", " Sleep quality was good. Balcony of the room was big and good as well. Breakfast was good with lots of choices. However, I did not try any local dish but lots of other things were there. My wife is pure vegetarian and she also found many things to eat in breakfast as well as for kid.", "Pool was large and good. We spent some time relaxing by the pool one night before we left.", "The good thing was that our flight was late in the evening and my brother-in-law also visited to Bali on the day when we were leaving and he stayed in the Mantra as well, Mantra Management allows us to stay till 3 PM. It was nice of them. ", "Checkout was smooth as well. Overall good hotel. Not very luxurious one but surely a 4 Star stay. Would recommend to stay.\n", "\nTravelled for Nyepi day. Came a day before just to check the hotel, we were escorted by Mr. Gede who patiently showing us around for every details, he was more than just helpful, his product knowledge of the hotel is beyond average! He convinced us to finally chosed to stay at this property!", "Also we met Mr. Didi, who friendly welcomed us and continued to served us attentively! By meeting these two, I knew our holiday will be something!", "This hotel has a huge and spacious swimming pool you could ever imagined! Having 9months baby who loves to swim makes this pool perfect.", "Buffet dinner was mediocre but the staff makes the difference, they are attentively serving us with friendly smile, also the bartender Febri was so helpful for our late night cocktail order.", "Booked this hotel hesitantly but ended up with satisfactory! Thank you Karma for making our Silence Day memorable!", "Highly recommended!! You go guys!\n", "\nI took a short break of 5D4N in Mantra with my wife and totally enjoyed our stay there. We had a poolside room that is only a few steps away from the deck chairs ... it is like having our personal pool. The staff there were always very courteous, patient and helpful with all our needs. ", "There is nothing outside the hotel, so if you are looking for bustling nightlife, this is not the place. However, there is a regular shuttle that brings us to Bali Collection, a nearby shopping hub that offers many choices of restaurants, massage services and supermarket for groceries. ", "You can take a short 5 minutes walk to Bay of Bali for beautiful sunsets just outside the Bali Collection ( go through Gate C, then through the Opera Beach Club entrance). There are 2 beach / bays there with very shallow waters and is perfect for lazing around, and more restaurants. Saw many local families enjoying themselves.", "The hotel also provides their free transport to the nearby Geger Beach which is shared among a few hotels and has been rated as one of Bali's most beautiful beaches. ", "Finally, the hotel staff helped us to arrange ( at our request) for taxi to bring us to the Turtle Conservation and Education Centre (TCEC) in Serangan Island. This is the real deal, much better than the other tourist traps and purported \"Turtle Island\" which does not treat the turtles right. ( Tip : you have to give your driver very specific directions to Serangan, else he will bring you to Benoa)", "One suggestion for further improvement : we had a credit of USD40 and a free meal with the tour package, and when we mentioned the deal to service staff, they keep having to check with front desk. Perhaps issuing us coupons upon check-in will make things easier for everyone. ", "Considering that this is the Nusa Dua belt of 5-star luxury hotels , Mantra is affordable and beautiful. We'll recommend this to friends who want a quiet, relaxing holiday.\n", "\nWell what can I say, is hotel was fantastic. We got in after a late flight and the restaurant stayed open and cooked us a meal. The next morning I met Roger and asked if the had vegemite, they didn't but by the next morning there it was. The breakfast staff were great and remember what we were doing that day then the next morning asked how we went. I asked for 2 recipes from the kitchen and they gave them to us. The pool was lovely and you could stand up and touch the bottom. What can I say about the rooms. We were upgraded and although completely happy with the 1st room everything you could have wanted the upgrade was out of this world. Honestly the best hotel stay we have had and I've been to Bali 10 times. We could not fault this hotel in any way. Only myself,husband and another couple went but I would have no hesitation in talking my children with me on the next on.\n", "\nWe booked a room here after our flight was delayed so it was just for 1 night.

", "It's ok for 1 night but not any more. ", "\n", "\nI title my review for the following reason. When ordering a Pina Colada in Bali you would at least expect it to arrive in a coconut with a straw. Instead a small plastic glass of watery something or other arrived. ", "Now, I\u2019m not overly picky however if this resort is going to compete with the other resorts in Nusa Dua it\u2019s going to have to pick up its game on a couple of simple easily fixed items. ", "Visually the resort is nice, simplistic, offers everything you require. If you are after a room with a view make sure you specify this when you book. The room that I stayed in after being convinced to pay for an upgrade via email was looking at a fence. If you are into looking at fences that\u2019s fine, but perhaps maybe let the customer know this before you sell your \u201cdeluxe \u201croom that offers sea views. ", "The rooms on a whole are nice, comfortable and very clean. Satellite TV works well, bed is comfortable. There is nothing provided in the mini bar, so if you require anything you will have to call room service or make a trip to the shops ( it\u2019s quite a fair hike by the way, you will need a cab)", "The staff are lovely as they always are in Bali, they are always helpful. This is where it gets tricky, if you require a drink or something to eat when you are sitting by the pool you may need to take a red flag with you to wave around. The staff takes forever to acknowledge that you are there, and then when they do take your order a watery Pina Colada may take some time to arrive. ", "I write this with the best intentions hoping that you are able to fix the limited essential needs of your average vacationer.\n", "\nWho wouldn't love to hear that you have been upgraded to the suites when you check in! Yes! we did! and it was an amazing facility that we got without a doubt. The detailed interior of the property is true to the spirit of Bali. Amazingly large pool. The hotel staffs are really cordial. ", "The breakfast spread was quite good, however, the pick was the fact that when we asked for \"Halal\" food - the manager himself arranged for a separate platter during the BBQ dinner buffet. great hospitality!", "The only downside is the location. It is too far away from any other place. However the hotel does provide frequent shuttle service to the nearby Geger beach, Shopping mall and even to the Kuta.\n", "\nHaving stayed in many Mantras we found this one to be very average. Staff we're very friendly however language barriers didn't help. There was absolutely nothing in the bar fridge not even milk for the limited amount of tea and the servicing of the rooms daily was also very low standard. The hotel was in need of a makeover.\n", "\n3.5 The room is clean with a very nice balcony.. the bathroom floor has a lot of stains and the ceiling was leaking. The staff in general are nice and friendly. The breakfast buffet has a lot of good food. And a good variety.\n", "\nIt's my first time in Bali and I decided that I wanted to stay in Nusa Dua because it has some of the most gorgeous beaches in Bali (and booked another hotel with my friend in Legian because we will be having surfing lessons). I chose to stay with the Mantra upon seeing the good reviews from Tripadvisor and it is within my budget. It is not a beachfront hotel but they provide free shuttle service to Geger beach and they have a big gorgeous swimming pool to make up for it. I booked a superior room with breakfast for two nights and I also asked them to pick me up from the airport so that I will arrive at the hotel safely because I am travelling solo on my first two days in Bali. Upon arriving at the hotel, I was impressed by the service of their friendly staff plus they speak English very well. That guy at the reception is very nice and accommodating (I think his name is Ori?). They put me on the second floor which offers a nice view of the swimming pool below. I loved my room the moment I stepped inside. It is huge with a king size bed, sofa, fridge, hot shower, in-room safe, toiletries, towels, robes, bedroom slippers, hair dryer, and a balcony. I loved it so much that I wish I stayed longer. The only drawback perhaps is the smell of the bathroom - it has the tendency to smell awful probably some problem with sewage system. Please do look into this matter.", "My favorite meal of the day is breakfast so I am always looking for a hotel that serves delicious breakfast buffet with a wide selection of food. This hotel is just what I hoped for. I enjoyed their breakfast buffet.", "I also had dinner at their restaurant and it was superb! Very delicious fine dining experience. The lady at the restaurant is very nice too.", "Overall, I had a great stay at the Mantra and I would love to stay here again when I come back to Bali.\n", "\nI stayed at the Mantra 4 days ago it's off the beaten track right opposite the newly established Mulai resort which is massive and over the top.", "On arrival we were upgraded to a massive room for an extra $40 it had a great view was clean but we could not manually switch all the room lights off at bed time! Eventually the globes were removed by house keeping which allowed a good nites sleep.", "At breakfast I was disappointed by the offering it did not match the rest of the hotel. I guess it depends on the traveller I don't enjoy drinking tea out of a coffee mug or being served tea in a coffee plunger. This tells you that the people running the place don't care about their customers!", "There was no jam or butter for the pastries unless you accepted the runny home made variety which saved the establishment a few shekels ! The Asian offering consisted of either fried noodles or fried rice which was unappetizing to say the least. We were tired the first nite and stayed in doors for room service was that a mistake! If you look closely at the menu what ever was served at breakfast was replicated on the room service menu. The kids ordered spring rolls they arrived soaking in oil and un cooked ( I guess the deep fryer wasn't turned on ) the hot dog consisted of 2 breakfast sausages squashed into a sweet bun it was disguisting. The fish curry and satays were poorly garnished and were un appealing! Nice place to sleep but don't order anything to eat if you can help it! It's expensive and the executive chef is devoid of ideas and you can tell by reading the menu you'd get a better standard of food at a back backers!!\n", "\nI say nice hotel as this is nothing more or nothing less than average and I feel it's a little over priced for what it is. The pool area is gorgeous and just like the pictures. The rooms could have been cleaner, stains on bathroom floor, and wear and tear showing in the bathroom. The staff were nice a bit of confusion around breakfast times but not a major. Ok place to stay, I'm not sure what else is around the area to compare.\n", "\nWe have never felt the need to review anything before in our lives, but wanted to share how great this place is. We cannot fault a single thing! Everything and everyone is amazing here! 5 star staff experience!\n", "\nWe stayed here recently and in general enjoyed our stay. The hotel is a little way out of Nusa Dua, probably too far to walk unless your really keen. Having said that Taxi's are very cheap and the hotel also provides a free shuttle service to the beach and the Bali collection. The rooms are very big and quite luxurious, particularly given the reasonable price we paid. Another positive was we stayed on the ground floor and we were only a few steps from the swimming pool.", "The buffet breakfast offered a good selection of Asian and Western food. One observation I would make is the standard of the workmanship of the hotel structure is very poor. The hotel is less than 2 years old and there is already evidence of flaking masonry and rusty beams.", "The staff were very friendly and helpful, and we must give a special mention to Wayan who looked after us beautifully during our frequent visits to the Splash/Q bar\n", "\nI stayed at this hotel with my husband and parents. We booked deluxe room but then we upgraded our rooms to suite room with some kind of special arrangements ;-).", "Got to the room and The room was stunning!

Very attentive.", "The view from the suite is fantastic, the suite is huge and clean.", "Swimming pool is very clean and big, quiet most of the time so we can enjoy swimming in a slow pace.", "Daily shuttle bus to the Greger beach, a private beach shared with another 2 hotels. Greger beach is clean and there are two beach front restaraunt that serve very delicious simple food.", "Went to Mulia for dinner at The Cafe, fantastic place, great food, superb service and value for money the entire hotel is super huge and beautiful. ", "Will come back again for Christmas with the family. Throughly enjoy ourself in Nusa Dua a quiet and peaceful place.\n", "\nI believe the mantra made our holiday it was the best place we stayed nothing else compared. We were upgraded on arrival to a deluxe room which was great and we where happy there so we extended our stay for another two nights. We were then upgraded to the Mantra's best suite the panorama suite it had a massive bedroom ,King size bed with its own private balcony which also had a double day bed on it with a huge bathroom a beautifully decorated and clean interior the living area was also more that adequate had another balcony. I can not speak highly enough of the staff or management you couldn't ask for a kinder or more courteous crew. If I go back to Bali I won't stay anywhere but Nusa Dua its easy to travel around Bali from here the locals not bothering you all the time and its cleaner than Kuta or Seminyak .\n", "\nWe got a great deal for $75 a night so I have no complaints! The rooms are immaculate and stunning and rival any 5 star resort in the world. The furniture is new, towels white and fluffy, stunning bathroom and gorgeous pool. The pool is huge and amazing (separate kids pool) and hence not luke warm like most other Bali pools so I loved it, I guess the only disappointing thing was that they had not paid attention to the fact that you were in Bali. We could have been in Queenland or Hawaii - there was no real decorative indication that you were in Bali. The hotel is a bit strange with water moats running around the entire walkways - a nightmare if you had a toddler and such a design would be illegal in the western world. It has a glamorous almost sci fi feel about it (this was exaggerated by the fact that there were only 10 people staying here) with waterfalls, mini moats, a gigantic pool and wet pathways everywhere. There's a shuttle bus (often an open ute thing) to the local shopping centre Bali Collection but the hotel is very isolated, you can't just wander around local restaurants. A few years ago we stayed at The Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa and unless you can get our $75 deal I'd suggest staying there or nearby. At least you can wander around amongst the resorts and chose from 50 restaurants instead of being stuck with one. However staying at this hotel is a very 'personal' experience which is nice. The spa at this hotel is fabulous and spotless and I would recommend many many visits, the staff are very professional and the treatments divine (and much cheaper that other resorts). The food and drinks are ok, nothing amazing but very nice. Meals are about $10 and the the hotel guests are mostly wealthy, polite and laid back. Not sure what it would be like if it was full. Finally if you can't climb stairs don't come here - there are a hundred steep steps from the driveway to the lobby. Lovely place for couples wanting to relax.\n", "\nThe impressive entrance way led to a warm welcome with iced lemon tea. Nothing was too much trouble from the staff who really made this hotel special. The external fabric of the hotel was showing some signs of water damage but the management were addressing this. We planned to stay for 2 nights; we extended to six. Then we returned 10 days later. At the end of our second stay, the restaurant manager set out a special candle-lit table by the pool for us. So thoughtful. The dinner menu is a bit monotonous and it really should be varied on a day-to-day basis. Breakfast is, however, superb, especially their home made brown bread. And the spa..... I can only say that the masseuses do an incredible job at very reasonable prices.\n", "\nStayed 3 nights in March and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and the great staff. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is large enough to have the facilities you need but small enough to have that personal feel.

The suite was beautiful with a breath taking view, we ended up booking another night because we didn't want to leave. The Charka Spa was a delight, clean, beautiful decor and well trained staff,went back the next day for another treatment because I felt so good. Highly recommended!\n", "\nThe hotel was great, from check-in, to room service, the buffet breakfast and the pool bar. The pool was fantastic and the staff were friendly and very helpful.

We'll stay in the deluxe suite next time.\n", "\nAfter some hectic eeeks of travel our stay at The Mantra was the perfect break. The rooms were very large, comfortable and immaculate. The food really was a cut above what we had been used to. The best feature of the hotel had to be the warm remarkably trained staff... the really telling thing was that you werent conscious of their training you just felt you were singled out for special treatment. They seemed genuinly warm and interested. Gary Rosen, the general manager was also very evident and attentive to our needs, even to the point of providing a celebratory cake when it casually came up in conversation that my husbands birthday was the last night of our stay. All round a lovely experience!\n", "\nI stay at the Mantra whenever I go to Bali for the simple reason that you get a four-star experience at a much reduced price over the beachside properties. Stay at the Mantra, then go eat at the big resorts on the beach (the food there is much better and the prices still reasonable).\n", "\nGreat little hotel, a little off the beaten track and doesn't have a lot of facilities but this is really part of its charm. The highlight is definitely the friendly staff who greeted us by name every time! Gary risen (GM) also greeted us almost every day - he should be commended for running the hotel the way a hotel should be run.\n", "\nI would like to recommend Mantra Nusa Dua. What is so great about this hotel is that it is not too big, so after a few days you feel like \"everybody knows your name\", the staff also impressed us by memorizing Our preferences, this made us feel appreciated and special.

The manager went out of his way to send postcards for us, and we also got upgraded to their suit for the last two Nights. The suits are SO Nice With 2 balconies, beautiful interior, and all the luxury one could possible want. ", "We want to thank everyone here for making Our stay so pleasent, if you are looking for something other then just a boring resort filled With old People, you should really check out Mantra, With a Young and dynamic staff, mostly guests age 20-45, superb breakfast, good location, but most importantly a staff that provides the little extra!!\n", "\nWe won 5 nights in a suite at this hotel and are, sadly, just about to check out. The suite was simply furnished but with everything we needed; it was extremely spacious (about 100m2) and very clean. There are two balconies and a large bathroom and the bed was sensational - one of the best hotel beds we've ever encountered!", "Check in was quick and easy, as was getting a late check-out. In fact, everything has been easy, very relaxed and the staff are exceptional. We were made to feel special in the restaurant by Tina & Listia, around the pool & bar by Hendra, by Marie in the Spa, and by Eric during our private romantic rooftop dinner.", "The hotel is compact and extremely well designed, making good use of space. There aren't many facilities (like tennis courts, delis etc) - just the large pool, bar, lounge & restaurant, Spa and meeting rooms. However, it felt intimate and we didn't need anything other than what was here. It was no problem getting into the Nusa Dua \"strip\" by shuttle or an AUD2.5 taxi.", "The food is close to the best casual hotel food that we've ever had - breakfast is a lovely buffet with western, Indonesian and European choices and included in the very, very reasonable tariff.", "The GM, Gary Rosen, wanders around chatting with guests, which is a nice touch. And, the romantic private dinner on the rooftop with our own personal butler was an amazing evening.", "We would definitely stay here again and although not as luxurious as some of the other hotels in this area, the intimacy, fantastic food and service make the Mantra Nusa Dua exceptional value for money and a very, very pleasant place to stay for a quiet, relaxing break.\n", "\nStayed here for my parents second honeymoon, had unpleasant check/in process at the first time. We booked 2 rooms under the same name and requested an interconnecting/side by side room. Unfortunately, when we did the check in around 21.30 our rooms weren't ready. The receptionist didn't realize that we had 2 rooms until I said so. So, I was really disappointing as my parents had to wait for about 20 min in the lobby doing nothing but worried cos we aint going to be next to each other. Finally, the receptionist decided to call Didi the GRM. He tired his best to accommodate us next to each other by forcing the HK supervisor to release the 2nd room asap. Then, about 10 min later our we had out 2nd room. ", "I should give Didi a star for his outstanding service and politeness. Really, he apologized for the inconvenient and he upgraded my parents' room to the suite for the 2nd night. I truly appreciated what he did for service recovery for my parents. At the end of the day, although first impression always count but I still think this hotel could improve their services.\n", "\nI chose this hotel for its price and the fact that Mantra in Australia is reputable. ", "The grounds and pool are beautiful. All staff were very friendly. This place is relaxing, quiet with a wide range of people who stay there. Don't be worried by the 'location' so much, as free shuttles are available and cabs are also cheap. ", "We got a really great deal on this hotel at $72 per night and couldn't be happier with what we got. ", "\n", "\nWarm,friendly,caring staff,amazing choice at breakfast, good choice of evening meals,spent 2 weeks there, it was the most relaxing and pampered holiday we have ever had. Whilst all staff were great,management,namely Gary and Didi, were in attendance daily checking on guests needs and comfort. Hotel has a shuttle to the nearby beach and is in easy reach of shops and other amenities. We,re in our 60's from the UK. and feel that this hotel will suit all ages.", "Sue&Bill\n", "\nWe recently spent 5 days at the Mantra. Most Wonderful staff ever. Beautiful Pool. Great restaurant. The room was clean, bed comfortable, bathroom immaculate. We will go back the next time we want to spoil ourselves\n", "\nGreat! Value for money, a brand new hotel with all conforts. Pity it's not on the beach but there's a free shuttle. Also food is outstanding, served with a smile. Swimming pool is nice too , huge and very relaxing.\n", "\nStayed two nights at the Mantra Nusa Dua to attend a wedding at St Regis and to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Overall we are pleased with our choice to stay at the Mantra. We were delighted to be upgraded and to receive a fruit platter & strawberries with chocolate, together with a congratulatory card from the GM. The room was big and new, a lovely view from the huge balcony that has a day bed. The bathroom is big and the inviting pool runs the length of the resort. We have stayed in many Nusa Dua resorts and I would compare this with the Courtyard Marriott which we stayed 5 months ago - similar sized with the same minimalistic, modern resort at about the same price. The aesthetic Bali feel here is better. Only a year old, the Mantra is sitting on an area which is the newer part of hotel development outside the gated Nusa Dua gated area. The neighbours are the St Regis and the humoungous The Mulia. A slight downside is that its beach (5 mins car ride) is semi-private - shared with other properties. But at least the water and sand is cleaner than the Courtyard Marriott's beach. P.S - for breakfast it would be good to serve a full mug of coffee and not just half, also label the lifts panel to indicate which floor is the lobby, coffee house, spa etc. Overall, a good affordable hotel in its class.\n", "\nI stayed in Mantra for 5 days and I really won't leave. Love my deluxe room with spacious bathroom..unfortunately the toilet was bit smelly (its typical for hotels in Bali tho). The reception and bellboys were very friendly and helpful. The beach club was pretty good too. The only thing bothered us was the breakfast. Limited choices and its not that good.. hate the nasi goreng, its tasteless, chicken porridge was fine..lots condiments. The location itself was very remote, but you can rent a motorcycle for 80k/day. Overall I was happy with my stay! Good job Mantra..I'll definitely come back. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\n", "\nOur room was Panoramic suite and facing the sea. It is spacious with nice view and very good facilities. Our stay at Mantra Nusa Dua was pleasant and enjoyable. The Staff at the hotel were professional and always willing to help.\n", "\nWe stayed at this wonderful hotel from the 10th to the 16th February this year. The rooms were fresh and clean, well appointed and we had an awesome free standing bath in our room. The balcony overlooked the lush tropical forest and from the third floor or the second floor lounge you can see all the way to the surf breaking on Gegar Beach. The staff at this hotel were outstanding with nothing too much trouble, even after some mix up with our booking they fixed it immediately with no fuss. We enjoyed five star dining for my nieces wedding dinner and got them an Amazing deal on the honey moon suite. It is a short taxi ride or shuttle ride to the village and cheap as chips. The spa was also very relaxing and lovely overlooking the underground garden. Great pool and cocktails, but the outstanding feature of this hotel would have to be the staff!!!! my whole family loved it.\n", "\nI cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. The rooms are very clean and large. Great King bed made for a good nights sleep. We had a ground floor room with balcony and day bed, very close to the magnificent pool and Splash Bar. Drinks and snack were offered and delivered by service staff while reclining at the pool. We have never encountered such wonderful staff as here. All were very helpful, attentive, friendly and efficient. Our family who were staying at another resort , came to Mantra for dinner one night. A special table was set for us, and again staff were fantastic, particularly with our 2 year old grandson. The General Manager, Gary, introduced himself to us and was also focussed on personally ensuring our stay met all of our needs. I cannot speak highly enough of Mantra. It is a taxi ($2.50) or free shuttle ride into Nusa Dua and Bali Collection, but the quality of our stay more than made up for this. We, along with our visiting family recommend this hotel.\n", "\nOnly one criticism of this hotel: cold showers. The bath had hot water however. Otherwise, absolutely excellent. Great service and food and friendly staff. Our room was amazing. We thought it would just be a standard hotel room with a king bed. Instead we walked into a room with dining and lounge with a balcony as well as a king bedroom and gorgeous ensuite also with a balcony and day bed! Two large flat screen tv's as well.", "Free shuttle took us to most local places we wanted to go. Taxis to the Nusa Dua area were 25000 rp: cheap! I recommend this hotel.\n", "\nMy wife & I paid a \u2018special price\u2019 of US$99.00 for a 3 night stay in a deluxe suite, including breakfast and a 90 minute massage each in their health & spa. It was great value!!", "The room was huge and very comfortable. There was nothing missing and very good value.", "The breakfast was delicious and plentiful, with eggs cooked to your personal taste.

", "My big tip: We used the services of a random taxi driver for our personalised service for most of the days. Ie. we would have a driver take us shopping, to lunch, to the beach and have him wait for us, for 6 hours each day. The taxis charge about A$7 per hour for whatever, so we had them basically wait for us throughout the day (A$40 for a personal driver for a day is a no-brainer). Then the driver would collect us at dinner time to take us to a restaurant of our choosing. He would charge A$3 for a pick-up and drop-off to a local restaurant. The driver would then request the restaurant to return us to our hotel when we finished (which was always complimentary).\n", "\nAfter a terrible experience at a different hotel the night before, as soon as we arrived at the mantra we were relieved. Room interior is bright, spotlessly clean, lovely comfy bed, spacious bathroom (we got upgraded to the superior king), little balcony with daybed and chair. The pool is obviously the center piece of the hotel spanning the length of it and it was well maintained and great to just sit by and have a drink. Also great happy hour deal from 5 to 7pm - buy 2 get 3 free! ", "Staff also let us check out late, called metred cabs for us efficiently and helped us booked a restaurant. Staff were almost too keen to provide us with service when they called us while we were out at dinner about our laundry and again while we were sleeping at 11.30pm about the same matter. However we didn't mind too much because we really enjoyed the hotel.", "Is not on the beach but has shuttles in the morning and afternoon. Beach also easily accessible by taxi.\n", "\nNice hotel. excellent staff. clean. good free shuttle service to mall, beach, and shopping. Away from noise of other parts of Bali. Restaurant is OK. Pool very large and clean. We will stay again. Relatively new, clean, very reasonably priced for tourist. Few minute drive from attraction. Good service. OK food in clean, reasonably priced restaurant for tourist. I would hope it continues to grow.\n", "\nOverall for room, all ok. But when it comes to food, i would say its really bad. The mgmt really need to improve on good choice. Breakfast i would say its really bad. Most of the foods are dry. The mee hoon, bacon and sausages are so dry. The cold cut is watery. Other food selection from menu is also really bad. Not many choice. Other than food, the hotel is ok for stay\n", "\nWe booked our stay for three nights over the NYE period as our other hotel was booked out. This is a handly little hotel, whilst it's in early days it is clear it is still trying to iron out any issues. Things we liked- modern amenities, good views, upgrade to deluxe suite on top floor worth the money!, friendly staff who were most hospitable especially the team at reception. Things we didn't like- quality of the food, only one eating option with the same menu that applies to room service - very limited which is not good when it is an isolated hotel, build quality for a 10 month old building, leaking roof and bathtub ect... But cannot blame staff for that... I wouldn't recommend for long stays I.e 2 weeks, but is a clean, safe modern friendly little complex and value for money...", "Guys, had you have had your other eating outlets open as you have 3 or 4 mentioned online and in your in room folder but not (operating) and provided quality food with variety I would be giving 5 star for value. Unfortunately this is an area of focus together with safety in the wet. It's only a matter of time that someone seriously hurts themselves in the rain as the room corridors are exposed and front steps get very wet! Also when raining the restaurant gets wet therefore seating capacity drops? No undercover walk way to reception? Not good...\n", "\nMy Partner & I have been staying at this hotel for 10 nights. We have enjoyed our stay. Staff are very friendly and attentive.", "This place is a bit away from downtown, so if you look for a relaxation and peaceful place to stay. This is a good place, however, if you are going to spend many nights in Bali, we would suggest that you should split your stay between downtown (i.e. Seminyak) and Nusa Dua.", "However, we would like to thank you for the hospitality that was extended by the General Manager, Gary who greeted us each time we met as well as on our departure. He has also recommended us some of good places to visit or dine during our stay in Bali. ", "We were so lucky enough to receive a special discount on our Spa treatment and complimentary late check out. The Spa there was fantastic and My partner & I both enjoyed the traditional massage very much.", "Room is clean and comfortable. The only suggestion is that the courtesy bus to downtown should run more frequently instead of once a day during the Peak seasons. Alternatively you can go to the city by taxi which is very convenient. Staff at the entrance will call for a taxi for you. The taxi fare will cost you around $10-$15 (depends on traffic) which is quite cheap as compared with where we live (Australia)\n", "\nI am still in the hotel as I write this review. I checked into the hotel for my honeymoon for 2 nights in Nusa Dua on 26/12/2013 and the first thing I noticed that the location of the hotel is way off from the beach. If you would want a hotel near the beach then you would want to opt for some other option.", "Post my check in, I decided to go to the Greger beach where the hotel had its private beach. I was happy to know that the hotel provides free shuttle. I waited for 45 minutes for a shuttle to the shopping complex as I had already missed the last shuttle to the beach by a whisker in the evening. Post 45 minutes, the staff asked me to hire a taxi as their shuttle was already full!! I had to make the staff understand my frustration and after 15 minutes they did arrange a free ride. Though I do feel bad to have wasted 1 hour and not being able to go to the beach.", "Post my return, I requested to get a wake up call at 6:30 am, surprisingly, the wake up call was made only at 7:45 am when I was about to leave for breakfast!!", "On 27th I was out all day, upon return to the hotel late evening, the washroom starts to leak. I had to make couple of calls at the reception to get their attention as I had waited for 10-15 minutes and there was no one to help. After sending help, it was found out that the staff would require 40-60 minutes to fix the motor. I requested to be moved to another room and the staff moved me immediately to another room [ I had to pack my stuff within minutes just to spend the night in another room ]. The new room that I moved into, had issues with the balcony and by now I thought of only expecting the bed to not break down and the roof of the room to not fall on me.", "The rooms are nice and the breakfast was decent, other than that, I was happy to book only 2 nights here out of the 7 nights stay in Bali.\n", "\nHaving visited Bali only once previously 15 years ago we wanted to escape the hussle bustle of Kuta but still be within range of a host of facilities, the hotels shuttle buses catered for those needs, we went in the rainy season so it came in handy to get shuttles to either Kuta or the bali Collection in Nusa Dua, they also provided transport outside of the normal schedules for trips to the local Nusa Grill which had excellent views and ambience as well as good prices and good food. The hotel had a shuttle to the local Geger beach which also had great amenities, the staff were exceedingly helpful and all went the extra mile to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible Gary the general manager was very intent on making all his guest feel welcome and encouraged interaction with the staff and all the facilities at our finger tips. thoroughly enjoyable and the food was amazing, the bar staff, Koma and Wayan were good company and great fun which made for some interesting evenings, all the staff were extremely helpful and a special mention to Deedee who made sure that if there was something not quite right it was quickly organised for us. THOROUGHLY recomended and hope to return sometime in the near future.\n", "\nAs first time travellers to Bali the Mantra was a great choice for a relaxing holiday.

The standard of building finish is poor - don't know if this is just the Bali way\n", "\nHaving been to Bali 12 times now we have never stayed at Nusa Dua before. We read lots of reviews on different hotels & chose \"The Mantra\". What an excellent choice !

However The Mantra to us was far superior with views to die for from our room.", "We originally booked a superior room but decided to upgrade on arrival to a Panoramic room - talk about home from home - large,well appointed & beautifully comfortable.

However, there's a free shuttle bus to Bali Collection which has plenty of restaurants. Also several restaurants around Benoa over free pick up and drop off in their private shuttles.

Firstly, let me mention the location, it's very isolated, not a bar, restaurant or shop to be seen, so forget about a lovely stroll, there's nowhere to go. Then there is the condition of the property, for a hotel that is around 12 months old it's in poor condition, everywhere you look, both inside and outside requires maintenance.

There is a taxi stand in Nikko hotel I think it is possible for the reception to give them a call to get a cab. It is not near to the beach so you'll have to take their transfer service there.

Good sized rooms and plenty of storage.\n", "\nWe recently stayed at the Mantra in Nusa Dua and we loved it. The place is very quiet and offers the chance to get away from it all for a few days. The staff in all areas of the hotel were incredibly friendly and sought out any chance to make our stay more special. The fact that they bothered to know our names and remember our orders (for example: when ordering coffee to the room - it became - 'the usual'). We took the opportunity to upgrade to the third floor suites and I have to say it was one of the most luxurious rooms that I have ever stayed in. This made our trip all the more special. There is nothing close to the hotel but for a $2.50 taxi ride, or a trip on the free shuttle, you can get to the shopping strip of Nusa Dua where there are options for shopping, dinner and also a few supermarkets. There was no need to leave the area at all. When we did leave the area we used one of the hotel drivers, very reasonably priced and to boot a wonderfully, knowledgable driver who went out of his way to show us many sights. The breakfast is amazing, plenty of options and the best coffee. Thanks for the holiday to all of the staff! We will be back - sooner rather than later!!!\n", "\nRecently stayed here and loved it. Where to start? The pool is fantastic, there is a walkway running about 10ft above the pool which offers lovely shade when swimming.

Breakfast was excellent, full English, continental and asian all available, eggs cooked to order and wonderful attentive staff that made us feel very special. We had massages nearly every day, the ladies in the spa are fantastic and so professional. Our evening meals were also very good. Other reviewers are right in that there is nothing really outside the door, its a courtesy bus or taxi to anywhere, although we did walk back from the beach one day and its not that far really. Well done Mantra, we will be back.\n", "\nThis is a nice hotel with excellent staff.

I think it is more a new hotel to Mantra, as there are heaps of structural/maintenance signs that would suggest this hotel is not new - this is just the observation of a seasoned renovator.\n", "\nI stayed during four nights in a business trip. The hotel was perfect, staff was helpful and everything was new and clean. However, leisure travelers should be aware that this hotel doesn't have a private beach and it's a little far from the best ones.

I booked myself and my fianc\u00e9 a deluxe room so it had a really nice bath. The hotel is really brand new and large, it has a lovely pool which was always quiet when we were there and the staff speak English well. The hotel isn't walking distance to anywhere which was a bit disappointing as we usually like to walk to shops etc however there is a bus that goes to Bali collection - a shopping centre near by. It's not the greatest however. There is also a driver that will take you to the hotels \"private beach\" they have a few chairs down at the beach which is a nice quiet area, nobody hassling you and cheap yummy food! Definitely try the satay! ", "The hotel itself has a buffet breakfast which is fine, it has enough variety. The food available at the hotel is limited however and similar prices to Aus. It would be great to see more options on the menu as it is a bit of a pain to venture out for meals. Our room was really nice , the bed was a bit hard but nothing to complain about. Overall I would suggest to stay here if you want a relaxing trip doing nothing.\n", "\nWe stayed at Mantra for 5 days and we were pleasantly surprised at how efficient and friendly the staff were. Our 5 year old boy was treated to a surprise birthday cake by the breakfast staff which was a lovely touch. A special thank you to Didik for looking after our requirements; he is an asset to the hotel. ", "Rooms were spacious and the beds were really comfortable. The pool was great to swim in, and the outdoor balcony and daybed added to the relaxing ambience of the hotel. The only drawback is that the location is rather remote and you need a driver to get around.", "Overall we had a really enjoyable stay and will definitely recommend this hotel.\n", "\nCheck in was very pleasant as the check in while you are seated and give you a nice lemon tea and cold face towel. Very refreshing after along flight. The door cards do not always work and required a little patience at times. The room was quite large. The balcony had a double day bed but unfortunately when you sit it feels damp and sticky from the humidity. The balcony floor is covered in large while pebbles so that you cannot walk on them with on,y a few stepping stones to get to the bed. It makes the balcony not very usable and absolutely no view. We decided to walk to the nearest beach which is a good 15 min walk down but a steep walk back. Apparently they have a shuttle that goes to a different beach but does not start until 10am which was too late for us. Bed was firm but comfy. Air-conditioning was a little hard to get a nice temp. When we turned off the air con and came back to the room we could smell the faint odor of cigarettes and worked out later the smell was in the curtains. The pool was very clean, gardens lovely. The buffet breakfast had an excellent choice and service was really good. Alcohol was a bit pricey but seems to be the norm for these types of places. We brought our own the next day.\n", "\nWe stayed at the Mantra for 3.5 weeks in September, This is a welcoming friendly, really nice, lovely New Hotel in Nusa Dua, Check in super speedy with efficient staff, fast luggage delivery, rooms are large, clean, spacious and nicely furnished, huge bathroom, and has everything you need, the swimming pool is refreshingly cool with great waterfall features, relaxing music, very comfy \u201cpool lounges\u201d where I spent most of my time:)", "Breakfast buffet- Great selection of everything, very yummy, pretty much whatever you wish for is there, Splash Bar is great for pool service, drinks snacks lunch or dinner, also offering a Kids menu, along with the main restaurant.

Free transport to the beach, you can cross the road, walk down to the beach, where there is a temple, steps to the beach and a beach Caf\u00e9.\n", "\nThe room was well appointed, lovely pool and not overcrowded. Very friendly staff...especially Didi (hope I spelt that correctly). Still working on getting afew of the services going, such as the cafe, but it is a new hotel.\n", "\nVery good place to stay. Not much within walking distance but a free shuttle runs to the local shopping and entrainment area hourly. Great restaurants within the Accommodation. Place is clean and good size rooms. Staff are friendly and always have a smile on their face.\n", "\nWe stopped at Nusa Dua for 2 nights at the end of our Bali trip. We found the staff very welcoming and the hotel spectacular. Great sized rooms, easy shuttle bus to the Bali collection and awesome breakfast.

My room was on the 2nd floor, had a nice bathroom and a balcony which is quite big. The bed is comfy and furniture is simple but user-friendly. ", "The pool is surrounded by all rooms on either side and looks adorable. The gym is a simple one, not with too many weights, but turned out to be quite usable as I felt for once. ", "The Spa center is decorated in a rather simple and rustic fashion. BUT! The massage lady, by name of Sani, is an excellent one!!! I say so in the capacity of a spa ADDICT and based on my global experience of massages in many grand hotels. Remember to try her Balinese massage, and you will not regret it. ", "Staff here are all SO FRIENDLY. Didik, the Guest Relations Specialist is an extremely pleasant breeze I love to meet every day. He helps me on every activity I want to try and advise me where to go (thanks for recommending the Pandawa beach, which is much better than the popular Pedeng beach, Didik). Miss Dian, a truly beautiful girl in her early twenties from Jakarta, speaks wonderful English and smiles in a manner that makes the hardest iceberg thawed out instantly. She is so considerate and did a lot of favors for me as to my daily schedule, ranging from making local phone calls to various parties to arranging my laundry efficiently. Didik and Dian, I love the both of you so much!!! I want to let you know that you are among the best specialists in the hospitality world on earth, according to my intensive travel experience!", "The laundry prices in this hotel are UNBELIEVABLY affordable!! Quality is super. ", "Mr. Made, a Reservations Officer, helped me also a lot in pre-arranging my long list of activities to do in Bali. On the date of my arrival, the hotel sent a driver to pick me up. But my private driver was also waiting for me in the Arrivals Hall. Thus it was a double pick-up due to some emailing hitch. To my happy surprise, Made was kind enough in waiving the pick-up fee for my on my date of departure. Thank you sooo much for this very friendly and understanding gesture!!!", "I love everything about this hotel except for the Reservations Manager (Dameria), who was far from being efficient (she never confirmed your booking details, even if you called and emailed her a million times to urge her to do so. Strange enough).\n", "\nWe spent 3 nights here after a month of travelling through Indonesia and really enjoyed it! ", "The rooms are well equipped with a very nice bathroom, sofas and a sun bed on the balcony. The pool area is great with sunbeds and towels provided. The free billard was also a plus for us. Breakfast was perfect, all kinds of juices, bread, fruits, yoghurts, eggs plus pancakes, waffles, cheese made our day! Also the overall service was a highlight of our stay, e.g, we wanted to rent a scooter and it was organized within 2 hours for a very low price. ", "The shuttle to the beach (which is also within walking distance of 10-15 minutes) worked very well and is quite flexible. The hourly shuttle to the main mall was also a plus but could be operating also later in the evening (but taking a taxi is also not a big issue).", "Some minor issues arose regarding cleanliness which we think is quite usual in Indonesia, e.g, the mirror not being very clean or the pillows which had a bad smell (but were exchanged immediately after we complained about it). ", "Overall, we really recommend Mantra as it is a great hotel wIth great servIce for a great price and it does not matter that it's not directly located at the beach!\n", "\nWe stayed here for a week while I was 26 weeks pregnant. The staff went above and beyond to make our trip perfect. The staff would entertain my boyfriend at the bar while I went to bed early. One night at dinner I wasn't feeling very well (think I had heat stroke) the staff sent up complimentary tea and ask how I was the next day. The rooms where very clean and had all the essentials plus a bath robe and slippers. The day spa at the resort do the best manicure and pedicure I have ever had and where very reasonably priced. Would definitely stay here again.\n", "\nWe stayed at the Mantra Nusa Dua for 10 days September 2013. Its a nice new hotel, large rooms, nice modern bathroom and free standing bath. The bed was big and comfortable with nice pillows, sheets etc. Breakfast was good, lots of variety and the staff are friendly and helpful. The pool is lovely, really big and cold, lots of pool chairs and hardly anyone there so we basically had it to ourselves (nice fluffy pool towels and cushions on the lounges). We found the lunch menu limited and expensive. The resort is isolated so you cant walk anyway for markets or to eat out. The free Bali Collection shuttle bus comes every hour but I found the shopping centre pretty boring. We ate I the village one night but most of the restaurants had the same menu so it was a bit boring after a few days. The hotel is very quiet so if you are looking for some excitement this isn't the hotel for you, if you want quiet and nothing else then it would suit you. We got the room on a discounted rate of $109 so cant complain. I probably wouldn't choose to stay at this hotel again purely because of location but if that isn't an issue then you will love it. The food in the restaurant was ok to good, I only rated it low because of the price and variety.\n", "\nWe stayed 3 nights at Mantra Nusa Dua, Rooms were nice and have private balcony. Had an issue with the air-conditioning pipe bursting, it was fixed immediately with no inconvenience to us. Has the use of private beach and will transport you there and back. Staff couldn't be more helpful. We left some reading books in the room and after an email to them they were delivered to the next hotel we were staying in. Breakfast was lovely, we had eggs made fresh for us every day. Has a gym which is very basic( could do with a TV or some music) Would certainly go back.\n", "\nWe are currently staying at the mantra. We found the front desk staff to be excellent. The hotel entrance is less appealing than the hotel itself. The pool area is smaller than the hotel. The rooms are nice (4/5). Breakfast buffet was a 3/5 as the food was not too fresh however the French press coffee was a nice touch. For the hotel being new we found they were missing some finishing touches. Paint missing in areas and the finished touches were not done. However, we are quite picky. Overall it was a standard four star. Good location in proximity to the rest of nusa dua. Really close to mulia which has an excellent buffet. Overall it was a good value.\n", "\nI have just returned from a one week stay at the Mantra Nusa Dua and found it to be a great hotel. It is relatively new, the rooms are very spacious with a separate sitting area and have there own private balconies. The pool is large and always kept clean. The staff were very friendly and always tried to help out where possible to make my stay enjoyable. The breakfast provided with the stay was very good and offered a range of choice in foods. One thing that I initially had a concern about was the lack of places to eat around the hotel but the fact that there is a free bus to the Bali Collection shopping area every hour solved this issue. The hotel is also back from the beach but again a free service is provided to a private clean beach area with clear water. It is provided with sun lounges and towels. All in all this is a very good hotel in a quiet location and a great place to just relax.\n", "\nWe stayed in Mantra 3 nights and that was wonderful experience. I have never been in a hotel where is such a good service and nice staff. ", "First one example of this hospitality. About 20-years old guy who work in \"car-lobby\" name Zara ( don\u00b4t know how to write his name correctly) was extremely helpful. My brand new watch was broken and I bought that from Legian- Kuta. Zara make calls to Rip Curl shop and really tried to solve my warranty problems. Eventually I got new watch and that was delivered to Mantra. It was nice to see that someone was so good in customer service. All the time try do his best. That kind of worker is extremely valuable to the Mantra. Big thanks to him.", "Also my wife got very sick during our stay and 6am I need to get to the pharmacy. Immediately guy from the reception gave me a ride to town and we got some medicine.

Alicia also did her best to put my guests close to each other for ease of access. The front desk was very hard working, I think they have valeted parked my car on average 4 times a day, yet always so polite with a smile. The security at the gate always thoroughly checks the car, doing their duty. Breakfast is very nice, there is a switch between ala-carte and buffet at time(may be based on number of in house guests).", "I will like to thank Mantra, especially Alicia and George for co-coordinating this and taking all my last minute changes, and the rest of the staff for making it happen.

It's a new hotel, tastefully decorated with modern decor with a twist of balinese. We stayed in a deluxe room, which was spacious, with a King bed, large bathroom with rain shower and bathtub, and a private balcony with a sun lounge We had free in-room wifi which was great. Air-conditioning in-room was fantastic, especially coming back to after a long day shopping! The only downfall was the mattress was a bit on the hard side. There is a beautiful large central pool surrounded by sun lounges, we never had the issue of people \"reserving\" beds with a towel, as you do in larger resorts.

It's small, but has all the equipment you need for a great workout. Who exercises whilst on holiday anyway ;p", "Nusa Dua is a lovely area to stay to get away from the hustle and bustle and really relax, however there is not a whole lot to do in this area, so be prepared to pay a little more for transport to get around. The hotel does provide free private transport to and from the beautiful Geger beach which is only a few minutes away. There are sun lounges for Mantra guests which are beach front. There is also a free shuttle bus to Bali collection shopping center, which has many great restaurants. We missed the bus a couple of times and they offer \"private\" taxis only (not many metered taxis around) at a rate of 50,000 IDR for 5 min of travel! A bluebird taxi from the hotel to Kuta (30min drive) was only 100,000 IDR. ", "We loved staying at the Mantra. What made the hotel unforgettable was the staff, they were friendly and provided exceptional service, you would not received this kind of attentive service at a larger resort. We really felt like it was our home away from home. The hotel manager even personally greeted us at breakfast in the morning, which I thought was a lovely touch. It is very apparent that the hotel is well managed. I would definitely recommend staying here for a relaxing holiday, it offers great value for money in a modern hotel, in a quiet location!\n", "\nWe came as a family of 8 adults, 1 child and 1 infant and stayed on 4 rooms on the second level. When we arrived, pak Didi was very informative of the tours that we should take by providing itenarary. The room was cozy but the mattress was very hard, good someone with a backpain. We tried the bali massage and it was awesome after a day trip with the whole family. Breakfast buffet is nice to be enjoyed with whole family. Tried the pool in morning although the water was still cold but it was nice and enjoyable. The sound of the water feature from the pool was calm. The wifi connection is good inside the room, it would be great if the speed of connection is increased in the future. The tv reception was bad in our room though. Overall, Mantra is a good, quiet location and family place to spend holiday..\n", "\nIt's a new hotel and very clean. ", "Very friendly staff. Food is good too.

Yes it's not on the beach but there is a free shuttle whenever you want one to and from in a new air conditioned vehicle. The beach area is gorgeous with two cafe bars and beach massages. The hotel is relatively new which is actually quite nice and always spotlessly clean. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Bear in mind that there isn't an enormous amount to do in Nusa Dua but its the perfect location for a relaxing holiday or part of a holiday. We would definitely recommend booking a driver for the day who will take you to see real Bali. We saw silver smiths, wood carving, coffee plantation, lunch overlooking the rice paddies and painting as well as sarong making and a beautiful temple followed by a sunset meal at Jimberan Bay. For 10 hours and a guided tour we paid $70 USD or about \u00a345-50 which was very worthwhile. The hotel or hotel drivers can arrange this for you.", "10/10 for all aspects.\n", "\nI recently stayed at this new hotel in Bali, the first Mantra for Bali, but which is well know in holiday destinations in Australia. As with many hotels in Bali, the staff were exceptionally efficient, friendly and welcoming. The hotel was super clean and the ambiance was restful. The rooms were very well set out, and the beds super comfortable. It has a unique rain shower pool, that has overhead beams that produce rain like showers all day long. Breakfast was included and as an A La Carte menu, it was the best I have ever experienced. A great short break hotel very well priced. The day spa was well priced, great massages, and had some very interesting options including a Hindu Blessing on the beach. A most amazing experience. Even the senior management, who are usually behind the scenes, were hands on interesting people, making for great dinner conversation as I was a lone traveller. I fully recommend the hotel in every way.\n", "\nOur family (two adults and four children aged 20,19,16 and9) recently stayed at Mantra Nusa Dua for 11 nights.

My only complaint is that I'm back in Australia.\n", "\nWe stayed back in April and were first time visitors to Bali. We loved our stay at Mantra Nusa Dua and found all aspects of the hotel amazing!

We found your people extremely polite, cheerful and only too keen to assist us with any question or enquiry we may have had (and sorry, being first time visitors to Bali, we had a few !!). From the warm greeting in the morning at Breakfast to all their help during the day, nothing was ever too much trouble making it a most relaxing and friendly place to stay. The complimentary transfers to and from the beach with your own sun lounge in the shade of the umbrella waiting you is another very nice touch, and as for the pool - so nice and refreshing after a hot day out exploring this amazing place. Staying at the Mantra Nusa Dua certainly made our Bali holiday a memorable one and when we return we will definitely be coming back ! Regards, Leanne & Kingsley.\n", "\nMy wife and I recently returned from an 8 day holiday in Bali and one of the highlights for both of us was the last 3 nights we spent at Mantra Nusa Dua. Although the Hotel was not quite complete the staff more than made up for any inconveniences that arose because of the final works being carried out while we were there. As owners of a Mantra Unit in Australia and therefore regular Mantra Hotel patrons the experience was without doubt the most rewarding in our 10 years of being Mantra customers. We found the real difference was the staff in the Hotel right from the Porter on arrival & departure to the table Waiters & Waitresses right up to the Executive Assistant Manager, nothing was too much trouble and their polite, gentle manner was infectious and made a stay a real pleasure - well done to all concerned.\n", "\nOur family stayed at the Mantra for 4 nights and although the hotel was not fully complete this in no way detracted from our wonderful stay here. The rooms were modern & stylish and we certainly enjoyed the very comfortable beds. The breakfasts were absolutely delicious as were all our meals at the restaurant. The highlight of our stay was the service and the friendly staff. I cannot speak highly enough of how welcome they made us feel and of the service they provided. Whether it was organizing a day trip or transport, or the simple things like providing a towel at the pool or a cool fresh face washer it was done with such warmth and the friendliest of smiles. Thank you to Gary his management team and staff who made this a truly wonderful stay.\n", "\nI have just returned home from a week in Bali staying at Mantra Nusa Dua with a group of friends, it was the perfect home away from home. The hotel is brand new and whilst still in its finishing stages you can't fault the outstanding service provided by the friendly, genuine staff. They went above and beyond and exceeded all our expectations. Every morning we were greeted with a smile and by name, provided with helpful local advice, the very BEST massage in Bali (the new day spa will be amazing, recommend their signature treatment) to delivering breakfast in bed when i wasn't well. I couldn't fault anything. The layout and ambience of the hotel is gorgeous and the size of the rooms is standout, 52 sq for a superior, if you like a bath recommend upgrading to deluxe. Rates include breakfast and all meals were exquisite, compliments to the chef. Thank you Mantra Nusa Dua you made our holiday unforgettable I wish we could stay longer however we will be back. Thanks to Gary and all the staff. Regards Angie.\n", "\nThough still a work in progress, it is far enough along to be a perfect new boutique style hotel with clean smooth lines and fresh appeal. It is a fusion of zen simplicity and order and subtle Balinese flavours. The spacious pool and its contemporary designed waterfalls lend a harmonious look to the hotel including a virtual duck pond with reeds and wooden ducks. The rooms are spacious and and each has a courtyard with outdoor couch, perfect for meditating or enjoying the natural surrounds with exquisite bird life. This hotel is set on the edge of the Nusa Dua hotel strip so it has peace and quiet and will overlook the river and forest with its villages when completed. The restaurant looks out over the pool and so has a peaceful ambience. A really lovely property but not if you are looking for the grandeur, mammoth size and eating choices of the nearby Nikko resort which is a superb choice if that is what you are looking for. Oh yes and best of all is the wonderful service and eagerness to please - the staff exude the excitement of being in a brand new place. Lovely people! They even tried to help me with my laptop which decided over breakfast, to split its LCD screen in two and I am sending this from the quarter screen that still works. Drama follows me! Oh and the beach of course - it is a short walk via the temple next to the \"over the top\" new massive resort that they would have to pay me to stay in and whose gaurd chased me away for taking photos of their Romanesque water goddesses that loom up into the sky. The hotel takes you to their beach with its own chairs any time you want and pick up too. So nothing is missing and if you want to shop, the free shuttle comes regulrarly. I walked back along the beach from The Grand Hyatt - a great walk!\n", "\nI stayed in Mantra Nusa Dua as it was strategic to the location for a group event that my company had organized for our client. Their Superior room was a large 51 sqm with a daybed in the balcony, a monster in size compared to the hotel I stayed previously at Santika Siligita at 21 sqm. They were kind enough to upgrade me to the Deluxe room, same size as the Superior with an added bathtub and full glass window looking out to the bedroom. I love the free WiFi in the room and also in the public areas like in the restaurant so I can stay connected with my business correspondences..unfortunately this is a business trip. But that\u2019s the thing, it doesn\u2019t feel like a business trip when the staff were so attentive and the hospitable, not stuffy like those city hotels. I was made aware that they have complimentary shuttle to a private space on the beach nearby (3 minutes\u2019 drive) but I didn\u2019t have a chance to do that amidst my busy schedule. I will definitely come back for a leisure trip and recommend you to try this hotel\u201d\n", "\nStayed 3 nights wish it could have been longer.

He even promised to bring us to a good babi guling place (the one we ate that afternoon was a disappointment). Since the hotel is on a \"hill\", they do provide transport to the nearby Geger Beach and even a guide to show us to the beach chairs (i think since the hotel is not along the beach, they need to reserve some chairs for the Mantra guests at the beach). ", "On my 2nd day @ Mantra, things turned bad for me, I had very bad poisoning and was in so much pain that i had to get my friend to ask the hotel to get the doctor to go to the hotel. I don't know how long i waited (i just know that i was in so much pain and weak from all the vomiting and diarrhoea), finally the doctor came! The doctor said they had to send me to the hospital for drip and observation. When i was being lifted to the stretcher, i saw all the anxious faces of the Mantra staffs standing outside my door. My friend later told me that while i was in the toilet wringing in pain, the Mantra staffs were at the lobby wringing their hands waiting for the ambulance to arrive, At that moment, i feel that i wasn't alone, all these people genuinely care for me! Dik Dik even came along to the hospital despite it's after his working hours! And he even called the hospital the next day morning to check if am really ok! Lucky i was able to discharged within that night and was back to Mantra at midnight. I have stayed in many hotels (big chain ones) BUT i have NEVER EVER experience such caring and sincere gesture from a person whom he/ I just met a day ago plus he did all these from the bottom of his heart! We tried giving him a tip but he refuse saying it that it's his job and it's what he does. A job that extends out of working hours and that kind of concern, Dik Dik, I don't think so. He even went to great length to call the chef to cook something hot and light for my breakfast, ask me for the kind of tea i drink & send it to my room, let us have a very late check-out since our flight was a night one and most touching of all was a flower arrangement and card signed by the Staffs of Mantra!

Gary expect my call soon :) I am sure once the rest of the build up completes, the hotel will be even more enjoyable.", "Maybe just a personal thing, the default aircon temperature of less than 22'c was a bit cold, 24-25c will be nicer. :)\n", "\nThe staff was amazing! The Mantra just opened, so I was one of the first guest they had. I was only going to stay for 5 days, but I stayed for 11. The staff was very helpful, they even helped me when I changed my flights so I could stay longer. Room was great, very clean. Bed was comfortable, loved sitting on the balcony in the morning. Breakfast was great, had it delivered to my room in the morning. I would recommend anyone going there, you will have a great experience. I will be going back for sure and staying at the Mantra.\n", "\nFirst impression that I noticed was this hotel had a local vibe beyond. Very enjoyable yet relaxing to stay at this hotel.

Ok it's not on the beach you have to go through a lane way about 5 minute walk.", "As for the noise of the loud music there is non from the hotel that music was from an Indian wedding next door in the Sofitel on the Saturday night before we got there it went on until 5 am apparently which was no fault of the grand whiz.", "Yes agree the breakfast is not the best they seem to cater more for the Asian people noodles chicken porridge, no yoghurt or marmalade for the 2 types of bread but to there defence they go out of there way to help did bring out yoghurt but runny and plain. And did bring out marmalade and jam portions on the last day I realised they had a man cooking waffles and pike lets which were very popular gave up waiting. the egg station was good if you like eggs made to order not stale as the other comment was mentioned.

Only drawback, was during check in. We came in at 10 am but were provided with the room at 12:00 pm. So had to wait. I do not blame the hotel too as they said, they didnt have the rooms empty yet and my booking was from 12:00 pm. However, we were happy with the upgrade to Premium for the 4 nights we stayed. Highly recommend this!!\n", "\nWe stayed here for three nights after a three night stay at Kuta. The rooms are very clean, spacious and cheap, we paid \u00a333 a night including breakfast. Breakfast is good and food at the hotel pool is very reasonably price and was the best noodles/rice we've had so far in Bali. Staff are extremely friendly and will always recommend good places to visit and book reservations for you? Most restaurants will send someone to pick you up and take you to and from for free so check with reception before booking a taxi. The beach is 200m away from the hotel however a buggy can take you if required. The beach has free sun beds at the grand whiz bit but it's not the best beach. Get a taxi to geger public beach, sun beds are 50rp for 2 and the beach is much better with a couple of nice cafes there. We also hired a bike from the hotel free of charge for 1 hour which was fun. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the price of a small beer, 43rp without tax so 53 - this is like \u00a32.50 and in other places you can get a large beer for 30rp. We stayed in a more expensive hotel in Kuta but the beer was cheaper so I guess it swings in roundabouts. Also air con not as good but still ok and a little noisy!

The only downside with the room was that it didn't have a bathtub. Otherwise despite being close to the car park it was nice and quiet.

The day spa is excellent value. The rooms are comfortable. We could not fault anything, above all the staff are truly customer focused & being greeted with those sweet smiles each day makes you feel you have escaped to paradise.

I asked reception if it was possible to move, but the hotel was fully booked, but they said if I came back after breakfast in the morning they would be able to move us. They gave us twin rooms next to each other on the lagoon pool side. Amazing rooms and so nice to be able to walk straight out into the pool. This area of the pool is one depth and is straight and narrow, so my mum was able to walk up and down each morning and for the first time in years we could all enjoy the pool at the same time. The rooms are spotless and we had no problems with the hotel, staff are very friendly and nothing is to much trouble. My only suggestions would be to have a way out of the lagoon pool i.e steps, if you are not capable of lifting yourself out of the pool, you have to walk to the end and them up the steps from the other pool and then through the corridor to your room.

He backed down and agreed they were wrong to sebd people to their rooms to eat and not give any other option. So they suddenly opened the restaurant and we could enjoy a meal.

Another problem we had was our room stank of cigarettes despite none of us smoking so was very gross and didn't seem fresh, it took 2 days for them to do something about it and could not offer us a room close to family.

My only real negative experience here came to currency exchange - where I was quoted one rate by one staff member that was agreed upon, only to have that rate changed to one significantly less favorable by a different staff member with no real explanation.

Have a nice holiday :)\n", "\nI find this hotel very suitable for couples and solo travelers. If you don't mind the 5 min walk to the beach access part, it is in a great location. I find the free breakfast very nice and convenient especially when you have a full day of schedule ahead. Food is good and unlike what other reviews said, i find the choices to be alright. The room is slightly small so if you have more than 3 people in your party, you may want to get another room.\n", "\nCame here for three days and would come back.

After pointing out that we already paid more and that I was very disappointed he finally gave in and moved us downstairs.", "The hotel staff are really great, especially the restaurant staff. They took great care of us and were very genuine. We had a nice candle lit dinner setup for us at the pool area, which was really lovely. The food is good and the pool is stunning and clean!", "One downside is the location- Nusa Dua is very quiet and doesn't offer a lot of shopping or restaurants. Beach is 5 mins walking distance though and we also walked to the Bali Collection shopping centre (hotel has free shuttle buses). Nusa Dua would suit couples or families that only want to relax and swim on their holiday. Very good value for what you pay!", "The SPA was really lovely too!", "I would come back and stay again, it was very relaxing!\n", "\nstayed here for a conference week. it was quite cheap considering the location within the walls of BTDC. however it is quite expensive considering the small room.

It is immaculately kept and a fairly new resort in Nusa Dua. The staff are fantastic! The pool was the most stunning pool I have ever been in! It is truly quiet and peaceful (as long as you don't get noisy neighbours!) we could hire bikes and we went riding along the Nusa Dua foreshore and the resort is only a 3 minute walk to the beach. And only a $3 cab ride into the main st for restaurants etc. that's if you don't want to eat at the delicious restaurant at the resort... For the price we payed I was extremely happy!\n", "\nThe hotel itself is nice clean and well kept, unfortunately I can't say the same for the staff. We really didn't feel welcomed at All. First they didn't have our booking and wouldn't let us check in untill wotif forwarded it again to them. We had to do all the work to get this forwarded after a long effect to get to the hotel. The room we were given was an inter connecting room which our neighbour thought watching tv full blast at 1am and taking 2 showers 1 at 2am and again at 4am was a good idea. ", "The pool is lovely, however there is a need for more sun loungers. We were invited to seafood Buffett for 90 000 on arrival we were told that it only included soup and rice dishes for 1 serve of seafood it would cost 150 000 plus tax. Considering they are 4-5 star I would of expected them to be upfront about costs. Secondly I would of appriciated free use of the bicycles considering the cost of the room. ", "As for location this is high dependant of the visitor for us it was like being in a toy town, very fAlse just not our cup of tea. If you dicide to go down the beach which is accessed via the neighbouring hotel don't use the loungers as they require $20 nZd for there use despite grand whiz informing thy hve an agreement with hotel for us to use them. Overall not the best trip, I reccomend a 1 or 2night stay in Nusa dua area to experience the place then move on, but don't reccomend the hotel unfortunately.\n", "\nI spent Christmas 2013 at the grand whiz and what a pleasant experience it was. The staff were very friendly and attentive. The place was very clean and tidy. My room was spacious and cool with air conditioning which was especially handy as the weather was very humid. Plenty of channels on tv to watch if your having a lazy day. The pool was excellent and it was great to have a child safe pool for my daughter to splash about. The food was great and inexpensive. Although it is not right by the beach the staff were happy to transport my family and I to the nearby beaches and bali collection. Taxis are also very affordable. Breakfast had an excellent selection of foods. I particularly recommend the bali cakes and pastries they are delish. They also put on a wonderful Christmas dinner for all the guests. I stayed for two weeks with my 2yo daughter the and the service was consistent. Although there are many things to do in Bali I always looked forward to getting back to the hotel.

For those who prefer to stay nearby restaurants, malls, cafes, clubs, or any other entertainment of such, choose Kuta or Jimbaran.\n", "\nGrand Whiz had exceed my expectation. The hotel is new and clean, staffs are very friendly and the food at the restaurant is great. The location is a bit far from the beach but you can rent a scooter or the hotel can provide you shuttle.

The hotel is 5 min walk to the CC. It's cozy, friendly, & clean. Breakfast is somehow poor with limited choices. Rooms with pool view are nice & u can dive from ur room directly into the pool. Staff are nice & friendly, same as all Indonesian people. Hotel is not luxurious but is good place to stay in.\n", "\nWe were expecting this place to be amazing. While the room was fantastic as was the pool, almost every evening a pungent smell came through our air conditioner of sewerage and it had to be turned off.

The service upon arrival was outstanding, check in was quite informative and we were escorted to our villa by our own private butler who then gave us a run down on all the amenities within the villa. The upstairs and downstairs accommodation was very opulent and spotless as you would expect for the cost of the stay. The location is in what I would call a \" less desirable precinct\" as We would not venture out at night unless picked up by taxi from the lobby area. There is absolutely nothing of interest close by. The private pool was shaded for 90% of the day the whole downstairs area lacked any type of direct sun shine which made the water temperature of plunge pool icy cold. The Tanalounge consists of only approx four dining tables and very limited alcohol beverages on offer. Meals were OK but nothing to rave about. No cocktails are served at this resort only wine, beer, soft drinks and mock tails. Meals are mainly consumed within the villa. Privacy is guaranteed butler will only enter villa via butler door after using intercom. We did not spend much time in our villa at all due to the lack of sun and would get a taxi each morning back to Benoa to rejoin family and friends staying at Grand Aston, spend the day there in the sun, have dinner in Benoa then return in time to go to sleep. Not what I was expecting at all. This is a perfect place for couples who want to lay around all day doing nothing, dine alone or just read a book.

Quite modern with not too much of a Bali Feel though. Very clean and well presented. ", "We stayed 2 nights at these villas. We ate at the restaurant on the first night we found the food average and cold by the time it hit the table. Breakfast we had delivered to the room both mornings and it was cold by the time it got to us. It seems that if you had 4 different hot items on your plate that they could only cook 1 at a time. By the time that they cooked the 4th item the other 3 were cold.", "I believe that there must have been a Muslim Mosque close by because each morning we were woken before sunrise.

For instance, when I requested to shut off water fountain in the pool during dinner, the fountain shut off 30 minutes later when I already finished dinner.", "Also, my Indonesian Fried Rice (Nasi Goreng) was missing fried Chicken that was stated in the menu. When I acknowledged the staff, the staff simply said \"I will look into it\" and brought me a saugy piece of drumstick when I already finished my meal without an apology or what-so-ever.", "Some reviews praise about their food: I wonder if their food has seasonality. On the day of check in, my wife and I arrived late so we just ordered room service. I got me a sandwich and my wife got herself a pasta. I believe it is pretty hard to make a bad tasting sandwich so sandwich was o.k, but the French fries that came with the sandwich was horrid. It tasted like frozen fries that were only thawed. No crisp. Also, the pasta tasted o.k. (edible), but the prawns in the pasta did not taste fresh at all so I advised my wife not to eat it to avoid chance of food poisoning.", "Next morning, we each ordered Indonesian Fried Rice and Yellow Coconut Rice. Food came 45 minutes later and they were cold. Also, they tasted way worse than 20,000rp stuff on street. Limited by choices, I ate Fried Rice four mornings. Exact same fried rice, but they all tasted slightly different. ", "Location was quite bad. Far from beach, far from anything. I went out late at night, looking for a place to eat. Within 5km range, I couldn't find any legitimate looking restaurant but very local looking places that will probably give me bali belly.

The water in the sink didn't drain fast enough so it looked gross. However, the issue was addressed immediately.", "To sum up, my stay at Tanadewa Villas was a bit of a disappointment. I still can't get over the food part.\n", "\nWe stayed here for our anniversary, the staff were all so lovely and went above and beyond to make it special for us. The villa was so lovely and private but because of that .There was not alot of sun in our villa.

Love this place to the max.The staff in this villa also very friendly.Tried the spa at the villa,spa is good and love the friendliness and the smile from the spa therapist.Had breakfast beside the pool,its awesome.Worth the price with good wifi..Nothing bad that i say say of.\n", "\nNice beautiful place with an amazing view. The staff are generally very friendly and helpful. The only downside about this villa is the inconvenience to get around by foot. Great place for honeymoon if you don't want to get out of the villa. If you are looking for entertainment, better get some villa near Kuta and not so high up on a hill. The pool is super cold even during the daytime, couldn't enjoy much. Quite pricey for this villa and it's location.

After doing a bit of research, we found very positive reviews on the place and decided to go ahead and book our trip with them. Upon arrival at the airport, we had a very friendly driver who took us to the resort. We arrived early in the morning and even though the check in time was supposed to be in the afternoon, the staff very kindly prepared and allowed us to enter the villa and were very helpful during the whole of our stay in bali. The place was very clean as expected, and the only drawback we felt during the trip was when we tried to use the jacuzzi function installed in the bathtub. We couldn't get it to work so we fumbled around with it a couple of times and after a while it suddenly turned on, giving out a foul smell at the same time, like the smell of sewage water. The bathroom smelt really bad for quite a while, but thankfully by the time we got back from our day out, the smell was gone. All in all, it was a beautiful place and I really recommend it for couples who are looking to unwind and relax. We would definitely love to come back the next time we're in bali!\n", "\nNice place ..convenient ..", "Me and my hubby likes the private pool very much especially after gym and having our breakfast just right in front of the pool are so so relax ..Well although the aircon are little warm the rest are all fantastic ..", "Good warm service as well...keep it up ..Me and my husband will definitely visit tanadewa again\n", "\nWe went there for our honeymoon and the villa was exactly how they illustrated it but even better. The staffs was really helpful and nice. Special mention goes to Pak Madey our butler whom was the nicest person. All the awesomeness aside, there were only three complaints. The aircond was on the warmer side, the bathtub/jacuzzi gave out a stench when in use although it was very clean. Lastly the pool was wayy too cold. But apart from that it was a really memorable place and would definitely love to come back in the future.\n", "\nWe had a wonderful time. Excellent service by the staff. Tanadewa was the best part of our honeymoon!The staff was so considerate that they made a playlist of romantic songs on the iPod on knowing it was our honeymoon.

The shuttle was a plus :) Me and my husband enjoyed this villa most of all the places we stayed, we loved the whole floor plan. There wasn't much view but we were focused on enjoying each other's company so it didn't bother us that much... Just a little critique is that the ac wasn't as cold as I expected..

But, Tanadewa's excellent management and staff did apologize for the same and gifted us a Spa treatment at free of cost,", "They can try including some South Asian cuisines (Indo-Pak) as i observed they have a good turnout of people from this region of the world as well. Me being a world traveler, can adjust to any kind of cuisine, but the food was a little bit of a challenge for my spouse.

Tanadewa was absolutely amazing.", "From the staff, to the villa, to the view from the breakfast table- everything was perfect. The place is quiet and secluded, and exactly what we needed. It was the perfect start to our honeymoon.", "We had a pick and drop option to Bali Collection (shopping place) and the Nusa Dua beach area which was great and we did utilise it a lot. We booked a tour to Ubud which was great too. The breakfast was lovely and loved the fact that when it was brought to the villa, it was really good too.", "The villa itself was spacious, clean, and extremely comfortable. Loved the pool and the area by it. It was open air whilst indoor which was brilliant. Loved sitting by the lounge/pooll at night and when it was raining. The view was absolutely stunning.", "All in all, highly recommended. The location may come off as a con to many, but we loved it. Must visit again.\n", "\nWe stayed in tanadewa villa, a lovely boutique villa, in January 2015. The staff there is polite and the room & toilet is clean. Our booking come with breakfast. choices of breakfast was kind of good, ranging from local to western, and they provide option for you to eat it in your villa. However, the portion can be small for some of the breakfast choices. our villa is a 1 bedroom villa. You enter at mid floor, climb a flight of stairs up & you reach the bedroom. Likewise, if you climb a flight of stairs down, you will reach the living room, kitchen & the indoor swimming pool. The space is kind of cozy for 2. The bedroom has an attached bathroom cum toilet. There is a jacuzzi bathtub, standalone shower & toilet area. Frosted windows are used for the bathroom. Do be careful when you used it at night as it can be seen from external when the lights are on.\n", "\nVilla was very spacious and private,which really met the purpose of our trip as we were looking to spend quality time with much needed privacy and quietness.We enjoyed having our daily breakfast at the villa itself. Felt homely and again enjoyed the privacy.

It was really relaxing and soothing and surely enjoyable.", "Two main down-sides of this villa were namely the mosquitoes and cold pool. As we went during Dec,which was a rainy season in Indonesia,there were a lot of mosquitoes in the villa, be it at the dining area or in our room. The hotel provides mosquito coils which were useful but there was only one mosquito coil stand given. We had to carry it with us constantly whenever we moved about in the villa. It was inconvenient and cumbersome as the villa is 2 storey.I did feedback to the hotel staff on this,suggesting that they should provide at least 2-3 mosquito coil stands so that guests can put n use them at various parts of the villa. To me it's pointless to have so many mosquito coils but with just one stand when mosquitoes there seemed to be commando trained and are not totally warded off by coils which are lit. We ended up having many mosquitoes bites all over our limbs and bodies..perhaps as souvenirs for us to bring back to spore as the bites lasted very long even after our trip.", "Also it was nice to have a private pool in the villa. However we were unable to use it at all as the water was quite deep and cold. Even tho the weather was warm, water was not so there was no way to even have a soak in there for 5 min.I wonder how families with young kids can utilise the pool with such depth n such coldness of water. Perhaps it will be great if water can be warmed a little and m sure guests will enjoy it thoroughly and even daily.", "Ok sorry. Few more small points to bring up.Aircon in our room was spoilt and hotel staff was not able to fix it. We ended up having to move to another villa instead. ", "There were also lizards in both rooms which we stayed in. Hotel staff were not able to help get rid of the lizards as they were hiding at the ceiling areas and we could hear them making noises thru out our days and notes at both villas.

We may opt to stay in this hotel again but probably not during rainy seasons!\n", "\nWe stayed in the 2 bedroom villa the first 3 days and it was fantastic.

They are to die for!", "The villa is split into two floors. The lower floor contains the pool and a small lounge area where you can enjoy the calming sounds of the fountain while having breakfast while the upper floor is fully airconditioned with the beautiful bathroom suite. A good tip is to make sure to keep the door closed. Not only does it keep the mosquitoes out, it also ensures the room stays cool.", "Bathroom facilities were fantastic. There was ample room and plenty of supplies so you could use it liberally. Nice water pressure too. I did not really try the jacuzzi so I can't comment on some of the earlier reviews.", "Made, our butler, really went the extra mile in providing excellent service. The rest of the staff should follow in his foot steps to take some extra initiative. On the night I left, the butler in charge (not Made) did not even help me with my luggage.", "Another thing that management should look into is the airconditioning.

I highly recommend this venue for the value for money!\n", "\nWent there as a getaway from the hectic life, really did relaxed, place was serene, enjoyed the private time yet very cosy villa, the food by the hotel was good, everything was clean n smells good too!

We were planning to have it early in the morning but turn out it is opened at 9am which we were not fully informed. May be we overlooked the info but it would be nice should we be informed upon arrival. Or the hotel could have made it early as 9am is a bit late for my taste.", "6.

First of all, make sure you note the address right and possibly have a bit more of landmarks for the taxi driver. It is quite a new villa so some drivers didn't know where it was and it took a few calls to other drivers to find the way. We stayed in the one bedroom pool villa and was surprised to find a split level and very spacious villa. The pool area downstairs was definitely the highlight - we loved the stunning pool and enjoyed sitting around downstairs with some drinks and bask in the heat. Upstairs is the bedroom and bathroom, from where we can look down to the pool area. The villa is definitely luxurious - the bath was big and the bathroom was immaculate. The villa has 3 TVs - one downstairs in the lounge area by the pool, one in the bedroom, and one by the bath. On one of the mornings I actually felt rather feverish and didn't want to go to the main house for breakfast - the staff kindly phoned us in the villa and offered to deliver some breakfast! What a service! We also booked a couple massage which you can have in a separate villa - the set up was beautiful and it even has a bathroom where you can shower without going back to your own villa. Our therapists were amazing and we felt rejuvenated afterwards. If you have a few hours to kill after check out and heading to the airport you're best to book a massage and then have a shower in the massage villa rather than killing time in the airport or wandering aimlessly. Location-wise there isn't much around the villa but they have a complimentary drop off to the Bali Tourism Development Corporation (BTDC) complex where shops and restaurants mainly are. It is located about 10 minutes drive to the villa so it wouldn't cost you much to get a cab too.\n", "\nWe recently stayed at Tanadewa as our second of three resorts in Bali. We had a bit of trouble finding it as our taxi driver had never heard of it (this happened a few more times with a few more taxi drivers) so make sure you tell them it's up a narrow street opposite the POP hotel. We were greeted with cool drinks and a beautifully scented cool cloth, check-in was fast and we were quickly escorted to our private one bedroom villa (#11). We were really impressed with the layout, the size (bedroom upstairs is huge), and the plunge pool was fantastic! There a few minor things we were a little disappointed with (possibly magnified by the fact we had just come from an exceptional five star resort where everything was perfect)... Upstairs was very hot, even with the air con going and door shut - I had to dress for a wedding (guest) and it was very uncomfortable, I felt like my makeup was melting off my face before I even had my dress on. Also we wanted to have a romantic spa bath one night but when we turned it on, it quickly filled the bathroom with the most putrid smell (I assume it just hadn't been used in a while). Breakfast was included in the rate which was great but it was a bit of a non event... there was very little to choose from and what was there was more like dinner food (one of the waiters told us that the chef was Indian and therefore the food dishes were Indian cuisine...). There was bread and a toaster if you wanted to make your own toast, no cereal or yoghurt or even fruit. Instant coffee, tea or juice were available. Check-out was equally as hassle-free as check-in and they were lovely enough to let us leave our bags there for a few hours while we shopped before moving on to our next resort. All-in-all it was good, but with so many villas to choose from in Bali, I'm not sure I would stay at this one again? (My husband said he would, and for the record he liked the breakfast, lol).\n", "\nVilla is huge and well equipped. Clean and very beautiful.

We were blown away by the size of the villa. Private swimming pool. Spa bath with TV. Butler excellent. We had complete privacy. We did not know there were other guests but all 16 Villas were full. Perfect for a honeymoon even if we were married for 35 years. Shuttle bus into Nusa Dua every 2 hours.\n", "\nWe had the worst view in the villa, I guessed... The seaview is completely blocked by a huge grey wall. And the sense of security/privacy is totally depleted by a small pavilion situated on top of the wall.. Luckily these are recompensed by the friendly service & good facilities here... It's a 2 storey villa, with 1 bedroom on the upper deck and swimming pool with parlour & dinning table on the lower deck. There are total 3 tv, 1 at the bedroom, 1 at the jacuzzi bathtub & 1 at the parlour, 60 over channels cable tv to watch.. a plus bonus for a Bose iPod dock, a capsule coffee machine & a safe box to store your valuables. however the dinning area has no cooking stove/microwave for simple cooking/heatin up food. Not to say a BBQ pit.. But they have in-house lounge with a good selective of menu and room-service to have the food delivered and set up in your villa.\n", "\nOur stay at Tanadewa was really relaxing. The staff were great, relaxed yet always happy to help and courteous.", "The villas are a great size, with everything you could want in them, clean and well organised. The option to have food in your room as opposed to the dining room at the same cost was great and added to the feeling of relaxing seclusion. The spa was great, with well trained and pleasant staff, and very reasonably priced. The villas are definitely the sort of place that if you didn't want to go out you could definitely wile your day away in quite comfortably. This was a really enjoyable stay, and if we head to Bali without the children again, we would certainly be staying here again.", "Areas for improvement are all a little niggly, but include; having two keys for the room rather than one would be better. Rather than taking away the mat for the sun lounge at night, potentially having another it could be switched for, or organising to remove it later. Having more than one treadmill in case one breaks (as it was for 4 of the 5 days we stayed) or you would like to run with someone else. Some form of heating for the plunge pool, and outdoor shower would be good, as it was almost too cold to use especially in the evening. Hooks for the towels on the verandah posts or similar would be good. Having the sound for the downstairs television routed to a speaker by the couch so the volume could be lower and less sound would carry to neighbouring villas (which was only an issue on the last day as the new couple next door seemed to like to have it on extremely loud). Having more coffee/tea available in the rooms, and ensuring that there are enough packets of creamer and two sugars per coffee and tea sachet. Maybe a few more beers in the mini-bar would be good two, especially if you are staying in for a day, two just isn't enough and while you can order more it's a bit of a pain. Though now I'm really starting to reach for things to improve.", "Things to note: the location is in-between most locations, and transport will be required wherever you wish to visit (a free shuttle does run to Nusa Dua, (but doesn't pick you up again), having said that though, taxis are cheap and easy to get a hold of, so it's worth it for the more central location if you are looking to travel around Bali more, and really after seeing the other more traditional hotel locations, I'd rather stay away from them and visit as a day trip.", "Overall, our trip and stay while brief this time around was immensely enjoyable, and Tanadewa (especially the staff that work there, \"Thank you\") helped in large part to make it so.\n", "\nMy partner and I visited for 2 days before heading to Kuta for the remainder of the holiday and we thought we'd try Nusa Dua. Private villa was absolutely amazing, size of the place was great, photos don't do it justice!! Service was exceptional by the staff and they were very accommodating even letting us check in 2 hours earlier without a fuss! Only 2 small disadvantage - 1. Pretty far out from the main beach (even though they had complementary shuttles every 2 hours) and 2. Pool was freeeeezing! Besides that would definitely go again in a heartbeat!\n", "\nExcellent for busines, not really for holidays. Be pr\u00e9par\u00e9e to use the bleu taxis which arrive almost instantly.

Ok if you want to be completely by yourself. Service not the greatest. Attentive and willing staff but they don't seem to have the training required of a 5 star resort mainly in regards food service. Lovely spa treatment. Also not that knowledgeable on what options near hotel to eat etc. Was quite noisy too as it is in a suburb, not that flash, so noise of dogs barking and fighting during the night and early morning mosque prayers\n", "\nWe stayed in Tanadewa for 5D4N for our honeymoon.

As my villa is at the middle of the compound, it was surrounded by other villas, thus the view was none to speak of. When I look out of my bedroom the only thing I see is the roof of the next villa below. The best view I had was when I was at the Tanalounge having my breakfast.", "Bedroom was spacious and cosy, there is a jacuzzi function in the bathtub, living area and pool is enclosed with tall walls which makes it private. There is a day bench by the pool for you to relax and enjoy a book. You really would want to spend the entire day at the villa if you can. Pool is about 4m in length so there is more soaking than swimming. Service was prompt and all the staff greets you with a smile when they see you.", "Location wise as Tanadewa is at the Nusa Dua region, it is very far to the famous Kuta beach and other touristy areas in Seminyak. Apparently there is a beach nearer but I did not explore that. Overall my stay at Tanadewa was pleasant and the service was excellent. The only thing that left a bad taste was when I realised that there is a differentiation in the breakfast offered to Groupon vouchers users. Apparently your choice of breakfast was seriously limited to a few items like pancakes and toast or local dishes. Breakfast was passable at best but when I realised that other guests had more selection then I was disappointed.\n", "\nThe villa we stayed in is very big and spacious. It is private and very romantic. We arrived 2 hours earlier than check-in time but was allowed to enter our rooms without fuss. Eventhough the special room arrangements (honeymoon perks) were not ready, the staff did not let this affect our check-in experience. They followed through with the promise and completed the preparations when we were out for dinner. In-room service was very prompt, thoughtful and accommodating. However, the villa is located quite a distance from the beach. Other than location, we had a very good experience in Tanadewa!\n", "\nWe love the rose petals in the jacuzzi and on the bed with the 2 towel swans. Felt very surprised by the thoughtfulness of the villa staff. Everything looks very new. Private pool is great! We miss the salmon for breakfast!\n", "\nTanadewa is a bit like home... If your home included a butler, a living-room with a walk-in private pool, and a jacuzzi in your bathtub, that is! Once inside the luxury private villa, there's really not much reason to step out (though if you do, there's always the complimentary shuttle car to take you to Bali Collection, Nusa Dua, for some retail therapy).", "While this is essentially a place for couples, I was there with my wife and two kids, and we had a great time (especially the kids, who didn't want to get out of the pool).

We stayed at the villa for 5D4N for our honeymoon.The villas are huge and very private with large living cum plunge pool on the first floor and grand bedroom on the second.The only thing which bothered us was cooling of the Air conditioner which was not able to absorb the Bali humidity.Otherwise villa staff were friendly and responsive.Good place to stay if you are on a honeymoon.\n", "\nWe stayed 6-16th May 2014 using Groupon voucher . We loved the modern upstairs downstairs design with gorgeous private pool . The bedroom was enormous and the bathroom and amenities to rival any 5 star facility. It is about 7 mins by car to Bali Connection and Nusa Dua beach or any entertainment but no problem as the free shuttle leaves every two hours. It would be great to have return shuttle but we just booked a Blue Bird metered taxi and showed driver the card with directions supplied by the hotel with no problems, only @ $A3.30 to get back. Also some restaurants in Nusa Dua will collect you and drop you home just ask when you book. Spa treatments devine and we found it very reasonable to eat there which we did a lot which is good because no other places to eat within easy walking distance but transport cheap so no problem. All staff and service fantastic whole stay. We asked for a quiet villa got No 18 which was great as the ones near the road may be a bit noisy. Best bed I've ever slept in! Also loved the coffee machine and included breakfasts (A La Carte). There are three small convenience stores just a couple of minutes away which also sell beer but not wine so bring or get elsewhere. If you want cold drinks the bar fridge won't do unfortunately as not cold enough so just ask your Butler for an esky and ice. Hotel also very kindly let us keep room until 8pm checkout for a reasonable fee as we had a late flight which was a fabulous relief. We came home feeling very relaxed and spoilt by Tanadewa THANK YOU!

The bed was huge, soft and comfy... the couch just at the foot of it, just zaps any motivation that you have built up and hypnotizes you to laze. The huge outdoor couch... the super comfy outdoor pool pad... just oozes out laze, laze and laze some more.", "Cleanliness", "Top notch... thumbs up for the housekeeping crew. Working like ninjas assassinating dirt, dust and trash while you were out...", "Location", "One would be surprised where the villas were... so surprised that even my local contact was unable to find it without verbal directions from the hotel staff on through his phone.

Location and approach is not that great. If you expect more foreigners to visit your place then you should have staff that is fluent in English and have better choices of salads and soups and vegetarian food. Non vegetarian food is outdated and people are health conscious and avoid eating meat while travelling. These days mock meats are available too. Transportation charges are unreasonably high.

Our villa unit consisted of a small private pool and sitting area/bar downstairs and bedroom/bath upstairs.

Credit to the staff who responded immediately to our complaint, but it took them 2 attempts (2 days) to finally resolve the issue. 2) The area where the resort is located is generally quiet, but at 7AM in the mornings we stayed there, there was some amplified chanting (prayer?) going on in the city. Generally, this shouldn't have bothered us at all, but there was a 2-3mm gap between the window frames which allowed this noise to penetrate into our room - this is the reason I've downgraded the \"sleep quality\" rating.", "The unit was nicely furnished and is very comfortable otherwise. The resort is not close to the beach nor close to anything in particular. In fact, you can't really walk from or to the resort from anywhere. The resort provides a shuttle that makes it's round every 2 hours that can drop you off at various points of interest. However, it doesn't have a pickup service, so you will have to call a taxi to get you back to the hotel. We opted to hire a car for the day to drive us around to avoid this inconvenience. The good news is that the beach and Jimbaran aren't that far away.", "The entrance to our unit was along the narrow driveway that leads to the hotel lobby - not a particularly desirable set up.

Relax in the couches or get a slight tan in the daybed right beside the pool in the afternoon sun before trying out some of their pretty decent dishes for lunch. Watch little birds or dragonflies zoom across the plantation while seated in the living area, and take in all that nature has to offer.

Really glad that we have chosen Tanadewa as it was a great stay and experience. The room was amazing, big and comfortable. Upstairs was the bedroom with a large TV and huge jacuzzi bathtub with flower petals in it! The plunge pool downstairs was marvelous and we can have our breakfast served in the villa. On the first day, we could not get to watch the TV.The staff informed us it was due to a windy / storm earlier that day. That night, upon returning to our villa, there was a turn down service made with an apology note about the TV disruption and chocolates on our bed. Thanks for making our day! :)", "Although the place is quite far from the beach, but it was a perfect get-away from the hustle and bustle. The staffs were great and helpful. They help us to rent a motorbike and we went all around Nusa Dua and up to Uluwatu with it. Nice restaurants can be found around Nusa Dua town as well. Be sure to go to Geger Beach if you're in Nusa Dua. You wont regret it as it is a very nice and clean beach. It was a definitely better choice to stay in Nusa Dua instead of Kuta. We regretted for not staying in Tanadewa for the whole duration in Bali as Kuta beach was very dirty and the town itself was very crowded. Will definitely come back to Tanadewa if we're planning our trip to bali again!\n", "\nUpon arrival, it was smiles all around.

So, if you are planning on staying here, bring your own spirits/wine.", "The fridges arent cold enough either, we always had to ask for ice buckets.", "My partner and I got Bali Belly and the Staff were very helpful and assisted us as much as possible.

The 4 of us stayed in the two bedroom villa. We got an amazing view of the Benoa Harbor and we got to see the sunset. The design makes us feel at home but at the same time, it still say that we're in Bali. We get to wake up and have breakfast delivered to our room by the butlers.

Let's just all 4 of us were very pleased with the spa experience, as the staff really knew what they need to do to make us feel what we're supposed to feel in a spa -- indulged and relaxed.

We just pay for it ", "5) The last day we are here, We requested to send us either Kuta or Airport, whichever is cheaper as we plan to stay in Kuta for another one more days, The driver charge us 150000 as he say that from Airport to Kuta Beach is far and much more expensive, We realize later then, the distance from Airport to Kuta Beach is 15minutes drive only, ", "We dont expect for excellent services but looking for genuine services , and we don,t feel it from Tanadewa\n", "\nTanadewa is definitely a hidden gem in Nusa Dua.", "The villa is very new and clean, and we love how bath salts, bubble bath and high quality shower stuff are in place.

Unfortunately, the villa was fully booked that day and we could not even have abit of extension. Which was fine by us, as the staff kindly offered us shower facilities in the gym after we checked-out and before we took the airport transfer.", "The only downside I have to say was a small incident that happened when we were checking out. The staff found that 2 of the hand towels were missing from our villa. We assured them that we did not take them out from the room, but their housekeeping claimed that the towels were missing since the 2 day we were there. I had to open up and ransack my luggage in the lobby, so as to prove that the towels were not mistakenly taken by us (which obviously wasn't in there). I thought the management of this incident could have been done in a more civil manner (it's 2 small towels!!) but I understand that this is part of their job. So no hard feelings!

I recommend the Tanadewa breakfast - high quality execution and excellent presentation.", "Transportation: The driver who took us from the airport and on the day tour was very good. Safe driving and very helpful in general.

The issue we had was that we were told at check in that the transport was every hour. Then we quickly found out that transport is every 2 hours and finishes at 6pm. Not a problem. The problem we had was that the Villa called us a taxi and made a dinner reservation on the first night which was my birthday and we just wanted to go somewhere to celebrate. The first issue was the taxi booked by the Villas had no idea where the restaurant was and drove us around for 30 minutes. We ended up at Bali Collection which was a disaster and to get a hotel back all of the taxis refused to use the meter and wanted to charge us double the price. We had no choice but to pay the price. We complained IMMEDIATELY to the villas when we returned and was told that the taxi service was looking into the situation. However, we never received an answer to the situation. On the second day we wanted to go to Nusa Dua beach to the Opera Beach Club. The SAME situation occurred. The driver didn't know where the Opera beach club was so we just got out of the taxi really angry with the fact that the taxis in the area were trying to screw tourist. On the way back to the villas the same thing occurred trying to get back with the taxi refusing us the meter service so we went and had the Opera beach club staff to call us a taxi.

The pool was quite cold, but refreshing. Definitely no sun though if you're looking to be able to tan. I managed to get a spot on the steps of the pool that got sun for an hour or so, but that was it. Our one complaint was that the beautiful waterfall was SO loud, but we just called to have it shut off and it was no problem. There was a mini bar in the kitchen that even included a few free Bintang, although the fridge was definitely not cold enough for leftover food or cooling down warm drinks. We just ordered ice from our butler and it was no problem. ", "The included breakfasts every day were wonderful and gave us a lot of choice. The salmon is a must-try. We ate both in our room and at the restaurant and it was never a problem either way. They do seem to like it if you can tell them what you'll be having the night before but we never wanted to make that decision until we sat down for breakfast and it didn't seem to be an issue. ", "We had a massage on our last day there and would highly recommend the experience even though it was pricier than most of the other villas we'd stayed in around Bali. These ladies definitely know what they are doing. All around the staff was wonderful, always calling taxis for us and calling to let us know when they had arrived. Booking day trips and drivers and restaurant reservations for us with no fuss. We do have one complaint that was a bother while we were at the villas, which was that we found our butler a little too eager to please. One day we posted the Do Not Disturb sign on our door and were startled later to hear noise downstairs while we were napping. The butler had, presumably, knocked and then entered to start cleaning. He quickly left when we asked him too, but a couple hours later knocked again to ask when he could come clean our room. We left it that we'd skip the room cleaning but would call if we changed our minds. In the evening while we were having drinks at the restaurant he came up to tell us they'd been in our room to clean but had seen money on the bed so they left, he wanted to know if we could put it away so they could clean. We appreciated the honesty, but would have liked to not be bothered all day when we stated we'd like to be left alone (it was our honeymoon after all!) In future, I'd suggest that when the DND sign is up, they call instead of knocking to ask about room cleaning and the like, and even then, keep it to a minimum as Do Not Disturb means we'd like to be left alone. ", "A couple of tips i f you're staying here: Make sure you have a business card with the address whenever you go out so your taxi will know where to take you, we only had one cab driver who knew where this was. Also, at Bali collection there are many unlicensed drivers who will offer to bring you back to your hotel. While I believe they are safe, every time we spoke with one of them they tried to jack the price incredibly. It never cost us more than 2.50 American to get back to the resort so if you do go with these guys, talk them way down. I would just suggest taking a cab as we found them the safest and cheapest option.\n", "\nWe stayed here for two nights and enjoyed every minute. The villa was amazing and so private it was like we were the only ones there. The breakfast was lovely and very filling. We had breakfast brought to our villa on our second morning which was really nice. The location is a little bit out of the way but the villa staff do run a shuttle service into Nusa Dua every couple of hours. The only down side for us was there was no cocktails on the menu. Otherwise perfect.\n", "\nWe stayed at Tanadewa in sept 2013 for 9 nights. Brand new secluded luxurious villas with great amenities like ensuite pool and separate lounge area. We came for our honeymoon and they gave us a proper honeymoon experience. ", "Pros", "Gorgeous resort. Good variety for breakfast. Free shuttle to Nusa dua beach and bali collections shopping area. The staff were extremely helpful with organizing taxis and providing general information. We didn't want the sterile resort experience, and this villa fit the build. ", "Cons", "Not the best location if your looking for nightlife and restaurants within walking distance. However, there is easy access to the main road (bypass) and taxis are very cheap (always use the meter). Also, most activities offer free pick-up and drop-off, or you often end up hiring a driver for the entire day, so this really isn't a big deal. Didn't have an adjoining beach, but they have a free shuttle that takes you there. Activities booked through most hotels are generally overpriced, so shop around for deals and always ask for a discount.\n", "\nTanadewa is a magnificent place to stay whilst holidaying in Bali. It's very clean, surprisingly spacious, with nice ambient and exceptional service. Each room comes with its own private plunge pool, huge bed, universal adaptors, free wifi, and amenities.", "I would highly recommend their spa. It is a tad more expensive than the massages on the main roads of Bali but cheaper than the ones you can find in Australia. Either way it's well worth the money. The staff are very professional and the venue is clean.", "I would highly recommend Tanadewa and would definitely consider staying here on my next visit.\n", "\nOur stay in Tanadewa gave us another memorable experience and more reason to love Bali. The staff were very polite, accommodating, and prompt to attend to our requests. We loved our Villa. The interior is still new and very clean, and one of our favorite spots from the Villa was the living room with private pool and gazebo. One of the highlights of our stay in Tanadewa was the Body Glow massage treatment at the TanaSpa. We had the Earth and Air Massages, which I can say were one of the best massages that we have had. The contracted drivers were helpful, safe, and a welcome option that Tanadewa can arrange. Overall, the staff provided a high level of support, were always welcoming upon return to the Villas, and we would be more than willing to return again.\n", "\nTandewa is an awesome, clean and very private. The villas are very up market. The staff and service is exceptional and the food for breakfast was great. It is not your normal Bali trip with communal pools and beach side living but it's a great place to go if you want a low key, private holiday away from the hustle and bustle of the main tourist areas. I would say that the only downfall I found tandewa to have was that the way the villa was built and positioned, there was not an ounce of sun on the pool or alfresco area, so you couldn't tan. The tanalounge didn't offer any alcoholic cocktails. Just beer and wine. We loved our stay and the value for money and the service and friendly staff made our holiday. It's a 15minute taxi to the main Nusa Dua strip and beaches which we went to everyday. It was ideal as taxi transport is so easy in Bali and at the end of our busy day we could take a quick drive back to Tanadewa and be quiet and private away from all the activity of the main strip resorts. Tandewa is great and pristine 5star accommodation and besides not having sun and in house cocktails I will definitely recommend it.\n", "\nMy friend recommend this villa to me and finally I tried this new villa on my last trip to Bali. My first impression about the property is the location is so conveniently close to everywhere (airport, Jimbaran, Nusa Dua, Tanjung Benoa, etc), the service was great and the villa itself was homey and comfortable. The wifi service is available within the property area and the iPod dock was a nice facility that was provided by the villa. ", "I also tried the massage at the TanaSpa and it was really good. The masseur was really friendly and the spa was clean. The spa my body's element and recommend the suitable massage/spa for me. I tried the Fire massage and I cannot wait to visit the spa for another treatment.\n", "\nStuffing 18 Villas in such small land with one pool per villa is a miracle. Nice architectural ideas where you can enjoy total privacy, intimacy and relaxation. IPod, Bose Sound, three TVs per room make sure you will never get bored while in spa bath, eating in-room breakfast and before you sleep. Service is 5 stars most of the time only one staff fell way behind during our stay. We wanna give special thanks to Adita for his extra effort to make our stay more comfortable and convenient. He seems a smart man who loves learning and always tries to improve himself and his service. ", "Restaurant provides reasonably priced good food but has limited choice. We also enjoyed our first full-Spa experience very much.", "However, as many other reviewers pointed out, the location is not ideal as it is not walkable to anywhere and there is no natural view anywhere except the upper level restaurant which is small and can be a little crowded during peak. Although it is a short drive to Nusa Dua, once we were back in the villa in the late afternoon, we felt lazy to get out again.", "We stayed for 5 nights and paid AUD200 each which is fair. It is a great place for intimate lovers where your whole world is each other, for small friend groups where you can entertain each other and/or if you want to save a few hundred to shop and dine better.", "To improve this villa must make greatest effort to upgrade services and experiences. Better staff training, providing more travel info (with photos/videos) and more regular/flexible shuttle can be a start.\n", "\nThe location isnt in Nusa Dua , its about a 10 minute drive from Nusa Dua , a short taxi ride away , this isnt a problem just dont expect to be anywhere near any restaurants or beach.", "The villa itself is ok , clean but you would expect that it being only a year old , two storey with the bedroom being on the second floor , which is very nice to be honest , i could fault it , the small pool and outside area is downstairs , they do have a problem with Ants but that could be expected with the countryside location , the pool is ok , the main problem i have with the pool area is that there is never any sunlight ,due to the construction of the 2 floors.", "The service was ok , nothing special , to be honest would i stay again , no , there is better places to stay in Bali , but given the price i paid i got value for money ($170 + tax) , if the rate was $200+ i would advise looking elsewhere.\n", "\nThe villa is awesomely gorgeous! it is a two stories villa with a private pool, we enjoy the privacy and the excellent service of the staffs. ", "We have trouble to withdraw cash from the ATM while we were in Bali, after trying almost every single ATM around Kuta, Kerobokan and Legian, still our efforts is to no avail. Thanks God that the staffs of tanadewa manage to sort our problem by lending us cash which we reimburse back using our credit card.If not because of their help, we wont be having enough cash to pay the cabs", "Thanks to the staff namely Adit for helping us to buy reload coupon, and also to Agus who go an extra mile sending us to Jimbaran Mcd for us to get foods as it is midnight and the villa's kitchen had already close", "The villa definitely worth it, from the room facilities, the nice foods to the excellent service and hospitality.I will definitely return!\n", "\nThe villas at this hotel are gorgeous. Two stories with a living area and a swimming pool downstairs. Nice touches like an iPod with preloaded music and TV's above the jacuzzi in the bathroom and above the swimming pool downstairs. We were aware that we would not be staying at the beach at this hotel -- it's just a short drive from Jimbaran, Nusa Dua, and Tanjun Benoa; however, we wish the staff had better and more specific recommendations for places to sit out at the beach. The hotel should consider developing a relationship with one of the beach-front properties so that guests can use those facilities.\n", "\nWe stayed for five nights and it was exactly what we were looking for. Away from Kuta and the hussle and bussle. Easy taxi ride to Nusa Dua, the airport or Kuta if needed. There's a minimart just 100m down the road for little bits and pieces. Apart from the gorgeous private villa with your own cabana and pool and the uniquely beautiful view of Bali from the bar/lounge balcony, the thing that sets this place apart are the staff. Everyone is so wonderful and they make a point of knowing your name and have such genuine smiles for you every time you meet. We had a little case of miscommunication on our car from the airport, and while this didn't bother us at all (I didn't read the email properly) we arrived back to our villa to find a lovely letter and some very yummy chocolates awaiting us :) its these little touches that make me highly recommend Tanadewa for a romantic getaway with someone special.\n", "\nI've a memorable time with my honey during stay at Tanadewa. It's worth to choosing this hotel, such as the excellent serivce, the Spa and massage, breakfast, the room facilities,and the view quite good.\n", "\nThis place almost ticked every box. We stayed there for 8 nights and really loved our Villa and the staff were super attentive. The villas are just beautiful. I did not really care about the sun issue as we are both fair skinned it suited us well to lay in the sun. The food was great and the view from the lounge was very nice too. The only negative for us was the location, we would probably have been better to stay in seminyak because it had all the dining and nightlife we enjoy. However as it was our first time to Bali we didn't really know. The Villas are not really close to much, you have convenience stores ect close by but if you wanted food outside of the villa you do have to do your research and you will have to get a cab. Anyway, I would highly recommend this place if you plan on just lazing about your villa and catching up on some rest while drinking a wine and reading a new book, or if you really just want to relax and not do much :)\n", "\nThe villa and facilities are absolutely superb. The plunge pool was refreshing and large enough to swim in. Please note that due to the design,the sun in your pool area is limited so you will have to go to the beach to do some sunbathing.The villa itself was very private although we did experience road noise as our villa was next to the road. Make sure you don't get Villa number 1. We were also disappointed to hear screaming noises from children as when we booked, the villas stated no children allowed but this clearly was not the case. We had breakfast served in the villa which was of a very good quality. We did eat once in the restaurant which was ok. The service throughout was excellent and our butler was extremely attentive without being obtrusive. The big minus was the location of the villas. Although we knew there was not any beach nearby, the villas are also a distance from Nusa Dua and the restaurants too so taxis were very much needed. The villas did advertise a shuttle service but this was never in service apart from the first night when we were given a thankful lift to a restaurant, unfortunately not a great one! As the villa was in soft opening, and therefore a very good price we did think we got value for money hence 4 stars although I would give it 3.5 if I was able.\n", "\nwe stayed for 3 nights at the end of July and we really loved it!!!! the villa is very clean and there is wifi even in the room!It is a wonderful place to relax!! the pool is clean but a little bit cool in the evening ! the staff is very friendly and polite, there is also a tasty welcome drink! it is almost 10 minutes from Nusa Dua by taxi.. Also it is close to Kuta and Denpasar Airport. The restaurant has a beautiful view of the south part of the island and the food is tasty! ", "We really recommend this hotel for your stay in Bali!!!\n", "\nthe villa is very new, the bathroom is awesome you can watch tv while taking a bath. we stayed 3 nights and because on second day my wife got sick so we can't go anywhere. we always ordered the food and it's nice (must try tanadewa breakfast). in the morning my wife can't eat anything, we asked the butler to prepare a bowl of porridge (this is not listed on their menu) and they can provide it quickly with very good taste too (maybe you can put this in your breakfast menu coz the taste is very good). i also asked my butler to go to drug store and buy some medicine and he can do it very quick and he was happy to do it. overall we really enjoy stay in Tanadewa and sure will go back again.\n", "\nWe stayed for 4 nights and had a really good time. The pool villa has lots of space, nice interior design and is very clean. The plunge poo, is good to refresh yourself, but you won't get to sunbath in your poolvilla. For that you will have to go somewhere else, also because there is not much community space at tanadewa. To go to a beach you will haveto take a taxi which takes a minimum of 15 mins. The people working in tanadewa are really friendly and they respect your privacy, The food was absolutely ok but nothing special. One day we wanted to go to the spa and at the reception they told us, it is open until 9pm, but when we came back around 5pm it was already closed. Tanadewa is still in soft openeing, but if you carry \"spa\" in your name, then you should provide full service. In a nutshell, if you want to have an awsome pool villa to have some privacy this is the place, but nevertheless if you want to sunbath or go to the beach the location of tanadewa is just not good enough, it is up to you.\n", "\nWe stayed 3 nights in a 1 bedroom pool villa and very impressed with the decor, layout, and cleanliness. Although it was our first time in Bali, we ventured out only late afternoons and evenings - it was just so relaxing to wade around in the pool and generally laze about. Only the day we were leaving did we realize that they have a great sunset view from their lounge area. The staff was great and very friendly. It helped that we were traveling with our infant baby - they just love babies in Bali! The food was good too - not the best we had in Bali, but nevertheless very good. Nice touch with the complimentary drinks in the minibar. Agreed that it may not be right by the beach, but if you need privacy and a relaxing time, can't get any better than this. If we are staying around the same area the next time we visit Bali, we would definitely want to stay here again.\n", "\nMy boyfriend and I stayed at the Tanadewa for 4 nights over my birthday and had a fantastic time, it was our first trip to Bali and We would have loved to stay longer and loved the villa and the spa. The location is inbetween Two towns so it did require taxis but the hotel manager kindly gave us a lift on our first evening. We had the 3 hr treatments at the spa and had room service a few times for lunch and snacks. Loved the feel of the place and has lovely touches such as welcome drink on arrival and very attentive staff, the only drawback was that we booked a specific tour with the hotel and we had to tell the driver what was on the list of places we were ment to visit, it would have been alot cheaper if we had of organised it ourselves. Throughly reccomend this villa and spa :)\n", "\nWe stayed 5days/4nights here and this was one of the highlights of our trip. It was beautiful, quiet, clean, relaxing and had the privacy we needed. The room and bathroom was very spacious, beddings were excellent and the amenities were first rate. What added to the ambience was a Bose ipod dock where we could play our own music. We were provided robes, well made native slippers and even a beach bag. The towels were thick and lush, floor terry mats were folded with a flair, and toiletries were even packed in an eco-friendly manner. A personalised welcome note greeted us in our room but not before being served a very refreshing welcome drink at the reception area. ", "I made several requests weeks before we even arrived at the hotel. Management readily acceded to my requests of an early check in and balloons in our room. ", "Our room was always cleaned despite our forgetting to always put the \"make up room\" sign. Front desk made reservations for us in the restaurants of our choice and arranged for a reasonably rated car rental.", "Breakfast was served at our villa at our convenient time. The mini-bar area also had a drawerful of utensils, had complimentary bottled water/beer/soda. It even had its own coffee maker and kettle. A small microwave or toaster would have been convenient too.", "While the food was good at the Tanalounge, its selection was quite limited. There should be a \"daily special\" or \"catch of the day\" so that longer staying guests could have variety in the menu. ", "The day bed by the pool had a wooden tray which included two towels, sunblock and a natural insect repellant spray. ", "We booked for a 90 minute massage in the spa. It was alright but even with the 20% in-house guest discount, I still found it a bit expensive because for the same service, we paid 35% less at a different hotel. ", "All in all, I highly recommend this property and will definitely stay here given another opportunity to visit Bali.\n", "\nThis was my first visit to Bali and my partner's second. I chose this venue based on reviews by other Trip Advisor members and was not disappointed. We wanted a honeymoon before we get married and this venue was perfect for our needs and I would highly recommend it to anyone on their real honeymoon - it is just gorgeous and very very private. ", "Location - You should note that Tanadewa Villas are not located in the Nusa Dua resort area, they are about 10 minutes drive from that area, where most of the Nusa Dua resorts are. If you want to be able to walk out of your room and see sights or go to shops this is not the place for you - not that this worried us at all. Taxis are very cheap and easy to get and can take you wherever you want to go. We went for a walk to the Mini Mart to get coke etc. on our first morning and it was an event - the road is crazy and very hard to cross - but it was part of the experience. When we got back the staff at Tanadewa were worried about us crossing the road and suggested we should get a taxi in the future - we agreed, it is a dangerous road to cross! They do offer a transfer service a couple of times per day into Nusa Dua and we used this once.", "I was very worried when we arrived as the villa is amongst busy streets and dirty areas (just Bali really) but once you drive into the villa property all of that is a world away. You don't hear ANY road noise inside the villa and you could be anywhere in the world.", "Villa - The villa is just beautiful - amazing doesn't do it justice. You could stay in here and never go anywhere else. We loved it and agree with all of the other positive reviews about the actual villa. Very roomy, upstairs has air conditioner which works well and ensures a good night's sleep in the huge bed. We had our god daughter stay with us for a few days of our holiday and they provided a pull out bed for her for a small extra fee. ", "Downstairs has the pool and a cold outdoor shower and a ceiling fan, small fridge and sink etc. The pool has a water feature which you can ask to turn off if you want as it is a little noisy. Knowing that you have a private pool to jump in after a busy, hot Bali day of touring is great and we certainly got our money's worth from the pool.", "Restaurant - We ate at the restaurant and also had room service and we were not disappointed by any of the food. The Nasi Goreng in the restaurant was the best we had on the Island. We also did a couple of day trip/tours leaving early from the resort and asked for take away breakfast which was happily accommodated, with boiled eggs, pastries and fruit delivered in little boxes for us to take, along with a bottle of water each. The breakfast which is included in the rate is second to none and was a lovely way to start each day. The restaurant and room service food is very reasonably priced compared to other resorts.", "I think what sets this place apart from others, excluding the beauty of the villa itself, was the service of the staff at Tanadewa. They would do anything to assist you and make sure you have a happy holiday. They were kind and so very polite. I disagree with those that complain about the language barrier. We were always able to explain ourselves and understand what was being said, even if we might have to repeat it once or twice - but we should remember we are going to enjoy a non English-speaking country so we should expect some language barriers - its part of the fun!", "We completely disagree with the couple who gave this a low score - its like they were in a different place. Other than the fact that you can't walk to see things, this place cannot be faulted. We didn't go to the beach so can't comment on this.", "Some tips:", "Put the address of the villa in your phone in full. Many taxi drivers do not know where Tanadewa is because it is so new and if you say Nusa Dua they think the resort area. Tell taxi drivers its in Mumbul and then show the address - this saves confusion. ", "You can order the welcome drink any time - we had one with every meal, it is the most refreshing, yummy drink in Bali. ", "Overall, highly recommend staying at Tanadewa at the price we paid, which was the special deal of around $250 AU per night.\n", "\nMy husband, myself & our 6 month old son thoroughly enjoyed our stay at tanadewa. We stayed 7 days in a 1 bedroom pool villa which was absolutely beautiful. As we had our little one with us so we had all our meals served in our villa which was very convenient and nice and private too. There is a choice of breakfasts both western and Indonesian so you could have a bit of variety if you stay a few nights. We also ate mostly dinners from there room service menu and really enjoyed almost everything we tried. One thing you cannot fault tanadewa on is there service which was impeccable and always friendly. They were always more than happy to drop us in to the nusa dua markets or Bali collection which made up for not being inside the nusa dua enclave.During our stay I experienced one of the many spa treatments on offer and thoroughly enjoyed it. The presentation of the spa and the treatment were of a 5star level. Most of all what made our stay were how the staff were more than happy to have our son stay aswell though we had to bring our own porta cot. Thank you tanadewa for a lovely holiday.\n", "\nStayed for three nights with my girlfriend. Having explored nusa dua and the neighbour\u0131ing areas, we were convinced to have made the right choice. Though the hotel is close to the city and not to the beach ( this took us by surprise) it is veeery calm. You won't hear the traffic or else. Nice view from room and restaurant. The villa concept is really good. Bed and bathroom upstairs, private pool and lounge downstairs. Real private, with coffee machine and mini bar. It's lacking some sun during the day, but that's fine. In room dining and restaurant was very delicious. Enjoyed the SPA too. ", "Downside: the personnel is not very fluent in English. They could not provide a list of recommended things to do. ", "In case we would visit Bali again, which we won't - we definitely would stay here again. Staying in one of the resorts at beach area will not give you the privacy.\n", "\nI booked Tanadewa based on the previous reviews of Tripadvisor and I am definitely happy that I did. My fiancee and I needed a trip away and Tanadewa was the perfect little retreat to do so. Let me break the review down - ", "Location", "Tanadewa is situated in Nusa Dua but it is not in the typical tourist area of Nusa Dua. In fact, it is about half way between the airport and the busy section of Nusa Dua. It is a well hidden gem situated off a laneway connected to a main road. There is nothing nearby (other than a few convenience stores and an expensive spa) so to get anywhere, you will need to book a taxi - note that the hotel does not offer a transport service. This location was perfect for us as we didn't want to deal with local vendors, other tourists walking past or even the loud noise of local traffic. Note, a taxi to Kuta is only $5 (50,000Rp).", "Villa", "We stayed in a one bedroom villa and we loved it. The villa should actually be called a \"One HUGE bedroom Villa\" because that is what you get. Upstairs (and behind a door that can be locked) is your room with separate ensuite that has great amenities and large towels. Inside your room is one mega bed that could probably sleep a family of 4 comfortably. You can open the curtains and sliding door (no balcony) for a bit of sun action and a closed in view of the pool downstairs. When you enter the villa, you can go downstairs where you will find a private plunge pool (with fountain) along with a bit of alfresco area that has couches, tv, fridge and sink. The fridge (I'm told) runs on ammonia so never did get the drinks as cold as I'd like but the staff were awesome in delivering a bucket with ice each day (sometimes more often) to keep our drinks icy cold. One thing to note is that there is minimal area to lie down and sunbake but with a bit of luck (and good weather), you can put your pool towel down and get about 1 - 2hrs of sun which is all a typical westerner would need :) Suffice to say, the villas were awesome and very private which we enjoyed! Oh, the staff only enter through a service door so this is great for security reasons (of course they ring a bell and knock before you need to let them enter).", "Restaurant", "The \"lounge\" is located above the reception area. We had room service once and the food was fantastic as well as on the cheap side compared to some places. Each villa comes with breakfast included and you get a choice of 4 - American brekky (eggs & bacon/sausage), Continental (cereal/toast), Indonesian (Nasi/Mie Goreng) or Tanadewa (salmon steak &* potatoes). I tried all but the continental brekky (who wants to eat cereal on holidays??) and they were amazing. Along with the main portion, you get croissant/danish, a juice, fresh fruit and coffee/tea. The breakfast is not all you can eat but it is more than enough for the average person to kick start your day! Seriously, try the Tanadewa brekky one morning!", "Gym", "We used the gym twice during our stay and it is perfect if you feel like burning some calories one morning. It is a boutique hotel so if you expect to come to some eco retreat where you want to work out for 4hrs each day then this is not the place. It has a treadmill, cross trainer and a set of dumbells (up to 10kg each) - perfect for someone who just wants to throw in a few sets or run on the treadmill for 15mins.", "Spa", "We did not use the in-house spa but the menu looks fantastic. There is a cheaper spa just down on the main road but again, it is $30USD for a 1hr massage which is way too expensive for a spa treatment outside of your hotel. Ha, go into Kuta and get a 1hr treatment for $10. If you're really stretching the budget we found a place in Tanjung Benoa (next to Meads in Bali) that did the both of us for $10 total!!", "Service", "The staff were fantastic and always smiling and willing to help. Some of them have limited English skills but when you come to Bali, it is not London so you need to expect some (if not most) only have limited English speaking skills. Having said that, the staff were amazing in making our stay comfortable and were always helpful in booking taxis, taking our brekky order or coming to make up our rooms.", "All in all, this place is fantastic for those who want to get away from Kuta, Legian, Seminyak or even Nusa Dua. It is a private little boutique hotel that offers quality service (with a smile). We will definitely consider coming back again.", "Please note that we got our villa on a deal so for the price we paid, it was fantastic.\n", "\nThe title says it all, doesn't it? The service was impeccable. They tended to my every whim and treated me like I was a VIP. Everything from the airport to the hotel were carefully planned and it was stress-free. I arrived there and immediately took a bubble bath. The food was great, especially the Tanadewa breakfast. The view from the Tanalounge was so beautiful I bombarded my friends with panoramic pictures of it! I would definitely stay again. Such a wonderful place. You will always get a genuine smile from the workers there. I would give them 6 stars if it was possible! Truly the Balinese experience.\n", "\nLove the outlook of our villa. It has 2 floors and it is secluded and with complete privacy. A great way to get away from the city life. There is basically nothing much to do except dipping in the pool, drinking lots of beer, watching TV, soaking in the jacuzzi/bathtub and maybe rolling around on the huge bed. The bedroom is so huge, we could practically do cartwheels in it. ", "A great villa for people looking to just slack and do nothing all day. If you want to see Bali, this would not really be an ideal choice as its location is quite out of the way and there isn't anything nearby.", "The room service was excellent! Absolutely love our butler, he is the friendliest and the most helpful staff around. Food was not bad and served to our villa at our preferred time. Room service prices are really reasonable as well. Would definitely head back for a getaway in future!\n", "\nWe stayed in this villa for 5 nights during our honeymoon and it we were really amazed by the level of service provided by the staff. Upon entering the entrance of the villa, you can totally feel at ease with the security of the villa. The experience we had were really exclusive, with no loud disturbance anywhere. ", "The level of service was impeccable. We shared some of our meal preference on the second day after the breakfast was served, and they took notice and followed through throughout our stay. Most of the staff know us by name by the second day, which I think really made us feel welcome. We even enquired if they can help us purchase the passion fruit in bulk from their supplier (we thought it was really nice and wanted to bring it back home for our family and friends to try), and they manage to delivery to purchase more passion fruit at supplier prices (without jacking up the price, which we initially thought they would, the cost was less that half if we would have bought it from outside supermarket).", "Only downside was the location as we perceived it to be rather inaccessible, although taxi (only take the bluebird taxi - identified by the make and model of the car Toyota Vios) will can bring us around at a fairly decent price.", "Overall, we were very impressed and will surely recommend the villaf and will highly rate them for couples looking for a time of retreat exclusively for just the both of you! ", "\n", "\nWe stayed for Seven nights and loved it! The service was fantastic the villa itself was beautiful. The bedroom is gorgeous and the bathroom is clean and spacious , we loved having a spa bath and watching the cute little tv in there. The villa was always sparkling clean whenever we got back from an outing especially the pool. The linen and towels are of a five star standard which we have not really found in other places in Bali. The staff are so friendly and welcoming also go above and beyond to be helpful. We would recommend these Villas for anyone who was wanting some peace, quiet and privacy. The only downside is the tiny fridge that is not very cold however the staff were always helpful with ice for keeping drinks cold. As far price is concerned the villa is value for money the services are expensive in Bali terms ( ie transfer to airport and laundry) also alcohol was very expensive but food is very good and reasonably priced. In saying that though we would definitely stay again.\n", "\nOn arrival of our 6 day stay ,we were met by courteous friendly staff who continued the treatment throughout. The villas were not only spacious but very tastefully appointed.After a day of exploring shopping or beaching it was a pure delight to return to the villa for a plunge in the private pool or a relaxing massage at the spa.You do not walk out of the villas into a shopping or restaraunt area , however in saying that,a call to the desk and a taxi,scooter or private driver is arranged with ease.This place is private and secure,we found the breakfast choice more than adequate.If you need a place to relax and recharge you batteries Tanadewa ticks all the boxes.\n", "\nAs I planned stay 3 nights with my dearest wife in Tanadewa, end up with change of plan taking my 3 youngster sons for the trip instead. I informed the villa for additional extra bed, they have it with no problem at all. They even give me the breakfast for four without additional charge, Choose Tanadewa breakfast, it is yummiest among others.", "The villa is new, nicely build for the comfort and warm homy feeling. Me and my kids just love it being inside the villa after day activities. Not to mentioned that the villa is very romantic for those who come just with the partner. But I personally think this villa is not design for a whole day stay in enjoyment, a place for relaxing before end your day is a perfect set.", "To make short, this place definitely very recommended for you to stay and yes I would back again someday.\n", "\nMy review will be based on the rating categories that are given by tripadvisor:", "Service: ", "Excellent. The staff are very hardworking, friendly and immaculately atttired. One or two of the staff have a slightly poorer command of English which means you have to repeat yourself a few times before you are understood. Other than that, their attitude was excellent.

Bed was comfortable. Air-conditioning mitigated the heat and humidity of Bali. ", "Cleanliness:", "Excellent. It is a new lodge which is well maintained. ", "Location:", "Not good at all. Far from shops/beaches/restaurants. Was expecting it to be in a romantic hillside but although it was on a hillside, the location was far from romantic. It is about a 15 minute drive from Nusa Dua beach and 20 minutes from Tanjong Benoa. Jimbaran Beach is about 25 minutes away. ", "Rooms:", "Superb. Clean, well appointed, excellent fixtures (Groehe, Kohler etc) and very well thought through. There were enough electrical plugs to charge the many electronic devices that the modern traveller has. A few of the sockets served as multi-plug adaptors which is always useful. Although the villas were side by side, they somehow managed to achieve a high level or privacy. Toilets were very well designed with a stand-up shower, seperate toilet and a bath tub with a jacuzzi function. Perhaps the only thing lacking in the bathroom was that there was only one hook to hang your towel. Rooms had a flat screen TV and a bose I-Pod docking station. Nice wooden floors. The living area downstairs was equally comfortable with a pool, sun bed, outdoor shower, sitting area, dining area and kitchen counter with a coffee machine. Almost flawless if you asked me. ", "Restaurant:", "Did not eat at the restaurant but the breakfast was average at best. The breadrolls were not very good. The Indonesian breakfast was the best option but on the last morning we skipped the breakfast altogether. ", "Spa:", "Loved it. My wife and myself were so well taken care of. Although the spa was merely a converted room, there was nothing wrong with it at all. The two girls are the spa were so polite hospitable it was unbelievable. We had the three hour romantic package which I enjoyed thoroughly.\n", "\nIt's always a challenge being the first to write a less than glowing review. We booked and paid for 7 nights at Tanadewa and checked out after 3, cutting our losses. The positives: the bedroom was modern, good technology, well furnished, very comfortable bed and quality linen. The staff tried hard and were always very pleasant. On the flip side, if you are expecting a spa you will be disappointed. The spa is one of the villas with the bed removed and massage tables instead, without full time staff and limited treatments available (eg no manicure or pedicure). Apart from the small breakfast room/lounge there are no common areas to sit and relax on this property; the gym is a glass bowl with three machines so you tend to stay in your room (as the resort is, as previously noted by reviewers, in the middle of a not very pleasant area). The living/pool area of your room is very private, however is a bit like being in a cave as you have no outlook and it is small - we had a serious case of cabin fever after a couple of days. A little surprised by the glowing comments about the food; our experience was stale pastries for breakfast and hot food was generally lukewarm when it arrived. We spoke to e manager about our concerns and she was very gracious, accepting that there needs to be a common area for guests to relax. We also felt that as the hotel is still in soft opening phase there needs to be more training for their lovely staff to help them deliver.

Really friendly staff. Romantic ambience, really private. The best food (breakfast & dinner) we had during our 3-week stay in Bali, though when I ordered grilled chicken, I got served fried chicken instead :p Nice night view from the lounge. Location might not be so practical as it is a bit up on a hill, outside the Nusa Dua BDTC complex, but I read that they offer free transfer to Nusa Dua beach. The fridge is not cold enough to cool the drinks and as the villa has a tiny garden with exposed soil (no grass/stones) by the living room sometimes we saw centipedes downstairs, hopefully they have done something about these things. Would definitely go back the next time we are in Bali again.\n", "\nWe really love this place...my hubby said \"feels like home\"...they set our bedroom very nice...great service, the staff very friendly and helpful...the breakfast was great, i really like sambal they've made...overall this place so amazing...we really love to come back soon....\n", "\nWonderful hotel.

Each room has two sections. You can curl up in the well equipped bedroom upstairs which has a large size LED TV with all the cable channels you want. There is also a Bose iPod/iPhone dock that sounds very clear and crisp.

An exquisite coffee maker with signature coffees you can choose from or even tea if you don't fancy coffee can be found here. The mini bar is stocked with beer, juices and sodas. Sitting here reading a book was so relaxing as the air was clean and soothing. Next to this was a private pool which made it so convenient to swim privately.

They will bring the food into your villa making it very convenient was well as allowing you to dine privately. Anything you need will be attended to by the friendly and well spoken (English) staff. Before I forget, when you get to the room they will take the time to explain to you about the room facilities as well as the services the villa provides.

You firstly answer a few questions to determine what type of massage style suits you and it was really a very remarkable experience which you hardly get elsewhere.

The rooms are brand new, so everything is in tip-top condition. The beds are sooo comfy and everything is elegantly designed. I really liked that there is an iPod dock for us to play our music and a coffee maker, it's the little touches that make the villa felt a little bit like home away from home. The location was also perfect, it's not right by the beach but it never took too long for us to get anywhere.", "Service", "Tanadewa's service was impeccable. The check-in process was smooth and quick, the welcome drink was delicious. The staff was very knowledgable when he explained the features of our villa to us. I loved how polite everyone was, and that no request were too difficult for them. Twice we wanted to have breakfast in our villa and they delivered those always right on time. And they even set up the table perfectly for us. They also clean our rooms twice a day, which is great. It's an unexplainable luxury to return to a perfectly cleaned and tidied villa after a whole day of exploring Bali.", "Spa", "We tried the tanaspa signature massage, which I found very interesting. Basically they first ask you a few questions to determine your personality (whether you are Fire, Air, Water or Earth). The element you lack is the element that the massage will concentrate on. I did the Water massage for 90 minutes and it was so relaxing that I slept through about three quarters of it. The ambience of the spa is perfect - quiet, breezy, everything you'd want during a pampering spa treatment. I especially liked that at the end, they served us some tea and a small snack to enjoy by the lounge bed next to the spa pool.", "Upon leaving, we were sad to go and leave the tranquil haven that Tanadewa had provided for us.

Although there are only 2 restaurants, the food is fantastic and price is affordable.

The pick up from the airport was seemless despite it being complicated by the fact that 2 of my travelling companions were not staying at the resort but only coming for dinner. The reception at the resort was exemplary and welcoming. The villa itself cannot be faulted. Immaculate, luxurious comes to mind. A large private pool, superb outdoor bath and shower. Without question amongst the finest of its type. The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and accomodating. Now to the only downside...the food is not the best...breakfast was included at that was absolutely fine. We had dinner the first evening at Ru Yi, the Chinese restaurant..it was good but without being anything exceptional. The biggest issue was room service...my guests came back the following day to spend time before flying out in the evening to Europe...we ordered lunch and frankly it was terrible...the food was stone cold when it arrived and was sent back...the replacement was marginally better. Over the next few days I resorted to ordering my food well done in the hope that it would be warm when it arrived and that only just worked!... however please do not let that retract from the fact that Awarta is a luxurious and stylish resort which I would have no hesitation visiting again.\n", "\nI have just returned from our stay at Awarta and I must say I have never regretted one moment choosing this place.", "First of all the villa is beautiful with up-to-date amenities.

We never got tired of the food there. Ruyi restaurant which served chinese food is authentic and delicious.", "Awarta is just about 20 to 30 minutes from the airport which I feel is very convenient. Bali Collection which is the main hub for shops and restaurants is about a 15 minute leisurely walk but you can always ask the villa to send you there via their transport and pick you up after you are done. Very convenient. It is also a 10 minute walk to the beach. We had an adventure trying to look for the route, it is a narrow path between Club Med and Sofitel (so now you know). We felt very safe during our entire stay. Awarta takes care in ensuring their guests safety. In fact the whole of Nusa Dua feels calm and serene as opposed to the busy Kuta.", "I think what made this stay extra special are the amazing staff they have. Resa, Made, Bayu, Ayu and countless others (I'm so sorry if we forgot your names) took time to get to know us and make us feel truly welcomed.

It by far has exceeded any resort that I have ever stayed at over the last 20 years. I prefer staying in Nusa Dua for obvious reasons. The location of Awarta is perfect as it is much more private than the other resorts in the Nusa Dua area. The accommodations are immaculate and the staff and service is unmatched to any other property in Bali, They also have a private beach club and complimentary transportation in luxury coaches. The on site restaurants offer some of the best food choices available, and even of the restaurants is open 24hrs. I think the staff at Awarta make the experience extra special. All of them go above and beyond with any needs that you may have. The entire experience was a 6 star experience and I look forward to returning to Bali and especially to the Awarta Nusa Dua.\n", "\nWe stayed at this one of a kind hotel on two occasions in the past two months and found it faultless with perfect service and the best villa experience we have ever encountered anywhere let alone Bali.The SPA is at the best level in Indonesia and the Chinese restaurant is the best in Bali.\n", "\nfor the very first time i had the opportunity to be treated as a princess over a weekend....", "fantastic private and secular place in nusa dua , people are so friendly and make you confortable upon arrival. the villa is big with a large pool.", "breafest is a la carte and we try itt at the restaurant and in the vilka.

", "For you that want to have private quality time with your love one and family, this is the right place!!\n", "\nI've been hopping around villas or resorts in Bali and I have to say that this is the best one! The service of the private butler was very very special, the privacy of the villa was perfect, the food recommended highly is the chinese one, and other asian foods.. oh my why haven;t I know this place before! The spa was heavenly.. we chose the couple treatment no other description for it. My husband and I loved the spacious private villa with our very own private pool, feels like another honeymoon for me!\n", "\nSpent wonderful gateway weekend at Awarta villa. Located at BTDC area, just next to the convention hall, but still very private and very quiet. Surrounding by amazing garden. We had very delicious Chinese food for dinner, and it is very original. The nite was amazing in our perfect huge room with very generous pool, small kitchen with illy coffee machine. Amazing. The bfast at long table restaurant, was amazing. Fresh homemade croissants specially, make us feel like in Paris. During kids enjoyed the private pool in our villa, mom enjoyed the very Exclusive SPA. All around, Awarta Villa is very recommended. Best weekend gateway in Bali we ever had.\n", "\nOur family stayed at the amazing Awarta Villas for two nights. The property is simply magnificent in regards to the decor and the brilliant attention of the staff. Awarta is truly a hidden Jem in Nusa Dua. The private beachclub with a large grass area is the perfect place to relax and access the water sports of Benoa. Our dining experiences at Awarta were all fantastic. We look forward to visiting again!\n", "\nAs a working couple, we really crave and enjoy a relaxing vacation together. We were so much welcomed from the beginning of our arrival at Awarta till the last day of our stay there. The one-bedroom villa which we stayed in is outstandingly equipped and taken care of and we hardly found any flaw in its facilities. Everything we enjoyed in the compound just made us reluctant to go out, but to indulge ourselves more there, especially in the restaurants and the spa. Coming back there is for sure,,,\n", "\nAwarta is not just an ordinary getaway place, it was meant for something more. A place where kindness was its priority and bringing joy and happiness to all its customers. As i stayed in awarta villas with my friends for 4 days, it was the most memorable time i could ever asked for in Bali. There maybe alot of other villas in Nusa Dua , but i can assure that Awarta is like no other. When the motto comes, customers comes first , they treated us like we are the president or somewhat very important person. Things come and go but the memories and joy that awarta villa has given me will always stay with me. A 5 star place providing luxurious foods and the best services you could ever imagine on Bali. Its heaven on earth. If you dont believe me please render yourself to enjoy a pleasant stay in Awarta.\n", "\nWe stayed at Awarta for 2 nights, looking for some serenity and we were not disappointed. The resort is so peaceful despite a large number of villas, you don\u2019t even hear any noise from you villa. The villa we stayed in was spacious and comfy, well decorated with authentic Chinese arts but nothing kitschy. We \u2018ve been happily surprised by the size of our pool and the lushly garden so well maintained.", "On our 2nd day we indulge ourselves at the spa, in a one of the private room for 2, with a \u201dPot Garam\u201d treatment (hot pot filled with sea salt and spices) that has been a great relaxing moment. The staff was very professional, whispering during the treatment, giving just enough information without bothering us. And all in a perfect English! The music surrounding was at the perfect volume and the lighting dimmed perfectly. We loved the spa interior too, which calm you down as soon as you get in.", "The food at the Chinese restaurant was good enough, very traditional but could, maybe, be a bit more creative. The Shanghai 1930\u2019s d\u00e9cor is spot on, with once again beautiful handicraft. The service was attentive, smiley staff with decent menu knowledge. A good value for money.", "If you are looking to be totally disconnected from your busy life, this is the place to be!\n", "\nMy stay at Awarta was simply amazing. My friends and I stayed at the three bedroom villa with a living room (and a small kitchen) and had our own pool. The room maintenance is excellent, they check and tidied our room a number of times during the day. The room service is also really great, there are vast delicious meals.The staffs are all very friendly and polite. We are given excellent accommodations. There is also a spa in the resort that adds on to the great relaxing experience. I really couldn\u2019t add more to all the positive reviews already present because they are all true.", "Overall, it was a fantastic experience. The point of our visit was to relax and have crazy fun and we earned way more than that. I really couldn\u2019t have asked for a better retreat.\n", "\nWhen we reached the place i could not but help to say wow all the time, the people there are so friendly and helpful and the place looks and is amazing. We were welcomed by fresh delicious drinks and cold towels, just the thing you need to beat the Bali heat. On our way to the villa was a path of great greenery and it looked like it is really well groomed and taken care of. The villa i stayed in is simply wonderful, we got a nice swimming pool and a front row seat to get a nice tan, or at night, to see the beautiful stars of Bali and in the inside the beds and the pillows are like heaven. The cleanliness of this place is sublime, every time i leave the villa , i always come back to see my dirty laundry that are on the floor ,tidied and neatly folded on my bed and the whole villa was like new again every time we came back. The services is one of the best as well, anything you need at anytime will be satisfied by them with a smile all the time and it did not take much time, everything is done so quickly and professionally. Culinary? Check! The food there was also one of the highlights of my Bali trip,I highly recommend the Asian food, i never liked vegetables until i ate the food they made there which are also presented in an exquisite way, instagram worthy.", "So far this place never fails to amuse me, i must say it is the best place to stay in Bali, it is worth all the spend there, its like heaven and there is no other place you'd rather be. No exaggeration.\n", "\nWhen you stay in a villa in bali, you are not renting a room just to sleep for a night. A villa is not a place, it is an experience. Awarta villas approves my definition of a villa. not only they provide luxurious spacious rooms with complete, thoughtful facilities and compliments, they gave me a complete experience.", "from the moment you reach, when the polite staff greets you and brings you to your room. to when you are eating brunch at the long table restaurant (restaurant inside the villa) you get to enjoy the relaxing atmosphere not every place has to offer. If you're looking for a peaceful and serene holiday getaway, Awarta villas is the place to go.\n", "\nI stayed for 3 days and the place was so nice. When i first entered the resort staffs were so friendly and they provided all the comfort me and my friend needed. The Villa has everything, free wifi, swimming pool, COLD AC and a perfect environment to chill and enjoy the BALI VIBE. The food was literally worth the price, it was amazing. Me and my friends really enjoyed staying here. It is one of the Best villa In BALI! LOVED staying here.\n", "\nstayed for 4 days, not only do they have the best facilities their service were on point. friendly and very welcoming, great swimming pool, spa service and not to mention their food in the long table and room service. absolutely flawless place.\n", "\nSo, being a student that has just graduated, my stay at Awarta was extremely needed to unwind with all of the final projects and finals completed! They picked me up from the airport in an extremely nice car and it was there that I met Eva, who would be my butler for the duration of my stay. She carries herself in a way that communicates all that Awarta stands for. Calm, relaxed, professional, and very prompt. Anything that was required, was met with haste and always taken care of with a smile. During my week, I had Mr. Yasin as my personal driver. For my day trips, Eva organised so many places to see in Ubud, Uluwatu, and evenings in Kuta. The food... oh the food!!! You will be able to experience the rich heritage of Chinese Indonesian in the traditional Chinese Restaurant, or a little bit of anything and everything in the Long Table. ", "If you are after a refreshing time of quite, you have everything you would need in your vila, and quick room service is only a call away. The fountain in the pool is so relaxing if you are wanting to spend time laying out or just sitting poolside.

Our favorite entree was woku chicken and thumbs up for their dessert chocolate meringue cake with orange sorbet, we highly recommend you to try both of them. ", "SPA was awesome, so relaxing!", "Staffs were friendly, quick responses, they helped us with flight check in and everything we need during our stay. One of the staff asked my husband if we wanted to go to the beach, they happened to manage a cooperation with a private beach in nusa dua just 5 mins away by car. We went there, it was serene. ", "If you love shopping there's a mall called Bali Collection just 5 mins away by foot.", "After all the villa was luxurious yet it worth every penny.

", "Thank you Awarta for making our honeymoon memorable!\n", "\nAwarta Nusa Dua Luxury Villas and Spa is nestled in BTDC complex, it's truly a hidden gem in Nusa Dua area where you will find numbers of convention-sized 5-star hotels within the area. Awarta consists of different types of villas, all private! with pool yeah! I tried the one-bedroom villa which its spaciousness is just suitable for me or I think for a couple will also be a perfect fit. The bed is super huge and comfortable. Moreover, there's a big pool in front of the bed-room and the rest of the facilities : living rooms areas, out-door seating, small garden is well spread out within the villa compound itself. I also like the giant bathtub standing sexily within the outdoor bathroom area. See the photo.", "Foods: I had lunch at the Long Table where there are mixed of international and local dishes. I tried Nasi Goreng which is always my favorite and whenever I am in Bali I will order this dish to make sure that foods will always taste nice when you go local ;) As you can see from the photo, the portion is big and the quality of the foods is very good. Oh coffee here is pretty nice as well. Ask for iced cappuccino.", "Spa: This is a must! to try if you stay here.", "When I arrived, the spa receptionist asked me what type of massage I preferred. I just told her that I had very tension back and shoulder cos I worked in front of computer most of the time. I just wanted something relaxed yet released the muscle tension. So the receptionist suggested me 'Nuad Pra Kob' a Thai Compressed massage. I was hesitated at the beginning cos it sounded like I'm gonna burn my back /shoulder but I did try. I got male therapist who is very professional and explained to me what was included in the compress bun (I called it like this) and how it would help me. It was hot at the beginning but after a while the body got used to the heat and the therapist also massaged me at the same time. It's indeed relaxing. After I finished the therapy, I felt my body was very light and the tension at my back disappeared. (Happy face) Talking about the price, it's very reasonable. I live in Singapore where the cost to have such a nice massage like this will be over US$200 for 1.5 hours but at Spa Cenvaree, for this program costs less than US$100. Compared with the reliable massage, service and clean facilities, it's worth trying.", "There are a couple of 2-3-bedroom villas that can accommodate 2-3 families which I think next time I should try if I travel here with friends/ family.\n", "\nPerfect at every step.", "Perfect location , perfect product, perfect food, perfect service.", "All employees were so genuinely nice. The only problem is that our trip was too short.", "Special mention for the spa treatments which were the best we had in the whole island.\n", "\nI almost visited all high end 5 star pool villas in different place of Bali but the Hospitality which the staff of these hotel served specially Miss.Eva n all was incomparable with beautiful and large pool villas...", "Rather they treated us very royally and d Scottish chef was awesome...\n", "\nDear Tripadvisor readers!", "We stayed at the 2 bedroom villa for 2 nights. We were a family of 5 so we had to have an extra-bed. A private pool and sperate living room was the highlight of our stay. ", " We were there to celebrate the 20th anniversary of my parents. ", "It all started with staff of Centara Grand receiving us from the aiport with chrysler (super cool car). Since this resort is quite new and still under construction everything was so classy and beautiful. When we entered this resort it was a dream come true. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The most important and royal feeling came when we went for a massage at the spa section. ", "The owners of Centara Grand Nusa Dua are very very nice people and made sure that we were comfortable througout our stay. We ate at both restaurants: chinese and long table. The Scotthish chef at long table is really a chef who cooks authentically. ", "We loved our stay there. We look forward to be there already this year!

Every dish that he cooked for us that night was declious. Starting with the soup (hot and sour and fish maw), beef tenderlion, prawns.... I do recommend eating at least once in Ruyi if you are staying there.\n", "\nI had a four day break on a recent business trip to Asia-Pacfic, and could not have picked a better spot to spend it than Centara Grand Villas Nusa Dua. Still in \"soft opening\", I was able to book a one-bedroom villa for an incredible deal (book now while you can still get this!). There are 64 suites being constructed on the property, but at no point did I hear any construction noise in my private villa or in the resort amenities. ", "From the moment I arrived at the Denpasar airport, every moment of the next 4 days was pure pleasure. I was greeted by hotel staff at the airport and whisked away in a brand new luxury van to the resort property, where check-in was quick and easy. Rendy, who met me at the airport and assisted with check-in, showed me to my villa and after a quick foot massage and scrub, showed me the around and explained the villa. Even the wifi was good!", "I took a short video tour of the villa, you can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inJG2q6eZZQ", "I took some time in the spa and found it was world-class and very well priced. I had a 90 minute massage, which was bumped up to 105 minutes thanks to a 15-minute massage gift-certificate I received at check-in. The facilities were excellent and the quality of my treatment was as well. ", "I ate at both the restaurants, Long Table and Ru Yi (Chinese) and both were excellent. The \"spa\" menu for lunch at Long Table was especially a treat with the Lobster and Watermelon dish that I came back for the next day as well. Service at both restaurants was impeccable. The resort manager and food & beverage manager came over to introduce themselves and check in on my stay multiple times. ", "Twice I went to the beach club affiliated with the resort. It's worth noting that the hotel does not have its own beach-front property, but is a member of an amazing beachfront club located a couple of km away. The staff was happy to arrange transportation to and from the beach and the staff of the club also offered the highest level of service. The food in the restaurant on-site was also amazing. Just bring your visa card, they don't take american express and you cannot bill to your resort folio at Centara. It should also be noted that this club can be reserved for private events (receptions, weddings, etc) and it is closed to Centara guests at those times, which are usually late afternoon or evening so minimal impact as your skin will already be tanned from the Bali sun. ", "I cannot say enough abut the quality of service and friendliness of the staff. Each of the staff knew my name and greeted me whenever I saw them. I was genuinely sad to say goodbye at the end of the trip. A big \"suksma\" to the entire team at CGND. ", "I would recommend this resort to anyone and would not hesitate to stay there again.\n", "\nA great place I would like to recommend to every one who goes travelling in Bali, the villa with one bedroom is very nice ,Quiet and leisurely environment which promises the residents ultimate privacy. The staff was so nice and cookies were delightful~ and the chinese restaurant very nice too. I would recommend it to my friend, and we would stay there again!\n", "\nI had an opportunity to visit their property. Territory is beautiful! Very relaxation. Had a feeling of being in Paradise. Beautiful villas, each with big swimming pool with. Perfect for a family or friends vacation. Had an amazing Spa experience. The ambience, atmosphere, service, staff all is on a high level. Massage was one of the best i had in Bali.They had sauna and steam rooms that make your visit more enjoyable. I will definitely be back! Thank you!\n", "\nTotally new place with only 14 private villas. They are building some appartments as well, but not yet open. As the hotel has just opened we were able to see the 2 and 3 bedroom villas as well. Truly fantastic, very elegant and stylish with lots of space. We also loved the SPA treatment and ambience. Very professional staff and great facilities. The only (very) minor downside was some construction noise, but in exchange they have great rates until the remaining work is done!\n", "\nHaving lived in bali for far too long, it's always a challenge to find new and exciting options for the kids. Through a friend we heard of the generously spaced villas at Centara and had to look for ourselves to be sure. Right enough the one bedroom villa we had could sleep a family of 6! The kids had a blast with the cascading pool water feature and the outdoor bathtub. We didn't get a chance to sample out the signature Chinese restaurant however we will definitely be back for more weekend family time. A must try are the desserts at the long table restaurant.. Looking forward to our next trip soon.\n", "\nWe are used to go to bali but last time we went there we just wanted to change a bit our usual place to stay and we went to Grand Centara... woow... what a incredible experience is was !!! the place is just awesome with wonderful rooms, quiet and with a lot of privacy, the facilities are absolutely great. Back from the beach, we gave ourselves a so relaxing time at the spa before to enjoy the chinese restaurant there. ", "The sherry on the cake is the staff, always careful, available and smiling to make your stay the most enjoyable moment.", "We were very warmly welcomed by Edouard who was always careful about every single detail that make the big difference..Definitely the best stay we ever had in bali and no doubt, we will come back and stay to Centara grand next time we will go to bali\n", "\nWe just spent a day in Centara, this new property in Nusa Dua complex has it all. It's nestled in the most luxurious spot in Bali,with the cleanest white sand beach few minutes away (walking distance or drop off by car) all villas are ground level,with the beautiful gardens you'll feel that u are in paradise. We love our one bedroom villas is spacious,with good size private pool and deck. Linens and toiletries are top quality make sure you get the most comfortable stay. There is a Chinese and an International restaurant that open 24hrs in the property and also a bar that serve any cocktails you wish for. Staff from the gate guards,front desk,housekeeping they all have their smiles on their face so nice to see. We did try their Spa, its to die for. Its not cheap but its worth all the money you paid if not more. We can't wait to come back! Thank you Centara!!\n", "\nCentara Nusa Dua definitely swept me off my feet. From the time I arrived all the way to the end of my trip. The driver and guide had smiles flashing on their faces when they first met me. I had a massive pool villa to myself and had the friendliest and most accommodating staff around. Location is perfect if peace and quiet is your ultimate desire. You can still easily still go to different parts of Bali even if you are in this gated area. Massage was absolutely divine. I wish I had an hour more to spare but schedule was tight. Centara is highly recommended - families, couples, individuals, what have you. A must check out.\n", "\nWe recently had a wonderful stay at Centara Grand Nusa Dua & Villa. Everything is done to forget your daily stress and to enjoy a discreet and relaxing place where the staff has a high level of hospitality from the top manager Edouard to all the staff around you. Great food and choices especially the chineese diner experience.Thank again for your warm welcome and quality of service, we felt like at home at Centara.\n", "\nWow... nice brand new hotel... it was an excellent choice... me and my partner had a wonderful weekend... the villa is very well structured with beautiful surrounding... and the services were excellent... We will definitely be back again...\n", "\nMe and my partner had the best 3 days here! What a luxury! They really know what customer service is. Nice little touches like remembering your name and your favourite drinks. Lovely staff overall! And don't let me start on the SPA. I can safely say I am a bit of a massage junkie and love to go anytime, and they did not disappoint me. I had two 90 minute treatments and everything is thought of. You even have to fill in a card beforehand where you would like them to pay attention to and what areas to ignore. It's the small touches that makes for a great 5 star resort. The Villa was incredibly clean! The pillows were to die for.. not to mention the romantic bathtub.. The food was really good as well as the service in both restaurants. We had Chinese food one night and after living in China for two years, I can easily say this was as authentic as it could be! I really recommend this place.. A lot of hotels call themselves 5 stars, but they are really not.. Centara in Nusa Dusa can easily be a 5++. I will come back!\n", "\nWe went to Centara Grand Nusa Dua for a weekend with a couple of friends and it was WOW. The villa was an attraction in itself. My favourite parts were the really cool pool, the outside bathtub and shower and the super comfy bed. If it wasn't was for the other cool facilities worth trying, we wouldnt have left it for the whole stay :D Buuuut when I went to the Spa Cenvaree, I felt like I travelled to a different planet. The Balinese massage, quiet atmosphere and friendly staff just gave me an incredible dose of relaxation - just MUST do it when u'r there. Another must I would recommend is all the pastas at the Long Table restaurant (and the cool concept of the long, wooden table itself - especially useful for a dinner with friends). Oh and the fresh, real, delicious bread - sth really rarely experienced in Bali. To sum up, if you look for a quiet, private and relaxing stay - totally go for it!\n", "\nI had a very nice moment here ! Will tell some friends to go there for sure ! The restaurant was very good and the service also ! We really enjoy the room, lot of space and nice decoration. Thanks a lot\n", "\nOne of the best experience ever had! The service staff are extremely amicable and very attentive to guest's needs. Beautiful scenery and facilities. Definitely one of the must go retreat that a family or couple should have to spend some quality time together, and enjoying the tranquility there within.\n", "\nThe rooms are not protected from the noise of other guests. Our first morning, after getting in around 3am, we were woken from the wake-up call and calls from the room beside; this happened again the next working. Most other nights we were woken from other guests walking to their room and talking. It's not that they were being noisy, but rather the tiled and enclosed area means sound has no where to travel and there are no signs reminding guests that other guests could be sleeping. The rooms don't have any cupboards to put folded clothes. There are about 6 coathangers in a the hanging area and where bags can be stored underneath but only if dresses/clothes/etc are short. The balconies was very small and half the space was taken up with a rectangle stool type chair. The restaurant and room service predominantly cater for Asians. There was no children's menu and even when trying to order something for a child was met with roadblocks - I asked what the steamed vegetables were that came with the chicken to find out it was cucumber and the likes (yes steamed salad). The children's pool isn't really entertaining for a child above 3 -4 years. And the beach is covered with litter in the water and on the sand. There are push bikes that you can hire/borrow from the hotel but once again nothing for children. There is no tour desks and it would appear that staff know someone and thus it's not always the best option. All in all, this is not a place that caters for children\n", "\nWe had a lovely stay at this hotel for a week in June. Only a 10 minute walk or 5 minute shuttle bus to the beach. Close to good restaurants. Beautiful swimming pool. Our only complaint would probably be that the beds are very small compared to all the other Bali hotels we have stayed at and the fridge was just a bar chill type which meant you never had nice cold drinks in your room. The staff were very friendly and very helpful nothing was too much trouble for them and the rooms were cleaned to a very high standard. Highly recommend .\n", "\nIt is located in nice area of Nusa Dua. The room is very small, but clean. The facilities are standard, but when we stayed there the pool was under renovation. You can rent bike to have a nice afternoon sightseeing in Nusa Dua Area. Overall just an OK hotel.", "\n", "\nNeeded a place to crash with 4 kids and 4 adults as we arrived late (early morning) into Bali. Picked the Mercure and was a good bet.

I stayed in a Superior Room which was extremely compact and I think would be quite cramped for two people. It was much smaller than any other accommodation in which I've stayed in Bali. The hotel facilities are good, with good service, a large pool on two levels, a spa with good (but expensive) massage and treatments, and breakfast had a wide range of offers. I didn't eat any other meals here apart from a snack one day, which was again very expensive. ", "There is nothing of particular interest in the immediate local area and it is about a 20 minute walk to the beach. It's even a reasonable walk just to leave the hotel! I wouldn't choose to stay here (it was selected for me by the conference) and in fact I wouldn't choose to stay in Nusa Dua again as there appears to be very little to do compared to the many other interesting places in Bali.\n", "\nThe bed are small, my room 320 have a leaked ceiling that makes my room feels very humid.

Not having been to Nusa Dua before, me and my partner were slightly concerned that it would be far from the beach. Although it is not as close as some of the other hotels it's definitely not far either. It's probably about 1.5 kms and there are lots of restaurants and shops nearby. I liked not being super close, (gave me a chance to work some of all that nasi goreng off). ", "The rooms are great size and style. Modern and clean and if you buy the breakfast that's good value.

The beach is quite a walk away but taxi is cheap in this part of the world. The lobby area is pretty impressive and it certainly didn't feel like a $35 a night hotel.

Got free buffet breakfast as part of the rate and was impressed by the variety on display.", "The only thing disappointing about the hotel was the room. We got \"upgraded\" to a Deluxe room which meant a room closer to the restaurant and the pool. But that also meant that traffic around the room was higher and noisier than the regular rooms. The walls between the rooms were also paper thin. We could hear crystal clear everything that was said next door and even what they were watching on TV. I didn't realize that walls could be this porous. Towing a 2 year old with us, we were just relieved that the couple next door didn't do any hanky panky stuff the night we were there.

I even need to seek assistance from the management to solve the problems. Although the duty manager Ms Fanny tried her best to change a room for us but we still faced the same problem after the room changed. Besides the food served in the restaurant was terribly slow. It was not busy but It still took more than half an hour to serve us the dishes and worst still the wrong dish.

Our opinion is probably a little tainted as we had been looking forward to the resort style of Novotel with a kids club for our children and some other forms of activity. The hotel was really clean and neat and the pool was beautiful, however the view of the hotel wall from the pool was not quite the outlook we had hoped for and there was no other entertainment for the children. The rooms were ridiculously small. We had three children in one room and you couldn't get from one side to the other without climbing over the beds. There is also not a separate bathroom so anytime we wanted to get changed, we had to close up our room so that passers by couldn't see in. I also suspect that this hotel is advertised mostly to the Asian market as there were very few English speaking people there and those we met seemed to be only staying for a night or two. On the positive side, we received a room upgrade to a lovely poolside room and the swimming pool itself was lovely. The staff were really friendly and made an effort to get to know us however English was a big barrier for some. Special thanks to Kiky and Kariasa who really helped to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.

Reception staff were so accommodating to our needs and couldn't do enough for us. Included in our staff was breakfast and it was fresh and their was variety. Bacon and eggs was available plus a variety of cereals, breads, juices and Indonesian food. We also purchased an evening meal from the restaurant and it was great value for money. Markets, restaurants and spas are just around the corner while the beach and shopping centre are a short stroll or you can take the complimentary shuttle service.

Free shuttle operates to the nearby Nusa Dua beach. We opted to go Geger beach (quieter beach comparatively) little further away and the driver of the shuttle obliged and dropped us there.

Great for a girls getaway!!\n", "\nTrue, this is not the Mandarin Oriental or even the Hilton, but for what you pay, the Mercure Nusa Dua is very good. I paid for the Bali Lombok promotion which included free airport transfers -- making this a very viable overnight hotel, just 25 minutes from the airport. Upon check-in, I was given a room on the ground floor (Floor 1) which had a \"patio\" door that led to a parking lot. As a woman travelling solo, I refused it for security reasons and the front desk was incredibly responsive. Without argument, they found me a room on an upper floor with a small balcony. Here's my advice: Never accept a room on the ground floor of this hotel. Like other properties in southern Bali, this hotel has a serious problem with damp. You can smell the mold in a ground floor room. But take a room on the 2nd Floor or above, and the problem disappears! Other positives: the pool, you'll love it. The downside to this hotel: the restaurant. The food is fine but the place is an oven, no aircon and it's a trap for heat, you'll leave as cooked as your food. In summary: stay here, but order room service.\n", "\nThe staff at the Mercure Nusa Dua were amazing and made our stay comfortable and really special. Due to a severe ear infection my boyfriend was not able to fly so we had to extend our stay at the Mercure.

The manager even personally greeted us while we were checking out and asked us if we would like to have a late check to relax and shower before our flight.

Overall, quite good location.", "2) Check in and Hotel Grounds: Hotel ground is huge with plants and grass. Look nice tho' just like the other bigger resorts in Nusa Dua/Benoa. Security check is very strict and good. Felt very safe in the hotel compound. Check in was fast.", "3) Superior Room Pool Facing: Yes, the room is a little compact but i think the space is just nice for 2 persons. Room is simple and modern and clean. The mattress and pillows are ok. Not fantastic but at least it is comfortable. I love the rainshower concept in the bathroom. It was good. My room (219) balcony is facing the pool. Gorgeous view.", "4) Free Snack under Accors Festive Promo Package: Hmm, only 2 free spring rolls. I think hotel should include at least free coffee/tea with the 2 free spring rolls. Definitely look nicer. If Mercure Kuta Bali free snack has so many things and with a drink, I am not sure why the same Mercure Nusa Dua cannot do so.", "5) Buffet Breakfast: For a 4 star hotel, the breakfast overall was good. Food presentation is good and clean. For improvement, please consider offering at least one type of fresh fruit juice besides the usual orange/mango juice (which is not fresh from bottle).

I love the deco around the pool.", "7) Wifi: Good signals around hotel area and in my room.", "8) Mercure Beach Club: I think the hotel should invest more in the future and build a proper bar at the beach club. Having drinks inside a huge plastic container is not a good idea in my opinion. Does not look clean. Having said that, the beach chair, beach area is great. Sea water is very clean and suitable for swimming.", "Overall, this new Mercure Nusa Dua has a lot of potential, could also even be upgraded to Grand Mercure if being maintained or upgraded properly.

The pool and the garden were nice and well kept. The food at the restaurant was actually good with a reasonable price. The shuttle to the beach could run more frequently (like once every 30 minutes instead of one hour). The beach club was very nice but we could only swim around noon because of the tide.\n", "\nWe stayed 6 nights from 30th January it was our second stay. No refreshment was offered on check in and no mention of us staying previously. We booked a suite this time as the rooms are quite small but apart from very limited cupboard space and the wooden floor in the sitting room badly bucked, it was ok. Still small but more comfortable with the extra room. My first night walking back to the hotel,(it is quite dark needs more lighting from road to hotel), I fell quite badly spraining/twisting my ankle. My husband went to reception for someone to help but no-one seemed to understand nor really care. After sometime a man did drive down and gave me a lift back to reception. He couldn't find a wheelchair so he helped my husband carry me to our room. Next morning after breakfast with a badly swollen and bruised ankle,there was a problem with the bill, I was asked to sign or pay for breakfast even though I had booked bed and breakfast on line which was confirmed at check in. I was asked to go up to Reception where the matter was finally resolved. I asked to see the Manager but my request was unsuccessful. There was a dangerous situation with the kettle in our room, when it boiled it spewed boiling water high into the air and was impossible to switch off. The fridge,floor and bench were covered in boiling water. I insisted that the fridge and kettle be replaced and they were. Again I asked to talk to the Manager, again no one came. The last 2 nights it rained heavily during the night and we were kept awake with a loud dripping noise when we complained about it we were told that when we checked out they would look at it. Thankfully we travel with ear plugs which helped to muffle the noise slightly. I rang 'O' and asked for room service and ordered some noodles (they were delicious) and was told to wait 15 mins. after 45 mins. I rang to ask where my noodles were to be told there was no order placed!!! Again a communication breakdown. A tendency to clear plates before you have finished eating is extremely frustrating and perhaps the staff would better be instructed to enquire after the guests health.

The room was a bit small and Ibis like, as it had a sink in the room, and the shower and toilet were separate. This hotel is more run down than a hotel its age should be, with rust and dead bugs seemingly implanted on the tiles in the corridors and on the stairs. On two occasions I found a cockroach and a bug in the shower, along with numerous other insects and bugs on the block out curtains and around the door. The door leading to the balcony was semi-broken, allowing water to come into our room every time it rained. On one occasion the toilet flush broke, however this was fixed shortly after. There is absolutely no sound proofing in the room, and on the first morning the hotel staff were doing wake up calls by loudly banging on all the rooms and saying good morning as loudly as possible. When we went outside to ask them to be quiet they found it surprising we were asleep, even though it was only 8am on a Saturday! The service was good, however they spoke very little english so communication was often hard. Breakfast was nothing special. I ordered the club sandwich minus bacon for lunch one day, and the waiter brought it to me and said there was no bacon, however there was bacon, but no chicken! Housekeeping was very inconsistent, as on certain days our pillows and overthrow would be left on the floor, and on other days they would be left on the beds...

From the congee to noodle soup, bacon and sausages, a modest but complete salad bar, local fare as well on offer, fruit and cheese, an assortment of breads and an egg station. The rooms indeed are small but certainly well worth the price paid No problems with plumbing, airconditioning and cleanliness, as well as a friendly and attentive staff, inobstrusive but NOT inattentive.

Our verandah was very small and had to be careful not fall off the steps down. Maybe these could be levelled out a bit. The hotel had a courtesy bus to their beach - but for us it was in walking distance if we so wished - took about 20 minutes. The local shopping centre - Bali Collection also had a courtesy bus.

It has its private beach 5 minutes drive from the hotel. Hotel provides shuttle service to and from the beach. The beach is ok not fantastic.", "Room is small. Almost no place for the second suitcase. It is ok though. The service is wonderful. The people at the reception were very helpful and always smiling. My only problem is the sound proofing of the room. I heard doors banging at night and in the morning. The tv from other rooms can be heard in our room.", "Breakfast is very basic and almost the same everyday.\n", "\nStayed here with friends Julie and Ross. Brand new hotel has lots teething problems, hotel room staff excellent, rooms very small, food below standard,coffee terrible, few facilities, I stayed here for two weeks, I managed in small room but poor Julie and Ross rooms far too small.hard for me to come back or recommend this hotel unless changes are made . I would suggest.quick fixes Putting some drawer storage in rooms either side of bed.reassess the desk area could have storage drawers there , also needs a mirror on wall over desk so we girls can do hair & makeup,as no bathroom just toilet room and shower room hard to get in and out of both if two in room. great pool but no shade area needs sail ,fact no shade anywhere on complex that needs attention, not good for children .no spa no coffee shop staff need barista training and decent coffee machine, food well don't go there never been in any Accor chain hotel with a menu like this one .new chef just started hope he can turn things around. Really the buk stops with management suggest manager takes a good look at all these comments. Could be really beautiful if managed correctly and a few things are done to make guest stay more comfortable wonder where manager eats? Bali is tourist mecca so pork bacon ,skim milk and soy milk aren't that hard to supply surely,management should look a little down road at Novotel I have stayed there before and that's where we go for coffee & brekky great themed dinners entertainment great for kids families facilities excellent rooms spacious that's where we will be staying again when next in Bali early next year. Best thing I can say about Mercure Nusa Dua is we got our daily exercise walking to and from Novotel for coffee, breakfast ,Pause cafe is a life saver. Would come back to Mercure only if invited and improvements made but not as a paying guest sorry Accor love your hotel chain but this beautiful hotel on outside needs more love and thought on inside .staff did point out managers quarters though no problems with size there by the looks.come on Mercure get it together!!!!\n", "\nThis hotel is probably not where you want to spend your Bali holiday, but at the right price, it's a good place to get a night's sleep, a hot shower and one last swim before catching your flight. Make that 2 swims, the beach (accessed by shuttle) is good, the pool is impressive.", "Skip the breakfast buffet and walk across the road to Pause Cafe at the back of the Novotel for breakfast though.\n", "\nPlease don't use this hotel if staying for more than 2 days. Room extremely small. No drawers no shelves. Can not unpack. No power points for hair dryer. Room extremely small. Breakfast buffet. Really bad. No bacon or eggs allowed. No coffee. Reception staff. Do not do anything you ask. No spa no shop Not much here. Obvious. Bad management. Okay if on business for a couple of days. Nothing for children here. Nothing for adults\n", "\nThis new hotel has wide area of parking and reception. It has a small gym with good quality equipments. I stayed with my family during Nyepi Day. We had a great time and spent the day swimming and exercising. Overall, it is clean and has good service. I will recommend my friends to stay at this hotel.\n", "\nIts brand spanking new and that is pretty much what its got going for it NOW. I have never stayed in a hotel room with the sink in the main bedroom. It is awkward to get in and out of cubicles ( separate toilet and shower) with glass doors that open into each other and too close to the sink. The bedroom was small. With luggage, we could hardly move around. The little fridge hardly cooled the drinks. The terrace that overlooks the pool area is the size of a flower box. They had a small bench on it. One can't sit there and catch rays. The balcony is cement so no way to sit on the balcony and enjoy any view. We definitely couldn't sit two people on the terrace. The AC at least works but wish they had written instructions on how to set it. We thought we'd set the temps before we left and came back to a very hot room. It would have saved misery if they had instructions.", "Breakfast is mediocre. Price is too much considering what there was. We happened to be staying here on a night when there was a major downpour and we'd gone out that night. The street the hotel is located OUTSIDE the BTDC was flooded in seconds. We had no choice but to wade thru floodwaters above the ankle. Motorcycles were driving on the pavement. Worst still is that there are open drains ( they have been like that for years) and those drains were covered in water and unmarked. Someone could just fall into one of those. We were scared but had no choice but brave it as it was late at night. Not exactly a dream experience. The room wifi connections sucked too. Housekeeping was inconsistent. The only thing the hotel has going for it is that it is new.\n", "\nNice and clean hotel. it still new. They offer free shuttle to Bali Collection (shopping area at BTDC), wish they have free shuttle to kuta area, the traffic jam is worst. ", "I stayed there on mid March with my wife, small room but, think is quite alright for both of us since we seldom spend time in the room. Most of the day we went out and enjoy Bali. They have free wi-fi.\n", "\nThis time, I would like to share my experience staying in a newly opened Mercure Bali Nusa Dua. Both of me and my wife were visiting Bali the 2nd time for Christmas holiday last year as we got a good (hotel) offer we could not refuse. ", "It all started when we arrived in Bali in the morning of December 24, 2012, after driving for about eleven (11) hours from Surabaya, my hometown. We decided to go to the hotel directly this time after spending many hours on the road. It was not so difficult for us to find the hotel although it took us more than 10 minutes to figure out how to get there when we arrived in Nusa Dua area. ", "The best way to find this hotel is finding the access road going to St. Regis Bali, Mulia Resort or Nikko Bali Resort and Spa as it is basically the same exact road heading to all these hotels. This hotel is much closer to Nusa Dua By Pass compare to other hotels I've mentioned before. So, if you can't find the signboard to Mercure Bali Nusa Dua, try to find signboard heading to any of the above hotels and for frequent travelers to Bali, I guess they would have no problem in finding the hotel if they know how to get to NIkko Bali Resort and Spa. ", "We're quite impressed when we arrived in the security check-point : From distance, someone could see similar designs when we entered W Retreat & Spa Bali - Seminyak or even in Mulia Resort. The entrance gate appeared to be quite grand but when we drove further, we would see empty parcel in our surroundings and from there, we could see the main building and its parking structure.", "We both arrived in the hotel around I:30 ~ 2:00 pm (Bali/local time) and we proceeded straight away to the front desk for check-in. The check-in procedure itself took quite longer than usual as we had to wait in the lobby for approx. 15 minutes before our room was ready. There was another guests arrived almost at the same time as ours and I saw they also had to wait in the lobby. Well, we could live with that and after driving for 11 hours, 15~20 minutes really was not a big deal for us.", "When we entered our room, I immediately felt disappointed to learn how small our room was considering this was a four-stars-hotel. The room was approx. 20~25% smaller than the room in Mercure Bali Harvestland Kuta. For seconds, I had a strong impression whoever designed the room, they were trying to build as many rooms as possible in one floor. However, the good thing was everything seemed to be in order at the time we checked-in : Air conditioner worked nicely, everything was nice and clean and the best thing was we even have a (small) private balcony although we could not see any view from there but at least we could get fresh air anytime we wanted it.", "We had a good sleep in the first night and we did not realize the first problem until we woke up the next morning. We woke up early the next day after hearing people (and children) walking, running, talking, playing and even countless of loud bang of opened and closed doors. Well, frankly speaking, this was something I did not expect to find during my stay especially in any of Nusa Dua Hotels and it's happening every morning !!! Until now, I could not imagine how any of the hotel guests could stand this horrible situation when they were visiting Bali for holiday and would like to have a good night's sleep.", "In my honest opinion, the hotel was poorly designed (certainly for its sound proof) and poorly built. It was sad for me to say but that's my honest opinion after staying in this hotel property for six (6) days. During my stay, you would see water dripping from the ceiling in the shower area but there was one thing I certainly would not accept was the fact that the house keeping did not even replace/clean the cups in the room for the duration of our stay !!!", "This horrible situation worsened with the act of few front desk staffs when I requested a late check-out (1:00 pm) and after few requests, both of us felt we were being ignored by them so that we decided to proceed with check-out immediately. In the front desk area, I managed to speak with Head of Finance Controller (if I was not mistaken) where I shared my experience. ", "He was quite responsive by taking down my feedback and even offered me to speak directly with Mr. Peter Stolk who happened was standing in the lobby area, talking with one of the hotel owners who stayed in the hotel property with his family. Since I lost my mood already, I politely refused his offer but I decided to fill out a comment card which Mr. Peter replied after receiving it.", "In my personal opinion, it is a pity that this hotel is not properly built and run as it supposedly. The hotel certainly is located in one of the prestigious area in Bali (Nusa Dua) where many world renowned hotels are being built in this area. Although we were quite impressed by the second we arrived in security check-point but basically there was nothing in the hotel except a good size swimming pool for the hotel guests to enjoy.", "Finally, based on our experience in staying at this hotel, both of me and my wife have decided that this would be our last stay in this hotel : Yes, we decided to stay away from this hotel as nothing was properly performed and managed. However, as a newly built hotel, I hope they are willing to listen to guests' feedback and realize that many other hotels are doing whatever they can to keep their guests coming back. Hotel's competition in Bali is so fierce these days so that anyone who operates hotel in Bali simply can't close their eyes as they can lose the business these days if they don't perform and treat the clients well enough.\n", "\nIt is a great place to stay, I would definitely be staying here again....I arrived at the airport at around midnight, so I had organized for hotel pickup, and the Indra who picked me up from airport was great, gave me lots of information about Bali, as this was my first time to Bali. All the do's and don'ts. The pictures that are put up by management do not do the justice with hotel. The hotel has a vast garden, great layout. I never thought that this hotel would be so awesome. Check-in was smooth. Escorted to the room and everything was explained about the hotel. During my four nights stay, I was completely awed by the staff, all of them, food was nice, although didnt ate much but whatever I had was tasty...stay in all was great....would definitely be coming back to this hotel, when I will visit bali, as hotels in Kuta and Seminyak are crowded by bars playing loud music and too much pollution. If someone has to stay in pollution then why even leave the city...Thank you Mercure Bali Nusa Dua for making my stay enjoyable....\n", "\nThis is a new 4* hotel, situated in Nusa Dua, but not in the enclave BTDC area though.", "I stayed here just last week. Got deluxe pool view room. I checked in already almost midnight thus I could not appreciate the surrounding including the garden etc. Even the taxi driver who drove me found that road from entrance to the lobby a little confusing, and it was so dim with very limited lights.", "The check-in was smooth, the front office staffs were all very good and helpful, kudos to them! I asked the to re-pack my stuffs and left in at the front office so I did not bother to bring it to my room.", "When I entered the room and try to insert my card into the power-house, it was already broken, not severely though but it was falling off.", "I like the room design, modern and fresh contemporary. Breakfast was standard nothing too special, I guess because so far their existing clients are locals and Asian (esp. China tour groups), there were just very few Caucasian during my stay there but I am sure if they expand their market they could also improve the buffet breakfast.", "I really hope they can keep up their services and the maintenance then they should be alright.\n", "\nwe stayed in this hotel during Nyepi Holiday and was signed for the nyepi package. receptionist was welcomed but the check inn proceed took so long. hotel room was poor super duper small not balance with the largest garden and hotel area even i did upgraded to deluxe room. the wood material of the door that they use is so poor and cheap because it was cracked and loose from the frame when i close the back door that facing to the pool. horrible..", "the F and B department should pay attention since the buffet always ran out of the food isn't it weird for the Mercure chain hotel reputation. based on my experienced we have to wait for the top up food for 15 minutes at least. breakfast ran out of fresh milk, the waiter said we don't have stock anymore...i don't even know how to said back. looks that the hotel management needs to learn a lot which is funny since they caring Mercure brand and the hotel is in popular resort area.\n", "\nMercure Bali Nusa Dua is still new, they opened around september 2012. The hotel was clean, modern tropical interior minimalist style, the rooms are also clean. The services of the staff were friendly. My ratings for this hotel are:", "I like: Clean, friendly service, modern style lobby, restaurant dishes were delicious, free and fast internet connection. Prices are relatively cheap for a 4 star hotel in the nusadua area.", "Dislike: Less variations breakfast. No spa and sauna. There is only one restaurant. Away from the beach but luckily the hotel provides a free shuttle to their private beach on the Nusadua. Room is small, so not suitable for family with little children, you should choose a larger room if you bring children, or rented two rooms with a connecting door. Because mercure is a business hotel so the activities and kids club for children not available. Lucky, they have a fairly good swimming pool for the children. But better you choose Novotel Nusa Dua or Novotel Benoa, they are more suitable for families with children.\n", "\nUpon first entry to the Mecure I was a little confused with the positioning. It was unlike where I usually stay in that it is on a very large property and set back from the street. Which is not neccesarliy a bad thing. Security check every car and manually open the gates after they have checked the boot and under the car. The reception staff are lovely and most have very good english. There was some confusion with my booking and I dont feel that when we paid with our le accor vouchers it was handled properly, somewhere along the line we lost money in conversion and the conversion rate was changed around 3 times during our conversation. Plus the rate was some made up hotel conversion rate and different to the acutal conversion rate. Would of been nice to know in advance and was very hard to understand at the time. Worked out us paying about $30 more than we thought we should have. The room was very modern and clean and while small it is very well laid out. We travelled with our 16 month old daughter and fit a porta cot in and still had room to move. One particular day housekeeping forgot to do our room and our mini bar was never restocked over our 5 night stay. I did request for it to be restocked at reception but even after this it wasnt stocked. The restaurant and staff that work there are AMAZING. They absolutely made the stay for us. Most nights we were the only ones in there and we were waited on with some of the best customer service we have had in a long time. Even with language barriers the service puts australia service (or lack thereof) to shame. The pool was a little cloudy and probably not suitable for children much younger than ours (or if you have a runaway child). Our daughter was treated so well by all the staff and had a great time. Most of the time we had about 5 people watching her with us (staff) so no need to worry about her. We are Accor members so found the meals and drinks cheap. Every night the staff were only too happy to help me brush up on my Bahasa. We would stay again for sure. WELL DONE\n", "\nThe staff at the this hotel are superb.

Twice tried the sit down/non-buffet restaurant for dinner and was a bit disappointed at the Indonesian dishes (not too authentic for our Indonesian taste bud)\n", "\nMy family and I were in Bali for 5 nights, we stayed in Four seasons for 3 nights and mulia villa for 2 nights. We had 3 villas during our stay at the mulia. Our butler, I think his name is Putra... was amazing. We woke up and he was waiting outside with a buggy to take us to breakfast, he had make sure that we have everything we need before he leaves. We went for a spa treatment and when we were back to our villa, he filled the jacuzzi with warm water and bubbles. He had provided us excellent service and if we do go back to Bali, we will for sure return to mulia.\n", "\nMy travel agent recommended me The Mulia and I will recommebd The Mulia everyone. because room was fantastic, pool was excellent, and restaurants always make good dishes!", "all the butlers were very kind and professional. thank you!\n", "\nThe Mulia Villa is not one of those traditional Bali-style resort, but all the villas were designed with welcoming interiors and private pools.

The buffet Japanese at Edogin is a must try!", "The Mulia Kidz Club was lots of fun for the girls.", "Room Service was also fantastic.\n", "\nIt was my 1st trip to Bali, and it's our honeymoon", "everyone recommended me The Mulia.", "room was excellent, pool was fantastic, restaurants were outstanding !", "all the butlers were very kind and professional", "it really was a fantastic honeymoon!!", "thank you Mulia ~!!\n", "\nMy partner and I were married in Nusa Dua 2 weeks ago and we chose to stay in Nusa Dua for honeymoon at The Mulia...and what an incredible time we had! It truly felt like a \"once in a life time\" moment. ", "The Mulia is extravagant and lush and divine and all of those things. ", "We stayed in a one bedroom Villa. It had a jaccuzi, lounge area, huge King bed, brand new Smart TV, huge walk in robe and vanity desk, two showers and the signature Mulia toilet (the lid opens automatically and it has all kinds of other automatic functions that you didn't realize you couldn't live without until you'd tried them...). It also had it's own pool, outdoor lounge area and butlers kitchen. We had a morning butler and an evening butler (Novin, our morning butler, was an absolute super star. She made our stay incredible) and they are ready at your service with a golf buggy anytime you need anything.

", "Stay at The Mulia. The resort section is just as magical as the Villas.", "The Mulia is not very \"Bali\" - it's more \"Heaven\"....\n", "\nThis is the 3rd time I've been in Bali and this experience can still amazed me by its facilities and services. I wouldn't say it's the best room I've been, actually they can do a lot more refine of layout and settings in the villa rooms. All staffs are extremely friendly and nice, especially the butlers of ours are very thoughtful! He noticed me having a bottle of whiskey on the first day, the second day when I get back to the room I have a bucket of ice and whiskey glasses ready next to my bottle, and I was really impressed. The villas is a bit away from all other restaurants and facilities in the resort, but you are just one call away to anywhere. The Mulia, Mulia Villas, and Mulia Resorts share the same beach which has a really nice and long coastline, but the sand is a little rough with some seaweed thingy swimming with you, but what can you ask for more? They have like 4, 5, 6 other pools all over the place? I mean, this is the only resort so far I would consider coming back, for real, gonna come back with family next time. ", "Oh! Lastly those foods... wide range of choices for buffet breakfast, as Villa guests you also get the visit other 2 restaurants for breakfast but those are a la carte menu, if you want to enjoy more quite and refine breakfast.\n", "\nVisited this resort in July 2014. It was excellent in everyway - 10 out of 10. The service was outstanding. Anything we needed was just a phone call away. The staff was very respectful and courteous. Resort is only 2 years old so very clean and posh!\n", "\nWe had not been to Bali in 14 years. Coming back and staying at the Mulia made the experience particularly wonderful. The hotel was beyond our expectations, starting from the welcoming drink and garlands around our necks to the discovery of our villa! The accommodation was of high standard and the amenities top grade. The villas were spacious; our children were comfortable in their large beds and our King size bed was just wonderful. The pool and garden provided us with peace and serenity and we had a number of lovely dinners in the garden under the moonlight. The bathrooms were spacious and we were able to enjoy a jacuzzi night that had been prepared by one of our butlers who knew we had been out all day!!", "The grounds were great and we could choose to either walk or be driven in the many golf buggies available to guests. The food was of high standard and the service exquisite. The staff tried to anticipate our needs and they seemed to genuinely wish us to enjoy their lovely island and hotel.", "Our butlers (three of them, Argus, Reva & Harayan) were attentive and looked after our every need. The communal swimming pools were well designed and we did not feel crowded or having to wait long for service. ", "The spa was well appointed and wonderfully furnished. The atmosphere was serene. The treatments were good and the time allocated was fully utilised, so that we did not feel rushed or as if we were in a factory so to speak. We believe that with time, the treatments will get even better. ", "If we could go back tomorrow, we would be on our way!!\n", "\nI stayed one night in this hotel. The place is just amazing. I had an excellent night. The bed was very good. The location and gardens are great. People are smiley and helpful. ", "It could have been the perfect stay if Internet was working.... ", "The food in the restaurant is on average.", "BUT I definitely recommend this hotel which environment, location and gardens are magic !!! I will be back again to mulia hotel\n", "\nWe stayed over the Christmas break at this fantastic hotel/resort in a room with pool views. It looked like the resort was brand new and absolutely spotless. It looks stunning. During our stay it was not very busy. ", "The hotel is contained with a compound in Nusa Dua. There are few small shops and roadside eateries within 10 minutes walking distance from the hotel, but for anything substantial a taxi ride to town is required. Having said that, we stayed for a week for relaxation purposes and were very content staying in the resort. ", "One thing to note is that the weather in December can be quite wet. The first few days there was quite a bit of rain, but after that we were lucky and had sunny warm weather every day. ", "The resort is located at the beach. The beach is itself is ok, but not fantastic. If you are after a white sandy tropical beach, this is not the place to be. Also, during the rainy season water quality can be quite poor. But then again, the hotel as a number of fantastic pools. The swim up bar was fantastic, so it is the day spa (though expensive). ", "Apparently there's a gym, but during our break we didn't really want to check that out. We're sure it'll be fantastic. :)", "Oh yeah and before we forget, the service was outstanding. We highly recommend this hotel. We're definitely going back.\n", "\nI decided to stay at the Mulia Vilas with my wife and our 2 babies just recently! We got a ocean view villa for 5 days! The villa was stunning! Beautifuly decorated, modern but with a Balinese feel throughout. Everything was top notch! Our butlers were incredibleeeede!!! Specially Pippi!!!! They even help us pack our luggage so that on the last day we could enjoy the pool a little bit more!!! ", "The breakfast every day was a gastronomic experience (like the Poached eggs on brioches with caviar!!!) the Spa was beautiful and the treatments were great as well!!! We did private Yoga with \"Merta\" and it was really special! The hotel also source baby sitter for us! Nitti and Arum took such great care of our 2 babies through our whole stay!!! I miss them dearly!!! The food also in Solei was fantastic! Try the catch of the day cooked Balinese style !! Yummyyyy! When we checked out and got into our cars we noticed like 10 staff people including our butlers, baby sitters, concierge manager Damien, and others thanking us and waving us goodbye!!! I literally cried ! I wanted to stay there longer and I can't wait to come back!!!!\n", "\nI stayed with my family for 4D3N in late June. It was the second time I stayed in Mulia. Last time I stayed in suite in The Mulia & it was the best hotel experience I've ever had around the world, so I decided to go again with my family, but this time to the most luxurious region within Mulia, Mulia Villas.", "Same as expected, the room is clean, classy, well designed & beautiful, especially we love the bathroom & the expensive automatic flushing toilet bowl. :)", "Service is good, but sometimes slow when we asked for a technician to check the lighting in our room. We waited for about an hour & called the service centre several times before the technician arrived. Maybe because the villa area is too large that the hotel staff took time to deliver what we wanted.", "We tried Table 8, the newly opened Chinese restaurant, for lunch, also Soliel & The Cafe for dinner. Food is excellent except that the service in Soliel is, again, too slow. We asked for several plates for sharing & hot tea, but even the dishes we ordered arrived, the waiters still hadn't given us the plates & tea. Their response time greatly improved after we did a little bit complaint. ", "Based on my experience as a repeated guest, the room staff (& staff responsible for The Lounge & The Living Room) has better English skills than the restaurant staff in the resort area. Some misunderstandings were made due to language barrier when we dined in Soliel.", "Thanks for Wawan & Agung who helped us taking beautiful pictures on the beach. They are very nice & helpful.", "Last area for improvement is the Wifi connection is very weak throughout the whole Mulia. My family & I had problem with sending out & uploading pictures. Luckily I brought my own pocket Wifi. I wrote this comment already the first time when I stayed in The Mulia suites. Apparantly the situation is not improved after half a year. I hope it will be better when I go again the next time.", "Though there are some areas for improvement, Mulia is overall undoubtedly the best new hotel resort in the southern Bali. Luxury, clean, well-designed are the reasons I will recommend to others & go again whenever I have chance! :)\n", "\nWhen we arrived at the Mulia Villas, my wife and I agreed that we had choosen the right place for our vacation. Our villas is well decorated with modern-style.My girl is still missing the private pool and the hugh jacuzzi. The room is spacious and clean.Butler Yana and fenny provided a superb service to us.All stuffs are well-trained and always have a welcome smile. ", "I am strongly recommended Mulia to anyone for family and couple visit. I long for my next visit to this wonderful villa.\n", "\n\"Wow\" is what I have to say about the facilities, the view from different parts of the hotel and the furniture and decors used in the restaurants and throughout the hotel. One of the swimming pools (yes, there are many swimming pools!) is facing its own private beach and lifeguards are closely monitoring guests' safety. As soon as I walked to my lounge chair, a staff person will come to me right the way and lay out the beach towel for me. All the staff members are very friendly and professional. The bathroom was huge and the toilet was high tech! There are plenty of couches throughout the hotel where you can hang out with your family/friends without feeling obligated to order drinks. There's a small bakery that I really liked. They even have 50% discount on the cakes (except for a couple of them), ice-cream and some bake goods after eight everyday. Their salad is pretty good too. The price is for the tray, not by pounds. So you can ask for whatever you want to assemble your salad. The only thing I was not very pleased with the hotel is the fact that it does not have queen size beds. I went with my husband and 7-year-old son. King sized bed doesn't work for us since my son kicks and turns in his sleep, so I asked for two beds. Agoda.com says it's either 1 king or two queens but the hotel has no queens. We ended up having two twins and they put them together for us. I ended up sleeping in the middle and I woke up with a back pain. For two days, I called the front desk and asked for a king and they said they didn't have any. Finally, I went back to them crying in the middle of the third night and boom! they switched me to another room that has a king sized bed. One more thing, they offer FREE babysitting service. Even my shy boy wanted to go in because the room was filled with different toys and even video games. They even gathered the kids and made flowers arrangement for the mothers. They offer a kids' menu inside the kids room so you can pay for them and they would arrive at lunch or dinner time. The babysitters are very nice and spoke good English. I was very impressed with that service.\n", "\nFantastic private villa stay at Mulia Villas. The combined property of hotel and villas is huge with 500+ hotel rooms and probably not my normal hotel profile of choice. Too big....but the villa stay provides exclusive service and privacy which exceeded our expectations. Plus the access to well equipped gym, wellness centre and a great Sunday brunch at Soleil when needed. The villa itself has great amenity....outside shower was fun, large whirlpool, sundeck and sala lounging options with good views day and night. The BBQ in our garden and sala was a great way to end the trip and recommended rather than eat \"out\".\n", "\nI stayed for three nights at Mulia Villas and my experience is really remarkable. I must appreciate the humbleness, service promptness and the incomparable etiquettes of the entire staff and crew. The butlers especially the Gafour and Harish were very nice. It is definitely one of the best property that I stayed in. World class ambience and location. SPA is very nice with trained therapists and wonderful amenities. It surely has the capabilities of being listed on top in the list of best luxury properties in the world. While you leave, all the staff saying bye to you, each passing by staff greets you\u2026 simply overwhelming. The other side of the experience is that it is a bit expansive and inflexible in their offers/plans. The food variety in Caf\u00e9 restaurant which is for normal resort rooms is much more than the limited variety available for the Lounge and Living room which are especially made for Villa guests. Very surprising!! They charge even for the calls that did not go through. Their exchange rate is higher than the normal rates. But overall one can surely visit Mulia Villas for an out of the world luxury vacation.\n", "\nThe experience of my three night stay at Mullia Villas in Nusa Dua was just astounding. I had to extend another three night with the special offer that they gave. I can vouch and say that Mulia Villas is easily the best hotel there is in Bali as advertised. They certainly deserve the social media exposure that they have been enjoying.", "I have never found a hotel crew that are more friendly and capable of serving only top quality services. I would definitely visit back Mulia Villas if i ever have another family/business trip to Bali. I would certainly encourage anyone to try their stay in Mulia Villas for a better and more enjoyable vacation / trip :).\n", "\nWe stayed here before moving on to The Laguna. As everyone reports, the Mulia Villas is new, sparkling clean and very modern. Alas, this left us feel cold and sterile--like we were staying in a high priced apartment complex. There was very little \"Balinese\" about it and little use of traditional wood. It could have been in Tokyo and, indeed, reminded me of some outstanding hotels in Tokyo and Singapore. Sadly, it isn't Bali. I wouldn't return for this reason.\n", "\nI've chosen Mulia based on TA review and extraordinary amount of its recent social media exposure.", "Been stayed at several Luxury resorts in Bali not once, not twice but many times, I was not putting my hope up high. However Mulia really impressed not myself also mum who visited Bali first time. ", "We stayed in a ocean view villa up higher and without too much noise which is just what Mum wanted. This is a great choice if you are taking your parents who does not want a jam packed itinerary or touring activities. The villa and resort area is huge you can either stay in your villa or explore a bit further towards the resort and beach area. ", "Our two butlers are extremely helpful and very attentive with just enough privacy. They have helped with getting the perfect day tour, arranging express airport services etc. Mum being a vegetarian and myself being gluten free has had a lot of choices of food and drink.", "If I really have to fault on one thing it would have to be the display and check out pricing. I booked the stay based on USD online, and was given an express check out summary in USD the day before check out. However, the actual final invoice was in Rupiah and then convert USD in card transaction...a bit of confusion and would have been better in a unified currency.\n", "\nI have stayed in many hotels around the world and the Mulia is a total experience in every way. We stayed in a pool villa and were treated like royalty and the butler service staff are the best. Staff and experience excellent\n", "\nLet me just start by saying that we decided upon this resort and more importantly the villas based purely on the positive reviews by the Tripadvisor community.", "From our initial third party booking to our checkout there was little at all to fault, really nothing at all. ", "We booked our transport direct with the resort and it was on time and with the exact model of vehicle we pre-selected to be transported by. This was very clean and very professional driver. I have personally been to Bali over 20 X and this was the best transport I have had to and from a hotel.", "Upon check-in (arrival 11.30am) we were informed that our villa was not yet ready (unfortunately) and we opted to grab some lunch from the Living Room. Very secluded and only available to villa guests. Service was great, yet expensive for even Bali (but we expected this across the calibre of accommodation). When staying in the Villa's you can choose to have your breakfast and afternoon tea here or at the Lounge which is located in the suite wing by the beach and is for sole use of only suite or villa guests. The Lounge was our favourite and the service levels of the staff here in my opinion were by far the best of what was already a pretty high level across the resort. I must make special mention of \"Surya\", the fantastic server and overall good guy that waited upon us on several occasions at The Lounge - ( I hope I have spelt his name right). I will go as far to say that he gave my wife and I the most professional and genuine service I have ever received, at ANY HOTEL, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. This is your superstar employee and all that dine at The Lounge should hope they get him. This takes nothing away from the generally fantastic service others talk about.", "I will point out though that whilst we visited the resort section of the hotel I noticed a very apparent difference in the level of this service, now although good in the resort it is far superior in all aspects at The Lounge and The Living Room. Others may differ but it was apparent to us and worth noting for those that look for the best of the best.", "Our vone bedroom villa we was given was by all accounts the best ocean view villa they have and it was comparable to any excellent resort suite we have stayed in Bali. The stand out was the spa, with the bigger than normal pool, the fantastic automated toilet (yes, I mentioned the toilet) and the excellent butler service we received from both Lukky and Ardi. The English spoken by the both of them was excellent and made for easy communication.", "The one thing and it is minor is that we felt the restaurants were not as good as the rest of the resort. What I mean is that for this resort they should have restaurants that better communicate dress standards and not allow children to play video games at loud volumes in their signature restaurants (this happened at both Edogin and Solei). It was obvious couples and small groups were also not amused. These restaurants are expensive and I know it is a resort but having people unaware and wearing suits etc on one table trying to enjoy the ambience of such a wonderful resort and then have people whom I agree are there to relax dining in shorts, thongs and t-shirts is proof that communication of dress code does not translate well.", "The only other negative was that our last night was Table 8 opening night (this is the Chinese restaurant) and we were expecting a fitting finale to our stay with a nice meal, but it felt like we were in Sizzler. On opening night you expect a few issues but when we went to order after looking at the comprehensive menu for nearly 15 mins we did not expect our server to come back and say that the pork belly would not be available on that particular set (even though it was listed as a signature dish). We opted to leave at that time and try Solei for a more relaxing ambience but unfortunately although better was not perfect. The food, the service was good, albeit pricey as I mentioned earlier.", "Also, ringing room service we encountered a few communication issues when I wanted to order a drink off the menu. I wanted a Pina Colada presented in a coconut but after numerous calls and time waiting simply gave up and requested just a Pina Colada in a glass as this was easier. Maybe this was just a communication error but maybe after three attempts they could have gone to a supervisor or manager with better English - anyhow minor and didn't affect our wonderful stay, but is a valid point to make if you are attempting to order anything off the menu.", "The grounds are wonderful and can 100% declare that this property is wonderful and has all the ingedients to make this the number #1 place to stay whilst in Bali. Far better than the St.Regis, W, Bulgari, Four Seasons, Chedi, Ayana etc - if considering these - stay here and you will not be disappointed with your decision.", "I almost forgot:) The Spa - it is very nice, good treatment rooms etc but is very expensive, probably the most expensive we have seen in Bali, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong actually anywhere.\n", "\nWe stayed at the pool villa and were greeted and treated like the whole resort was ours and made for us only. We have been to Italy, Spain, Dubai, Greece and many other countries and always stayed at the best hotels. A service and a resort like this we have never seen. They call it the Mulia experience. Thank you Hadi, Putra, Trishna and all of the staff of the other properties as well. ", "We liked the experience so much that we cut our 4 nights in Ubud short to go back. And this is where it changed for us! We did not like the jungle environment and felt the four seasons at Sayan was not as clean as it should be for a (very expensive) 5 star hotel. We went back. We wanted to stay another 3 nights at Mulia maybe the resort or the beachfront suites this time. We drove back from Ubud and upon arrival, looked for the familiar faces we left just a day and a half ago but found none. We were told there is another manager named Jason who will help us. We spoke to Jason, described the situation and that we left the four seasons for another three nights at Mulia. We asked him that since our stay at the previous hotel was non refundable and the fact that we chose Mulia from the hundreds of hotels across Bali to return to (on the same trip!) that maybe this (the situation not us) deserves a special rate. We would have taken any form of appreciation or a welcome back treatment.", "Unfortunately, we were greeted like unwanted outsiders and were treated like peasants asking for charity. It is not about the money. I left US $1000 per night at four seasons. They even offered us the best villa category at their other beach resort near the airport. If I was looking to save money I would have stayed at Sayan or have taken their offer and moved to the other four seasons. I refused as I was looking for Mulia and the Mulia experience. We were expecting a warm welcome but instead found a robotic, ice-cold and a careless manager who gave us the same rate found on their website but tried to present it as a special rate and then had the nerve to tell us to go to other hotels if we didn't like it! ", "Not even a smile. No apologies and zero empathy. It is never what we can afford, we stay and rent the best only regardless of the cost. However, it is all about the value and the service. ", "If you are lucky you will have the best hotel experience in the world. If you meet this guy, you won't. ", "Good luck!", "\n", "\nMulia villas is very good.", "All staff is very kindly.", "Clean room.", "Nice service.", "Beautiful location.", "We feel very nice.", "Good resort mulia.", "We are very miss you.", "luky, novin and joyce.", "Thank you.....................", ".......................................\n", "\nWe spent almost 3 weeks there and it was one of our most beautiful holiday we ever had. The place is amazing, including top technologies for everything around (hotel is only 2 years old). Breakfast is great with a big Chinese and Japan assortment, beside the traditional European one. Each villa has a big garden (around 300 s.m.),a nice terrace completely equipped for resting or dining and not at least its own pool where you can swim and spend entire day. However, the beach pool is even better, including the bar inside. Staff is very friendly and the butler you get is really doing the best to satisfy all your requests. At least our butler - Budi - did a great job and made us thinking to come again here, when we will be back in Bali. Restaurants are all fine, but try not to miss the Sunday brunch, if you love the good food and wine. And not at least, very different versus other tropical paradises, there are no insects inside the resort. Outside the resort,in turn, be prepared for the mosquito world and do not forget your repellent. Definitely, we will come back here again.\n", "\nThe rooms, pools, restaurants, food, beach everything was absolutely fantastic.

You will NOT regret stayin here at all and as humongous as this place is, you feel at home to the point that you really dont even desire to venture outside, what for? you got it all in one place, which I believe is part of the planning. Herein you feel the Balinese hospitality hands down the best service I have received, better than Park Hyatt Tokyo (and Japanese service isnt something to sneer at), almost a little overwhelming really esp for an American like me who is rather independent and to have so many staff quick and ready to assist you. Beach is amazingly clean, walked early in the morn and found staff out cleaning the shores! and oh! i walked late at night as well and staff where everywhere as well, cleaning and setting things up and so on, abit on the down side was the construction that prevented me from walkin pass a walkway so i", "could go further out, but that didnt bother me one bit. Even the toilet is hospitable! hahaha..what i mean by that is when you open the door to use the bathroom the commode cover opens up in welcome of your use of it! how cool is that! lol..u gotta experience it to believe it!", "Our room overlooking the beach was perfect. there was a jacuzzi outside that my friend used, there was a huge lounging chair/sofa in our balcony that i sat on as i appreciated the serenity of the early dawn (i was hoping for a nice view of sunrise, but lah! cloudy boohoo). the toiletries are yummy! i am partial to lavender and anything aromatherapy that i liked what we had in our rooms that i took the lotion with me, hehehe..", "spa is brilliant! i did mention to both the spa manager and the hotel manager that there should be free access for the guests to use at least the hydrotrherapy pool, think jacuzzi galore :)", "so if u ever get this service free, thank me! hahaha", " and the hot and cold sauna (i liked the ones in Athens so much that i wished all luxury hotel got them)", "and oh! not to forget Claudio the manager himself! the coolest manager ever! mind u i talk alot anyway, but i really felt like i was talkin to a friend! and yes, he is the manager! hahaha. i really truly loved it here, that i am already in the plans to take my parents and siblings and treat them to this high end hotel. yes, gotta save loads of money, but oh so so totally worth it!!! i cannot say it enough!cant u tell with all my exclamations?!? hahaha", "and like Arnold said...\"i'll be back!\"\n", "\nFrom the moment we arrived at the Mulia Villas, we fell in love with the place.

Best villa in bali I ever stayed . But somehow I never got informed about the free extra night after staying 2 night as the promo mentioned on this page.\n", "\nI think for vacationers looking to get away for a relaxing holiday, your resort (we stayed in the villas) is too strict, with too many rules and regulations. It leaves us with a somewhat unpleasant taste in our mouth everytime we are asked where we are going, how many people there are with us, where our kids and nannies are, where we eat, who we eat with, etc. My kids wanted to eat pizza in the villa because it was late and they were tired from playing all day, but of course, this wasn't allowed. We weren't even allowed to go to the restaurant to have the pizza packed and brought back to the villa. I really don't understand the logic behind this. ", "It was confusing in the beginning and became very annoying towards the end. I even met a couple of expats who were walking on the beach and trying to take a photo of the property and were being told that it was not allowed. I could see immediately the incredulous disappointment on their faces. I don't think this is the kind of image that Mulia wants portray being the \"best new hotel\" of 2013?", "I am not blaming any of the employees (butlers, etc) because they are the nicest people who are very apologetic of the whole situation, but I am definitely blaming whoever it is that is making the rules. ", "If you are asking for my honest suggestion, do what St. Regis next door is doing. Charge a bit extra and let the people who have spent their money there feel treated like kings/queens instead of a juvenile detention hall.\n", "\nThere's no question that staying in a villa at Mulia is expensive, but for those with the luxury of being able to afford it, I imagine it would be harder to find a better experience. We stayed for nine nights in a family villa, which includes two bedrooms in separate structures, the main bedroom of which has an enormous bathroom including jacuzzi (note that the two bedroom villa has two main bedrooms, with two jacuzzi). ", "The quality of the villa is unimaginable, with luxury furnishings, carpetings, curtains and bedding. Even the cot for our two year old was seemingly designed for a prince, with a nice mattress and plush pillow. Space is plentiful, with enough room in any of the areas for the four of us to stretch out and relax. There were a total of 20 places to sit throughout the villa! The villa is descended upon twice a day by a team of cleaners, who keep the inside spotless, the garden manicured and the pool sparkling (there was at one time five staff inside the villa compound all working hard). Fruit, water, and coffee capsules are all replenished twice daily.", "The bathroom is like a day spa, with a shower that spurts water both from above and from four shower heads on the wall, and a jacuzzi definitely large enough for two. The toilet has been well reviewed, and even though I knew what it involved, it was still fun. ", "The pool is much more than a plunge pool, probably about 8 metres long and 4 wide. There is a sort-of a wave generator at the end which can be turned on to make a moderate current, with the intention that you can swim in the current for exercise (although it's not really very strong or comfortable). ", "The resort itself is enormous, and the 5 or 10 minute walk to the beach is usually swapped for a buggy ride. The buggies can be booked to arrive punctually in advance, or ordered at any time with only a few minute wait, which is better than some similar properties we've stayed in where it can take 10 or 20 minutes to arrive. ", "The villa comes with butler service. You are assigned two butlers, one for the day shift and one for the evening. They seem to care for approximately four villas at any one time, so are usually immediately available to assist. Other butlers occasionally filled in at busy times. Our butlers were Ardi and Fenny, who were both amazing. Our son sorely misses Fenny, as they struck up quite a bond, such that we joked about offering her a job back home as our permanent nanny! We weren't entirely sure how to make best use of the butlers, but used them mainly to make reservations at restaurants (where they would make sure we had a great table) and the spa, co-ordinate taxis out of the resort, and got them to arrange specific things in our room---fresh milk for our child before bed, and chamomile tea. Ardi was happy to deliver our beach gear to the beach after our breakfast so that we didn't need to bring it all to the restaurant. We didn't ask for much, but both Ardi and Fenny predicted our needs and a lot of nice touches were done without us asking....we commented to Fenny that she seemed to know what we wanted before we did, and she replied, \"Yes, that's my job!\"", "The resort is massive, but there is no corner of it that is not finished with fine materials and furnishings. There must be hundreds of the extremely comfortable poolside lounges beside the six or so pools. The main pool is beachside, with a swim-up bar, and club-style music playing as the day draws to an end. There are two quieter pools in the middle of the resort, both large, and one with a swim-up bar. There is also a kids pool with blow-up toys, fountains and waterfalls, and well watched by a lifeguard. The beach was cleaned after each high tide by an army of staff, and was nice to swim in at high tide. We realised at the end of our stay that they have an aqua-sports desk, with paddle-boarding, kayak hire, diving tours and the like\u2014they should advertise this better as we would have used it if we\u2019d known.", "Between the three of us we used the day spa quite a few times. It is clearly an impressive facility, with an ice room and a state-of-the-art steam room. However, the physical experience and the therapy side of things was a bit lacking. The prices are on par with an expensive day spa in Australia, but then you pay a service charge and tax on top (totalling 21%), which makes it a bit of a rip-off. A one hour massage came to about A$120, as compared with $15 at Bali Collection, a $2.50 cab ride away---the ambience is not similar, but the price at Mulia is not justified.", "Kids club is well appointed and well staffed. As our son was under 3, we couldn\u2019t leave him there on his own, but we would have trusted the staff completely, security seemed very high. He had a great time with all of the facilities, including a large ball pit.", "Dining options were all spectacular. Breakfast was included, either buffet style at The Cafe, or a la carte at The Living Room. The Cafe was busy but never full, and even when full, there is an express lane for villa guests, such that you would never wait for a table. The food options are essentially endless, from the usual breakfast fare to sushi, sashimi, curry and steak. The Living Room actually presented a more enjoyable option for breakfast. An exclusive enclave for villa guests, it was usually almost empty at 8am when we came to eat, but always staffed with what seemed like a dozen wait staff, ready to satisfy your every whim. An extensive menu is available, and you may order as much or as many times as you wish. Items included crabcake benedict, fillet mignon with truffled poached egg or salmon and caviar scrambled eggs. Coffee was plentiful, although not up to par with the delicious food. On top of this, the staff offer you an endless array of extras, such as pastries, dumplings, miniature fruit platters. Even when we tried not to eat too much we ended up rolling out the door satisfyingly stuffed.", "The Living Room also serves afternoon tea and cocktails every afternoon. There is enough afternoon tea to make dinner unnecessary, although we usually couldn't resist dinner. A sweets trolley full of astounding delights is ripe for the picking, much to the daily delight of our two-year old. Cocktails are simple, and essentially are the most basic spirits with mixers. This represents one of the few dining experiences that could do with improvement--a high quality 'cocktail of the day' would be appreciated---the cocktails elsewhere in the resort were generally delicious.", "We also had dinner at The Cafe, Soleil and Edogin. I can't think of a single negative to say about any of those experiences. We were lucky enough to be at the resort while they held a special sake tasting dinner at Edogin, hosted by a Japanese sake master and the resort's beverage manager. The food was exquisite and delicate, and the sake almost free flowing, allegedly in the name of sake education. If there are any special food events happening while you visit, I would highly recommend them as an experience.", "Sunday Brunch at Soleil was astounding, and great value particularly if you partake in a cocktail or five.", "After dinner one night we thought we should use our complimentary drink at ZJs nightclub, expecting a quick drink and a lame experience, especially given that it's been quite a few years since we went clubbing. Instead, we rolled out of there at 1am after a great night. The resident band is truly excellent and must cater to most tastes, with everyone up dancing, including a mass stage invasion to participate in Gangnam Style. The only warning I have is that a hangover with a butler is still terrible.", "After all the eating, we definitely needed to work some calories off in the gym. Mulia Gym is, without any doubt, better than any gym I\u2019ve been to in Australia. Top of the line equipment, all brand new. These days, we\u2019re all used to having TV on our treadmills and bikes, but here they had internet---so you could check your Facebook while working up a sweat. The gym is enormous for a hotel (about 8 treadmills, 4 bikes etc), plus 20 or so weight machines, but was almost empty, with staff always outnumbering patrons.", "Our only significant let-down was that we booked a private day tour through the resort, which was provided by an outside operator. Rather than a comfortable car, we had an old, worn mini-bus with 20 seats, for the four of us. The guide recommended we visit a silver factory, a painting factory and the like, and was almost angry that we instead wanted to go to the zoo, the monkey forest and the markets in Ubud. It was clear that he was hoping for cashed-up travellers to visit his friends' stores so that he would make a commission. We stood our ground and were taken where we wanted, but the tour guide was sullen and unhelpful for the day. To give credit to the resort, the head concierge heard of our poor experience and tracked us down the following day with offers of discounts and a very sincere apology. He was mortified, and I have complete faith that they will demand improved service in the future.", "Overall, although expensive, I feel we got amazing value for money. The level of service is well above anything I have ever experienced in the past, and the quality of the room was astounding.\n", "\nStayed 2 nights in one bedroom villa.

They're excellent. 1)We wanted to attend lessons (in the gym) poof they helped set up with the instructors. Picked us punctually and even suggest where is convenient for our breakfast. After basking in the pool area for some time, the butlers felt that we might be bored and took initiative to invite us to the \"living room\" for high tea...( inclusive of the villa px) .

We originally booked to stay for a few nights but our experience was so enjoyable that we ended up staying for an extra couple of nights which I think says it all for the villa staff and service. It is a newer hotel so the accommodation and facilities are much nicer but it is also styled in a modern contemporary manner which may not appeal to those looking for a more Balinese style/experience. Highlights include excellent butler service, an excellent kids club catering for all ages, superb food and service at the Living room - honestly I still crave and think about the excellent food and service we got! - plus the warmth from all the staff.

The around the clock butler service, were so professional, yet making us feel like this was our home away from home. We stayed in a 1 bedroom garden villa and it was phenomenal. Luxury exudes this hotel. Jacuzzi, top of the range shower, and sensored toilet to name a few. There are so many areas around this resort for simply relaxing and enjoying the view, and we enjoyed them with cocktails. The secluded private plunge pool with in built hydrotherapy system was indescribable. There was even a pool daybed that literally was positioned inside our pool.

This great service continued throughout our stay no matter where we went - pool cabanas, pool bar, the beach or restaurants. The villas were amazing in terms of views, decor and spaciousness. All pools were quite incredible, especially the infinity pool in front of the suites. The resort is large but easily navigated with a chauffeured buggy from the villas. I just can't say enough about the service, the hotel manager even dropped by to see how our stay was going. A special thanks to our two butlers Wira and Satria, who were absolutely fantastic!

We were looking for a luxurious villas ; we hesitate among several resorts but I have to say that we were very satisfied and our stay was beyond our expectation ! First, the villas luxurious interior is more european style than asian and in anyway, the result is really wonderful ; it depends of course on the expected style of each customer but it matches exactly our requirement. Secondly, we were really surpised by the high quality of service (thank you, Agung & Yohanna, our main butlers, the service was perfect ! Gita, your advice during my daily fitness training were really helpfull). Why Mulia is not so well-known as other resorts as Four-Season ? Well, I guess the main reason is because the hotel is quite new. Anyway, it was a real good suprise !\n", "\nWe stayed in villas at 3 different Bali resorts during this trip (Mulia Villas, Samaya Ubud and Dusun Samayniak), and Mulia was by far the best among them. The resort site is vast -- probably the biggest in Bali. Mulia is almost brand new (just 5 months old) and the 2-bedroom family villa we stayed at is absolutely amazing with interior decorations and furnishings that rival any Banyan Trees, Four Seasons and Aman Resorts that we have tried before. The one thing that would have been nice to have is additional privacy in the villa's private pool, but the resort's site doesn't lend itself to offering complete 100% privacy. What makes Mulia outshine the others is its impeccable 7-star service. Everyone was absolutely friendly and helpful with lots of smiles, always addressing us by our names. And no matter where we went, the staff always somehow knew we were arriving and waited to greet us. And when we called a golf cart to go to lunch or dinner at the resort's restaurants, our 2 butlers (yes 2 butlers) stayed with us the whole time and made sure all our needs were addressed. And the response time for all our requests was very prompt, usually within 2 or 3 minutes. Truly amazing service! Three final comments: (1) the south american band at the ZJ Bar is very entertaining; (2) try Mulia's breakfast buffets at the Cafe; and (3) our butlers, Richard and Fenny, went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect -- hooray to them!\n", "\nI've been to Bali many many times, and I have to stay that we have the BEST experience during our stay at Mulia Villas. I traveled with my family, there were four of us, and we stayed in the family villa garden view. Unfortunately, our villa was the closest one to the main street so we could hear the sound of motorcycles passing by when we're sitting outside on the pavilion. Luckily it wasn't a crowded street so it didn't really bother us. ", "The villa was great in size, decor, atmosphere, and functionality. It is quiet enough for people traveling with families or couple, but you can easily go to the resort/ suite area for a more up beat atmosphere. ", "Everything was taken care of from the moment we land up to the moment of our departure at the airport. All the staffs paid special attention to the guests, we were never once left unattended during our stay. Whenever we traveled out of or into our villa, the staff made sure that transportation (buggy car) was ready at our service. All dining reservation for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner were taken care of, and the staff at the restaurants communicate very well with the staff at the villas to ensure our smooth experience. The coordination between all the staff is really amazing. ", "All the restaurants impressed us. the Living Room was our favorite spot for breakfast and afternoon tea, with different selection of traditional and modern food/ snacks. The buffet at the resort has the most extensive breakfast selection compared to any other hotels we've stayed in. Soleil is a great option for those who seek romantic dinner or brunch by the beach, with great French and Italian food selections. ", "It was an amazing experience overall, we can't wait to return!\n", "\n4 nights stay is not enoug for my wife and i. From the time we enter the resort villa until we depart, the service that we received is consistent. They have computer brain , every staff know us include the restaurant. Butler staff is superb. Polite manner and know what we want. What surprise us they know our favourite food and helped us to order. The villa facilities is super high class, big jacuzzy and big bed , luxurious decor. We plan to come back and stay again at this villa. Thank you for making our holiday great.\n", "\nStayed in one of the villas with my wife over a period of 6 days. We have chosen the Mulia for its opulence, as they present it\u2026 yet we found a resort which is just too big to give you anything close to what Bali should be. ", "The villa and in general the overall complex are brand new. There are still some very visible areas of fresh construction, as well as snagging going on. The general feeling of the Villa area is a very dense concentration of villas whereby the view from the patio of the bedroom can be summarized to a succession of villas and building and eventually the ocean, way down the hill. The room was well appointed, but pretty much standard for a villa category. The Living Room is a convenient concept, but the service lacked of consistency.", "The let down for us was very the size of the resort. Everything is big, just too big. The Caf\u00e9 was featuring a dense buffet with good value for money, but with 300+ seats and plenty of group/package guests eating and walking everywhere, this place was turned into a train station\u2026 noisy, with a chaotic atmosphere. Not a pleasant experience unless you just want to grab a quick meal and don\u2019t mind eating in a big hall which is rather impersonal.", "Soleil was better in terms of atmosphere, but once again totally oversized (got quoted by a waiter that it has 2 x 200 seats capacity between the two dining rooms?). The food here was ok, but the menu concept was kind of strange, featuring French/Italian Classic dishes, but also Thai or Vietnamese fares, as well as caviar?", "The Sky bar was not as spectacular as promoted. Trendy furniture on a plain roof top terrace. Lighting is poor \u2013 basically no atmosphere at all.", "Throughout the restaurants and bars, one can feel that the service employees have been trained\u2026 too trained. They appear very \u201cprogrammed\u201d as if they have to say what they have been told to say\u2026 this is very repetitive in all areas\u2026 it really lacked of warmth. They were also very pushy in promoting all their venues and food & beverage activities, to the extent that it became really hard to believe how aggressive they can be. In the same day, I must have been asked at least 10 times to book a brunch at Soleil\u2026 even the buggy drivers were very pressing about this brunch. We just felt hassled on some occasions.", "The overall complex look & feel is very urban\u2026 hardly any vegetation\u2026 just concrete everywhere. It reminded me these mega resorts that you can find in Middle East. The architecture is very modern\u2026 no connections to Bali and its culture\u2026 as stated by other reviewers\u2026 this hotel could be anywhere else in the world it would make any difference.", "For us, the stay was a disappointment. This hotel is possibly great for large tour groups or conventions\u2026 but its scale just makes it far too impersonal, no identity. The atmosphere is very cold\u2026 we did not find the spirit of Bali we were looking for. We will definitively not come back on a future trip and will rather check smaller properties such as St Regis, which I am sure, provide the warmth of a true Balinese atmosphere and service.\n", "\nUpon chosing Mulia Villas as our honeymoon resort, we thought we were taking some risk because Mulia was a newly-built one and we hardly found reviews on the internet. ", "However, our worries were soon disappered and we experienced perfect satisfaction for the five day honeymoon in Mulia Villas. Rooms and facilities including pools, gym, linving room(exclusive space for Villa guests) were beatiful and fully-equipped. The staffs were very professional and friendly.

The staff are attentive but non-intrusive, and nothing appears too much to request, however the personal butler service enhances individual luxury to another level.

The level of service we experienced was exemplary and the attention to detail really made us feel we were being treated to an individual luxury service, including our anniversary bottle of champagne and canap\u00e9s.

", "In addition, we did not need to sample some the local restaurants as a result of the impressive standards offered by the collection of in-house restaurants, including the superb Living Room that catered for breakfast,lunch and dinner in an array of local and international dishes and cuisines and the sophisticated Sky bar where the staff were more than accommodating to fulfil personal requests .", "To summarise this complex allows you to indulge in some of the highest levels of hospitality without being overly fussy.

In living room our needs were full fill with variety of quality bread, my kids love it. A friendly and skill full butlers were assigned, they always ready whenever we need them. We would definitely come back and recommend Mulia villa to others. Fantastic Resort....\n", "\nI just came back from a 3 nights stay at The Mulia & we stayed in a one bedroom villa. We initially booked the Grand Hyatt but changed our booking to The Mulia as we learned of this resort from an indonesia friend who had stayed there. The one bedroom villa is beautiful and new. It comes with a private pool in the courtyard which we enjoyed very much. The butler service was wonderful, our butlers speaks good english & their knowledge of the resort's facilities was very good. We had breakfast & afternoon tea at this place called the \"Living Room\" and it was awesome. Quality of food & service was great. Our bedroom is being cleaned and touched up all the time. The villa environment is pleasant & quiet. We ordered a private bbq dinner in our villa on the last night of our stay & it was done very nicely.", "Nevertheless, there were three shortcomings from our stay & I am stating them objectively. On our second night, the water heater in our villa was not working. It's 11pm. The duty manager offered 2 options to us, either to change to another one bedroom villa or go to another villa to take our bath/shower & return to our villa to sleep & they will repair the water heater the next day. We find both options unacceptable as we had our stuff in the villa, it was a hassle for us to pack our stuff to shift to another villa & to unpack them again. The second option was ridiculous. We could not accept going elsewhere to take our bath/shower & return to our villa after that. We were talking about 11pm at night. We felt that both options were convenient options for the staff to close the case with us but both options were not convenient for us. In the end, we decided to stay put & put up with the cold shower. The staff repaired the water heater the following morning. We requested for the email of the CEO of The Mulia so that we can write our feedback to him/her. The resort manager met up with us on the following morning instead. He sincerely apologised to us for the water heater incident and offered us free spa treatment for the day and a free late check-out. We accepted his apology and offer. ", "The other shortcoming was our dinner at their french restaurant called Soleil. We placed our order at 7:15pm. We ordered a soup, wine & a fish dish as main course. After we finished our soup & wine, we were told by the same waitress whom we placed our order with that our main course is \"out of stock\". The time was 8:20pm. Having been to many fine dining restaurants, we found this piece of news rather unusual and unpleasant. First of all, there were less than 10 tables of guests in the restaurant that evening. We knew this as a fact as we sat there from 7:15pm to 9:15pm. If the restaurant was busy, we can excuse the staff as they may be too tied up to look into our order. If a particular item on the menu is unavailable, we expect the waitress to know and advise us before we place our order. It is also quite absurd to have a regular item on the menu to be \"out of stock\". We suspected something was not quite right and that the waitress was not telling us the truth. Nevertheless, we had no choice but to continue with our dinner with another fish selection. We sat in the restaurant from 7:15pm & ended up having our main course at 8:45pm. Other diners who arrived after us had finished & left before us. As a gesture of apology, the cost of our main course was waived. We felt that the dining experience was unpleasant & could not simply be redeemed by giving us a free main course. This is not what we are looking for when we chose to dine in a french restaurant. We are not looking out for a free meal. We also found the speed of service to be slow. There were few diners & yet the speed of serving the dishes was slow. The waitress who served us was polite but she did not smile at us at all throughout the whole dinner. ", "The third shortcoming was my massage at the Spa on the last day of my stay. I had 2 girls massaging me at the same time. At the end of the massage, I went back to my room & discovered that the left side of my waist was sratched & it looked like a finger nail scratch. I did not give this feedback to the Spa Manager as I was tired & it was the last day of my stay. I did not want to go through the hassle of speaking to her. Nevertheless, I would like to make a note here that the Spa Manager was a very friendly & professional lady. We met her on the third day of our stay when we went to the Spa for treatment.", "Dispite the three shortcomings, we would want to go back to The Mulia for next Bali trip. This stay was a 7 out of 10 for us, there is room for improvement. Staff service was 8 out of 10, minus 1 point for the duty manager who initially managed our water heater incident poorly & minus 1 point for the waitress at Soliel. Nevertheless, 10 out of 10 points for our two butlers.\n", "\nThe Mulia Villas is part of a resort, hotel and villas complex....very impressive with over 600 rooms and 108 villas.

Nice view...must see.", "At the villa, we spent 3 days 2 nite....the villa is spacious and clean. The private pool is just a step away and I can't imagine I spent almost everyday in the pool! The bed is comfy....we have bulter service...2 bulters (Mutika and Hadi), one for the day shift while another for the nite shift. Their service is impeccable and attentive. The toilet, indoor jacuzzi, shower and dressing area is spacious. The toilet seat...awesome! It is heated...cannot imagine!", "Will visit Mulia Villas again!\n", "\nOur family loves Bali so much.. We visit Bali at least once every year.

Great things about her is not only she can speak Korean and make korean comfortable, but also very supportive for everything. She gave us little TIPs to enjoy our meal at 'The Cafe' and so on. Actually I was kind worried before we get there due to bad reviews from tripadvisor, but my fears were utterly groundless.

We will get back soon. ^^", "ps. It is shame that my english skill is not good enough to explain all the good things about Mulia.\n", "\nI have to say that our recent stay at Mulia Villa is one of the best vacation we ever had. My children could not stop talking about it. The service was impeccable and the minute we stepped out from the airport we were attended by Mulia staffs ensuring all our luggages are taken care of. The welcome at the Mulia Villa was overwhelming. We were welcome by at least 10 staffs. the welcome drinks were really refreshing and while i was sorting out our villa, our children were treated an afternoon tea at the living room. The canapes was superlicious. The daily complimentary afternoon tea at the living room should not be missed. Our family villa with 2 ensuite bedrooms was absolute gorgeous as i've always like Mulia's interior decor. Throughout our stay we were attended by 2 butlers Fenny and Ketut. Their service was impeccable and they had gone extra length to make sure our stay comfortable . They even looked after my youngest daughter Myreen when we had our tea. They were very attentive and helpful. We had our dinner on the 1st night at the Soleil , a restaurant by the beach and the food was really fantastic. The chef had even given us a complimentary baked pasta while we were waiting for our course. We had our breakfast at the Cafe almost everyday and the shashimi is not to be missed as the salmon is really fresh. There are a lot choices at the Cafe , though the spread may not be as varieties as Mulia Senayan but the food was really delicious.The staffs at the Cafe were very attentive especially Ati. My children really enjoyed the Mulia Kidz club and the staffs were very good with children. Me and my husband went to the Spa and massage was really worth trying. In short , there is nothing not to like at Mulia Bali except for one thing. on our last night, me and husband decided to check out ZJ's . the club was pretty empty as probably it was a weeknight but well ...what can i say about the band. though the song selection was not too bad but their vocal is certainly not up to standard, individually they are bad but as a group they are even worse. There is no coordination between singers, almost looked like they were in their own world. There was no interaction with the crowd ( well... 2 tables really not a crowd ). Everything about the band is just wrong...anyway, that aside we really had a fantastic time at the Mulia Villa...again we cant thank our butlers Fenny and Ketut enough for their excellent service, there are too many names to mention...Adam at the Villa, Made Wishnu at the living room...One recommendation though, we hope that Mulia will have activities for all ages of children after all it was a family resort...will i return to Mulia, absolutely...\n", "\nWe just back home after spent for 5 days stayed at Mulia Villa. The entire resort is so beautiful. we were welcome by the manager and 2 friendly staff. my daughter loves the aroma water and beautiful flower gave by villa staff. waited in the beautiful lobby where you can see the ocean, we were escorted to our villa with nice garden and great facilities. I like the bathroom is so huge.", "The restaurant where we had our breakfast in villa is beatiful too. staff are friendly. we love the local fruit displayed so many. The amazing one is our butler dusarde and ? sorry we forgot his name, they both make our holiday complete. they know what we need without ask. is like we are at home. this visit is my 4th visit to bali, but never had this amazing staff service. we want to stay longer. we will come back next time and stay in this villa. so amazing. Thank you\n", "\nIt was huge resort and still some of the building parts are under construction. But in general Mulia resort will the best resort ever in Nusa Dua Bali. When you are in feels you don't need to go anywhere coz everything is there. Great staff with the nice hospitality attitude.\n", "\nSpent 3 days at Amarterra it was Perfect. We had a one bedroom villa with our own private pool, and large living area. bathrooms with 2 outdoor showers. The property is only a 3 minute walk to Bali Collection and also 4 minutes walk to the beach which is very clean and not at all busy! Breakfasts were excellent, service very attentive and the staff were all very friendly. I had a two hours spa treatment were very restful and in a beautiful set up.\n", "\nThis was one of the best experiences we ever had in Bali and we are there quite often. Nusa Dua is a bit sterile but when you want to have a nice peaceful and quite vacation it is definitely the place to stay in bali especially if you have a family. The staff at the Amarterra were excellent and to clear up any doubts from previous reviews, we had a few issues during our stay but nothing to go into details about since they were immediately addressed by the staff. We were given awesome attention during out stay. Especially like to mention Indra and the drivers Budi and Oka. Also the private beach area is not expansive but it is a nice area for only Amarterra guest, if you are exiting the rear of the compound (opposite side of lobby area) it is about a 4-6 min walk down the road to the beach area, so hope that clears up some of the debate about the distance to this area. The staff was awesome and will just ride you there if you so wish. Enjoyed the food and the spa during our stay. Only one issue was one driver was not as firendly as Budi and Oka and it needs a mention since they both were so great it really stood out.", "All in all will definitely be returning.\n", "\nWe stayed here a year ago (July 2014) for our honeymoon and I forgot to write a review. Hopefully nothing has changed but when we stayed at this place it was lovely.", "We didn't want to go to Bali for our honeymoon as it has a reputation for being a cheap place to stay for Aussie's and comes with a bogan stigma. We have family in the airline industry and got too good to refuse offers on flights so decided to head to Bali but needed to find somewhere amazing to stay. This place is it! ", "Five stars - an amazing place for couples, especially for a honeymoon. We booked 10 nights, which we had to book as two stays to take advantage of a bonus night deal - as a result had to move rooms. Both Villas we stayed in were lovely, the only difference was one of the pools had a more established garden.", "Villas were large, clean and well appointed. It is Asia so the showers are always a bit dodgy but everything else was lovely. The Villas are very private. ", "The private pools are quite large and are overlooked with day beads for two. The outside living area is huge and has a mini bar and iPod connections.", "The resort itself is very pretty, and very quiet. A great place to go if you want to get away from everyone else. There is a communal pool out near the restaurant and we saw 2 people swim in it the entire time we were there.", "Staff were friendly and helpful. They provided welcome drinks on check in and performed a traditional ceremony when showing us our room.", "Location is great, only a short walk to the beach, close to the main shopping centre for supplies and a cheap cab ride to anywhere you need to go. The hotel will also arrange any transport for you if you need.", "The only downsides are:", "\u2022 lots of mosquitos. Wasn't an issue when we stayed but the hotel knows of the problem so they fog the area with some industrial chemical every afternoon. It stinks so either head out, or stay in the Villa when they do this.", "\u2022 The restaurant is very ordinary. It isn't sure what it wants to be - serving lots of different cuisines with a bit of a spin on each of them. A simpler menu would do wonders for the chefs. We had breakfast included for half our stay. It was ok, not great, but edible and if your package includes it worth it. We had dinner delivered room service twice and lunch a couple of times while swimming in our pool. Again quite ordinary for a five star venue.", "Our tip - head to The Mulia for lunch. Also Bonekka at St Regis is a must for anyone staying in Nusa Dua.", "A great place to stay!\n", "\nStayed for 2 nights at this magnificant tanquil property with wife and 3 year old son. ", "Pros: ", "1. Hospitality - Staff was very helpful as we needed to take care of sick son. Provided needed emergency care and was very helpful and friendly during the process.", "2. Beautiful property with lovely pool..very tranquil even despite being situtated in the middle of Nusa Dua. The pool inside the villa was great too for leisurely swimming.", "3. Location - convenient 10 minute walk to Bali Collection", "4. Food - Breakfast was the best breakfast we had during our stay in Bali. Also dinners were great too. The King Prawn dish and the cholocate dessert stood out.", "5. Spa - Great spa with very reasonable prices compared to other large hotel chain properties. Was very surprised with the quality but also the prices.", "Areas of Improvement was that the Villa was sort of dark with the trees. Also although we did not see much mosquitos, we did had to pay extra attention especially with young son. ", "Would definitely come back as this property stood out amongst the other high profile properites in Nusa Dua that we stayed.\n", "\nAmarterra Villas is a lovely place to stay. The staff, location and service is superb and the villas are spacious and private. My wife and I had a beautiful seven nights stay and would not hesitate to return. The only small criticism we have is that occasionally road traffic could be heard from our villa. Overall, we would recommend Amarterra Villas to couples, friends and small families looking for a relaxing break.\n", "\nThe best place to start holiday in Bali. The staff are ready to give the excellent service during our stay. Clean room, nice breakfast and relaxing Spa treatment. Just 3 minutes walk to the beach and closes shopping centre Bali Collection.

Thanks for lovely holiday all amarterra team.\n", "\nMy visit to Amarterra Villas is one of mixed impressions.", "Positives: Excellent staff (Polite and Attentive). Above average food and the villa was spacious. The pool is a nice size. ", "Negative: Poor water pressure and water has odour when you turn on the faucet on but subsides in a while. Water temperature is sometimes inconsistent. Minor technical let downs here and there, main shower didn't even work. Mosquitoes are a REAL problem and although fumigation is done daily and there's ample anti mosquito devices all over the villa, the sheer number of mosquitoes makes it a futile defence. Privacy is average but our experience were spoiled by noisy neighbours that had their deafening conversations late in the night. ", "Overall: Above average experience with plenty of potential to be a awesome place. Water pressure limited the ratings....no point having lovely Grohe rain showers and a big bathtub jacuzzi if the water pressure can't keep up. The Villas are slightly jaded and you get the impression that it needs some TLC. Good for families and location feels super safe and away from the crowded hustle of the city areas. There's Bali Collection within 5 minutes walking distance that hosts plenty of restaurants and supermarkets but expect to pay a lot more than other places.\n", "\nAmartera Villas generally amazing! Great service, attentive stuff, villa is very good and comfortable! Great swimming pool in the villa, never had to use public swimming pool which looked nice as well. Very tasty breakfast every morning, especially lobster benedict. Basically all hotel facilities are 5 star hotel standard. ", "The only facility which is not 5 star standard is the Beach Club. The beach itself is really good! The Beach Club staff is very nice BUT no good toilet in the beach... The toilet you need to use is a dirty filthy \"whole in the ground\" and you don't have anywhere to wash your hands and I'm not even talking about a tissue paper... This was a downside - 5 star hotel sends you to the Beach Club but does not provide facilities on the beach for their guests. Also, just a suggestion - Wifi on the beach could be a good addition as well.", "Also, some reviews have been on about Mosquitos in the hotel - we can definitely tell you that hotel has all sorts of ways to fight with these and you have nothing to worry about!\n", "\nThank you amarterra for making our trip so specail.. excellent villa's perfect surroundings so quite and romantic .. perfect service .. specail thanks to mr.Roni and the staff for making our stay at amarterra so unforgottable .. thank you all\n", "\nJust 5 minutes walk to Bali Collection and the each, entrance to the property was laid with beautiful water/ landscapes!

The outside area with a small dining table and lounge area was big enough we could have had a few people around for drinks. The pool is much bigger than a normal plunge pool, you have room to swim a few strokes up and down. We travelled with our baby and so spent quite a bit of time relaxing in the villa, and it was perfect for us.", "There are lots of nice touches like a mostly free minibar, and free bottled water. The staff were also very professional and friendly, it seemed like everyone knew our names which you don't get with a larger hotel.\n", "\nIt is very rare when you book accommodation that it looks exactly how it does in the pictures, and yet that's what we found here. We arrived to the staff waiting for us and greeted us with everything we needed to know, including a wonderful chilled ice tea. ", "Some of the wonderful aspects of this Resort is how friendly everyone is and how they want to make you feel comfortable. The 1 bedroom villa was exceptional down from the little things such as lots of powerpoints, plenty of lights and great array of toiletries, lots of fresh towels, we also received treats every day. The pool was impeccable and we were suprised by how big it was, lots of chairs/tables and the sunbed was amazing. Breakfast was filling and the restaurant was lovely.", "All in all a wonderfully relaxing experience and we will certainly tell people about these villas, I would certainly come back here. As we were leaving the staff took a photo with us and asked us if we had any feedback as this was a 2 year old establishment, we said it was all extremely positive and would return here.\n", "\nWe have stayed at many places, but this was in a class of its own! As our first family vacation, we stayed here for 5 nights with our 5 month old baby. From the fabulous main entrance and reception, our experience only got better each day. The check-in was smooth and courteous to our private villa with pool. The accommodation was impeccable with traditional Balinese decoration and all the modern amenities. Every villa has its own wifi and well-stocked free mini-bar. The breakfast was delicious and one of the largest spreads we've every seen. The staff were lovely and helpful, and even played and looked after our little one while we ate. The reception is fabulous, and will assist you with any enquiry, and even drove us to nearby destinations as needed. The property is not beach front, and its about 200m to the beach with their own private beach club. From the moment we arrived, it was heaven on earth! ", "Can't wait to return again.\n", "\nAwesome and fabulous main entrance and reception. Warm and friendly service. A bit far from the beach if you travel with kids. There is a free shuttle service around Nusa Dua Area. I'll go back there.\n", "\nWe had arranged to get the resort transport from the airport but found as we arrived the driver could not be found. We had to then call up the resort to locate him, and was told he was not waiting because he had been waiting for 2 hours (2 hours before the flight was to land..) the same thing happened when 2 others in our group who arrive on another plane tried to use the resort transport as well.", "The hotel is not on the beach, needs to be pointed out. You can get them to drive you or you can walk the 500m to their area of the Nusa Dua beach where they have the chairs/towels/water etc/.. However in our trip we only went to the beach once and spent all the remaining time in our personal pool or the larger resort pool both of which were clean and pretty empty of other people. ", "The hotel is also within walking distance to the Bali collection shopping centre (I didn't go there but there are clothes shops/restaurants, chemist, supermarket, etc..) ", "The resort is around 25min from the airport and when we got the driver sorted out everything went pretty smoothly. The rooms are well appointed but there are a few issues such as the blinds not working correctly but the outside sitting are and pool are fantastic especially for those with kids. The room also has it's own spa bath but we stopped using that because the smell of the water was off and there are 2 showers, one half outdoors and the other full outdoors these are a nice novelty to try. The grounds of the resort are kept very well with a large array of tropical plants and flowers to look at. There is also mosquito fogging there is your worried. ", "Only little thing other than the smelly spa water is I'm not a fan of having the toilet open in the bathroom (clear glass door only) . ", "Sleeping quality was no problem the beds are nice, however it can take a while for you to cool the room down after a hot day so make sure you have all the doors closed. ", "Food wise there is 1 restaurant in the resort this serves everything, the quality of the food I thought was great but the selection is limited, understandable as there were not too many people when we were staying (low season?) Breakfast is not a buffet but a selection of fruits, breads, cheese and a hot cooked meal. Again the quality was good but we found every morning to be pretty much the same food over again. With the above one bonus is that if you wish to go around Nusa Dua to try another resort/restaurant the staff will take you there in their resort van and pick you up free of charge so we were easily able to go around and try other places to eat.", "All in all it was a nice trip but you do have to pay top dollar for the privacy and atmosphere, this is not a hidden gem. The staff were very friendly, helpful and seemed to try to make conversation rather than being static all the time which was great.\n", "\nWe stayed here for a couple of nights for our first stop on the honeymoon. I've never stayed in this type of higher end accommodation before and was blown away, the place was immaculate and the villa very well appointed.", "The staff were the perfect balance of being very helpful without always being in your face. ", "The restaurant was nice though portion size was quite inconsistent across dishes (everything we had was tasty). Still got enough food but I found myself with food envy after my wife's mixed satay tray turned up! ", "Upon them knowing it was our honeymoon there were a few small but appreciated surprises for us as well. ", "\n", "\nWe're preparing to check out of Amarterra today and felt compelled to write a review. This has been our first trip to Bali, traveling with our kids, 10 & 18. The whole holiday has been fantastic from beginning to end. We went to Ubud first, staying 5 nights in the Maya Ubud resort, which we loved and thought could not be topped - but have been blown away by Amarterra. We chose a 2 room Villa, which was beautifully furnished and filled with luxurious amenities (5 TV's (!?), 2 baths (1 with Jacuzzi, 3 showers (1 outside) and beautiful outside lounge area), not to mention the enormous private pool between the 2 bedrooms. The layout of the resort and gardens is very well designed and beautifully maintained, with each villa encased in its own walled garden for complete privacy. ", "The staff are faultless, very warm and create a lovely atmosphere with a totally genuine desire to do everything they can for you. The stunning beach is a very short walk (less than 5 mins). Overall I'd say, whilst maintaining all the desirable aspects of a boutique style hotel/villa complex, Amarterra packs the punch of a leading, much larger resort in terms of what it delivers, in fact we had dinner a couple of times at the St.Regis, which is almost next door, whilst impressive, we all agreed we'd much rather stay here for all the aforementioned reasons. ", "HIGHLY recommended, GUTTED to be leaving - WILL BE BACK FOR SURE!\n", "\nWe stayed here for 7 nights as part of our honeymoon to Bali. From the moment we checked in, the staff were so helpful & welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble for them & service was always excellent. The villa was absolutely amazing! So much space & comfort! Daily fruit basket, free minibar, private pool & jacuzzi. The beach was only 5-6 minutes walk away & Bali collection was about 5-10 min walk away. The breakfast was of a very superior quality & you had the option of having it delivered to your villa..once again with fantastic service. This place is luxury. Thank you for a super lovely stay. We look forward to staying at other MGallery hotels.\n", "\nThe most acctractive is the private beach. U will have perfect view and food there! It's about 8 minutes' walk from our room to the beach. The outdoor swimming pool is cycling all day long. We had a lot of fun at Amarterra.\n", "\nOur stay at this villa was the second half of our Bali trip. We were very excited to arrive, after reading so many excellent reviews and expecting the best. It was a satisfactory stay, although our mishaps began before we even arrived.", "We paid our accommodation in full before arrival. However, luckily we noticed $330 AUD fee taken out of our account a day or two before our arrival. After making a phone call, we found the holding fee was to secure our room, which didn't make sense to us since we already paid in full weeks ago. So we agreed this fee is to be used as our deposit. ", "After some confusion we were kindly picked up from a different property in Nusa Dua and driven to Amarterra. Our check in was smooth and friendly. We were taken to our room and shown around by a very kind young man, and I enjoyed the traditional welcoming into our room. We were very pleased with the aesthetics and amenities of the villa, and excited to be there.", "We were surprised by heart shaped chocolate cake to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary. This was a lovely gesture and we were both excited for what was to come during our stay.", "When we returned to our villa later that night, we found there was no hot water from either shower. We weren't sure if this was normal or not, so we just dealt with it. The hot water was back on the next day. I believe there was just a problem that night.", "We had some problems with the internet being weak and dropping out all the time. We had some help to try fix it by putting in a modem, but still the internet was never very good in that villa. So far we expected better from a resort of this calibre.", "We also felt our villa wasn't 100% private. When inside our villa, we could see the door way of the opposite villa. We tried to block the view for the first few nights and didn't mention to management until later in our stay. We noted other villas with this kind of position, simply had a little grate/fence put up to block the view.", "Another mishap was when we returned back to our villa in the late afternoon from a day out. We noticed some music playing in our room, and figured it was just normal music playing throughout the resort. It was kind of loud but we couldn't turn it down or off ourselves. After a short time of being in our villa, we received a phone call mentioning a complaint from neighbouring villa about our music. We were confused about this because we couldn't control the music. My husband was trying everything possible to turn the music off. Yes it was coming from speakers in our villa, but we had no way to change it. We called reception back explaining this, and that it is not our music, and had to have a technician sent to our villa to see what the issue was. He kindly explained this is in-house music. We were dumbfounded that we were called regarding a complaint for music that is not under our control. Particularly that the phone call came from the location that the music is controlled from. This isn't want you want, when you come home, looking for serenity and relaxation.", "We proceeded to order room service for dinner. Before it arrived we smelt petrol and smoke. We actually called reception thinking it was a fire. It was not a fire, but the smoking for the mosquitos etc. Before we knew it our whole villa was filled with this smoke. It smelt so poisonous that we stayed inside the bedroom with doors closed. I just hoped it would clear by the time our dinner arrived. I know this is mentioned in the in-room information, however I didn't expect it to be to this extent. I recommend to plan to not be in your villa during this time, every day of your stay.", "We began eating our dinner (which was delicious!) and within 10 minutes of it being delivered, we had a phone call asking how it was. We were still eating and found this to be an interruption although I know they are just checking everything is ok. And then no less than a minute later, turn down service was at our door. I also understand this is just their schedule. At this point, after everything that had happened so far, I was so upset and frustrated with our Amarterra experience that I wanted to leave and go to another hotel. We even started searching for other available hotels to finish our stay in Bali.", "We decided to get out of the villa, as we actually couldn't stand being there. On our way out we decided to speak to reception about our issue with the visibility of our villa. We walked back to our villa to show what we meant, and were advised they will try to do something about it while we were out, or by the morning. ", "We got home a few hours later and were asked if we would like to change villas. I jumped at the opportunity because I was so unhappy with our experience in our original villa. We were taken to a identical villa in a different location. Here, we felt completely private and the internet was much better. I felt our first villa had a better quality of some items e.g. the mirrors in our second villa had some brown spots / ageing, in both the bathroom and the wardrobe. However it's just little things. I was just pleased that something was done to fix the situation. In fact, I wish we had said something sooner, instead of being unhappy in our villa. ", "I really enjoyed the food at Amarterra. The breakfast is very generous. Due to being out and about we didn't get to experience the spa unfortunately. The location is great. It is a short walk to Bali Collection which was handy. We walked to the beach club, which was underwhelming and we had no interest in staying for long or returning again. We found most staff courteous, helpful and friendly. ", "I'm not sure if we will stay here again, due to the vast choice of resorts and different areas to stay in Bali. We really appreciate the efforts by management to improve our stay. We know now to speak up if we are unhappy, because I truly feel the staff care about your stay and want you to have a good experience. Although we encountered some negative events, I feel the effort put into fixing things goes a long way. We booked 5 nights and stayed 4 (due to our departing flight around 10pm on the 5th night).\n", "\nThe best villa experience of my life !!! We stayed at the villa Magnolia...

They made special arrangements to make our stay special and memorable...\n", "\nUpon arrival to amarterra villas with my boyfriend we were given cold towels for the heat and iced tea. Our luggage was transported to our rooms for us while we checked in. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. They showed us around the hotel and our villas. When they found out we were in bali for my birthday they brought us a bottle of rose on the house! At nighttime they turn down the duvet covers so its ready to be slept in, its the litltle things like this that really make this hotel so special! Breakfast was delicious and so grand, we were given: fruit, cold meats and cheese, pastries, toasts and jams, muffins, and then a choice of a hot and cold dish!! The villas are kept to such a high standard they are absolutely beautiful. Both the private and main pool are kept clean and are lovely to swim in. The staff were so helpful when it came to booking activities and making our holiday the best it could be. The location was perfect, in a gated community with a private beach and nearby shops and restaurants (literally a 2 minute walk). It is really the most perfect hotel out there! And i think they have the staff to thank for that, simply wonderful!\n", "\nWOW.. Great property.. Great Villas... Amazing Staff...", "We stayed here for 2 nights.. and it left us craving for more...

It was the most expensive place we stayed over our two week trip, and while it was the biggest and most private place we stayed, we had far better service and food at places that were half the price of Armaterra. Their breakfast included a lot of store bought baked goods, and not a lot of fresh fruit, meat, or selection on hot entrees. We once ordered a caesar salad and chicken wings to our villa and while they nailed the chicken wings, whatever dressing was on that salad was not caesar. Our mini bar, which was stocked with complementary soda and snacks could have been stocked with a few beers or bottle of wine, and the bathroom toiletries were average, at best. In my experience, at Armaterra you're paying for the space.\n", "\nThis is the second time we have returned to this place.

The villas are well appointed with great comfort in its 200 sqm. Privacy and luxury are the most valuable features of these villas. Service is excellent and location is perfect for shopping and sunbathing. The only small weakness is breakfast that gives few choices and quality is a bit under the standard for this property. However, if I have to reccomend a place in Bali, this will be very close to the top of my shortlist. Definitely an excellent price per value choice.\n", "\nMy sister and I just recently finished our stay here and joked that it felt like we were crashing someone's honeymoon (this is a good thing).

The staff were absolutely amazing. Our preferences were remembered and we were greeted by name and with with smiles.

However I felt the water in the private pool was a bit too cold for our liking and we hardly used it. The common pool which was just round the corner was often empty and we swam there more often. My younger boy had his birthday while we were there and he was presented a birthday cake at the villa!", "Cons would be a lack of restaurant choices (there's only one) but the food was quite good. And we were served fresh fruits by the pool every afternoon. We also tried out the spa which was very relaxing other than the massage room being a bit too bright. The biggest put off I would say is the massive number of mosquitoes!!!

I have rarely come across a hotel in which every member of staff is so dedicated to the guests' wellbeing. They did everything they could to accommodate each and every one of our requests and were always extremely friendly and professional. The hotel and its villas are wonderful and it is one of the only places we came across in Bali to offer private villas with a large pool (i.e., one in which you can actually swim laps). On top of everything else, the hotel offers a fantastic breakfast (with European, American and Indonesian options to choose from) and a free mini bar. It does not face the beach but it has a dedicated area in the main Nusa Dua beach which is less than a 5-minute walk away. In all honesty, none of the other places we stayed at came even close to Amarterra!

Our single bedroom villa was clean and neat as you'd expect from a fairly new establishment. The outdoor showers are a novel idea and the individual pools for each villa make for a private and secluded holiday if that's what you want.

Lovely and very attentive staff, beautiful surroundings, the villa was very comfortable, practical and nicely decorated. We enjoyed our holiday very much and looking forward to coming back for more.\n", "\nWe stayd for 10 days in this paradise like enviroment. The atmosfere is calm and relaxing the food was tasty and service wery kind. Comfortable beds and bedsheets. The hotel staff listen to our needs and they take perfectly care of everything. Perfect place for relaxing holiday.\n", "\nWe had a fantastic stay at Amarterra Villa's with excellent location and a great quality service by the staff. The only drawback we faced is neither Indian food nor Vegetarian Food was available in the hotel kitchen.\n", "\nI was in three bedroom villa , the resort Located in Nusa Dua , each villa is a one bedroom and a bathroom , and one separate living room , with a swimming pool , the resort is quite very quiet , and it have its mean swimming pool which is almost empty , no room service , staff are friendly and nice , the environment is really nice , it is not near the beach you might need 15 minute walk to the beach , only a public peach , in my opinion if you are group you will like it , but the resort is soooooooo quite\n", "\nJust want to write shortly, that after reading many all kind reviews we are happy that we have spend at least 3 nights at their beautiful villa. We enjoyed our short stay a lot, although the hotel does not have a direct beach access, but it is just a very short walk to a wonderful beach!!! ", "We were amazed with a very professional restaurant staff!!! The restaurant atmosphere and food was fabulous.\n", "\nWe stayed at Amarterra in July 2014 and really enjoyed our stay. We booked for only one week and wanted to stay for longer. The resort was beautiful and each individual villa was luxuriously appointed and had its own private pool. The resort was also only a short 5min walk to the beach or the nearby shops and restaurants. It didn't bother us that the resort was not right on the beach because we used our private villa pool more often than the beach.", "There were only two things that were not perfect during our stay:", "Firstly, location seems to have lots of mosquitos and I was bitten many times during my stay. At times there were swarms of mosquitos that you had to try and keep away. The resort did their best to help and provided mosquito coils, mosquito repellant and insect zappers. The resort often also sprayed the area to kill some of them.", "Secondly, the spa did not have a receptionist at the time of our stay. We tried calling a few times with no answer and had to ask the receptionist to book for us. We noticed that while getting a massage the spa phone would often ring but there was no one to answer it. We mentioned this minor issue to the manager when we were checking out and he mentioned that the resort had just hired a new person to do that job so hopefully this will no longer be a problem.", "What made our stay 5 stars was the service that went above and beyond. Even though the shops were only 5min down the road the staff came to pick us up in the car because it had begun to rain. The beach is also only a five minute walk away and the staff often offered to drive us there. Every night when the staff came to turn down the beds they would also leave a unique snack such as chocolate cake or traditional Balinese sweets. When beside the main pool my husband was given a bell to ring if he wanted to order anything from the bar. A staff member even called most days to check if there was anything we needed.", "Overall, we fully enjoyed our stay here and we are definitely planning to return.\n", "\nNice Villa, especially the 3 bedrooms, name Orchid Villa and very very quite, good services, friendly employees, in each villa there is a swimming pool. I like living in Amarterra Villa *two thumbs up*\n", "\nWe booked two days in Nusa Dua, hoping to have a relaxed day sunbathing by the sea. But disappointly the hotel does not have a private beach and is a bit far from the public one (10 min walk from the hotel, and THAT IS far compared with all the other same-level hotels in Nusa Dua, most of which owned their private beach with just less than one-minute walk).", "The room is quite decent and have a beautiful swimming pool, free mini-bar, and a massage bathtub. I have to say the hotel is average as the price is a bit higher than any other hotels nearby.\n", "\nMy wife and I stayed in December for 6 nights in a one bedroom villa. There are many wonderful and enjoyable aspects of Amarterra Villas, which we will take away with us. The overall layout comprises running water, plenty of trees and greenery (with Indonesian and genus labels on each tree); with meandering pathways from reception to the restaurant and individual villas. ", "The villa was sensational which included your own private pool. The thought which has gone into the design of the complex and individual villas is very worthy of comment. The pool itself is not overly deep which other villas hotel complexes provide. Plus the ease of getting in and out of the pool is again a facet of the thought which the Amarterra Villas displays throughout and mirrors the care which the designers put into the Complex. Kudos there!", "The staff are wonderful and truly worked at ensuring that your stay is enjoyable. Sure, there are mosquitoes, but we are in the tropics and the onset of the monsoon season provides an excellent breeding environment for them. You simply take precautions: use the mosquito coils when outside, keep your villa doors closed, cover up and use an effective repellent spray.", "Breakfast is a fine affair with choices of Indonesian foods and your typical hot western foods. You are also provided with pastries and fresh fruits which was tastey. The choices for lunch and evening meals was a tad limited, however the meals provided are first class.", "The beach is only a short walk away and is supported by a cafe which sells cheap meals with a range of cold beverages. The beach is protected by a series of reefs which provides for a safe swimming spot.", "Overall, I rate Amarterra Villas very highly indeed. Service is exceptional and your privacy is assured. The Bali Collection is only a five minute walk away. It has many arts and craft shops as well as numerous designer shops. It is not as cheap as you may find outside of Nusa Dua, but it is far better quality and you are free to meander about totally unhassled. It also contains various restaurants which are all quite reasonably priced which was a pleasant surprise.", "Thanks to all the staff at Amarterra for a wonderful get away.", "Terima Kasih Banyak!\n", "\nWe travel quite a few times to Bali. But this is the 1st time for us to stay at Amarterra Villa. It was so wonderful resort with friendly staffs has made our family feel at home. ", "Nice bedrooms, long private pool, full room service and daily free refill of mini bar. We just spent time at the living room-watching TV, swimming, reading, snacking and chatting. We all love swimming at the pool villa rather than outside as the water is cooler.\n", "\nOverall it was a very peaceful experience for the family. The villas were spacious and welcoming, and it seemed that a lot of the guests chose to spend the day and eat their meals in their villas rather than use the common areas, which was fine for us since our family loved to use the large pool. In comparison to other resorts in Nusa Dua, this resort is very small which means it has a more personal feel. There is only one restaurant which has a quite limited selection, however the resort is a short walk from many other good restaurants. It is also 5 min walk from the beach, with dedicated sun beds set aside for guests. Overall a great experience for the family.\n", "\nWe stayed 8 nights in Amarterra villas. The villas consists of the large bedroom, spacious bathroom divided into main bathroom and double sink room, separate toilette and 2 showers (one is outside). But it is the outdoor area of the villa that is really spectacular: large hut which had sitting room with the TV and kitchen with a small dinning table. Fabulous, long swimming pool and cute cabana on top of the pool, where I spent most of the time. ", "Villas have room service twice a day and daily free refill of the mini bar. Particularly endearing touch was a magic food for good night which was delivered every night to every villa. ", "The best feature of this resort is perfect customer service. From the front desk hosts, to the restaurant staff, massage employees and the room service, every person in this resort provides the best and consistent customer service. We were very touched by the genuine and positive behaviours of all employees in this place. Special mention to Rai who welcomed us to Amarterra with such a great enthusiasm and was there to farewell us on the last day. ", "We do travel very often through East Asia and Pacific and stay in different resorts but this was by far the best experience with the friendlies service team and beautiful surroundings.\n", "\nI can only agree with the positive comments. The location is fantastic, the facilities luxurious, food delicious,attention to detail wonderful and the staff so welcoming and friendly in every way. For me it was the happy staff who made this holiday so different to others I have experienced. They are truly lovely. Thank you to each and everyone who works at Amarterra. In addition I felt so spoilt when I arrived at the beach to have a lounge ready and waiting with a cushion, towel and bottle of icy cold water. Thank you for a wonderful Balinese experience.\n", "\nI won't repeat the beauty of the villa as commented by many. I just want to iterate the mosquitoes issue. Please don't take it lightly!! They have plenty mosquotoes coils/sprays but please bring along your most powerful repellent as you have to reapply all the time. I use Lemon ecaulytus essential oil and work like miracle! Bali connection, the nearby shopping strip, is flooded with mosquitoes too. ", "The staff are full of smiles except the bell-boy on our last day. Amerterra has streamline the check out process. I have requested help to carry our luggage from the villas to the front desk 1 hour before our intended check out time (10am) as we have seniors and babies in our group. I told the reception to pick up the luggage from 1 villa specifically and checkout will be an hour later. We had line the bags at the villa entrance, instead of loading them, the unsmiling bell boy took it upon himself to do villa inspection by going through all 3 villa rooms. Thinking there was miscommunication, we approached him, he shooed us away and told us to check out now! Man, I was surprised at the level of unfriendliness because everyone was so friendly at Amerterra esp. the trainee lady at the front desk. Bewildered, we called reception to ask for checkout as it was uncomfortable to have a \"stranger\" walking around the villa. When waiting for the rest outside our villa, 2 staff came for rooms inspection, half of our bags remained unloaded, bell-boy was still busy. Once we arrived at reception, front desk gave us the OK sign, however we sat and waited additional 30 mins for The bags. Sigh. There must be a clearer segregation of work to avoid overlaps.\n", "\nFor a completely relaxing Bali holiday in sumptuous surroundings in up-market Nusa Dua, you can\u2019t go past staying in a well-appointed, luxurious Amarterra Villa. As these villas have been well described in previous posts I will concentrate on the other points which make a stay memorable.", "The gardens and the main pool are well kept and the pool looks spectacular at night with little lights highlighting the outline of the pool. The villas exude peace and quiet in a place of total relaxation. You are completely private as each villa is surrounded by walls, screens and lush vegetation. The private pool, the villa, the outdoor area and the surrounding gardens are immaculately clean and are efficiently maintained every day. There is also a turn down service every night.", "Room service is available in your villa all day but there is also a restaurant on site and we ate there a number of times. We found the food excellent and the chef is to be complimented. The service was exceptional and the food was always delivered with a beaming smile.", "Included in our tariff were wifi, breakfasts, which include a basket of croissants and cakes, a basket of fruit which is replenished every day, soft drinks, biscuits and nibbles, a coffee making machine and tea and two Indonesian delicacies each night.", "Sabar and his assistant Indra were always very attentive, ensuring that our every need was taken care of. They made a special effort to extend our stay until it was time to catch our late flight back to Australia, which we appreciated very much. I could not single out any of the staff as they were all wonderful. They were always smiling, happy, polite and very eager to help. We were taken to the Bali Collection a number of times by car and also were taken to and from our villa (Zingiber 1) by golf buggy. ", "My husband and I had a one-hour massage. Both of us felt relaxed afterwards and would thoroughly recommend a massage. The attendants were helpful and very talented. ", "The beach area is kept clean and hawkers are discouraged.

Beautiful big spa bath, inside and outside bathrooms, large screen tv outside smaller flat screen with DVD player inside, comfortable bed with mossie net, fresh fruit everyday& bottled water provided daily. Short walk to beautiful clean beach, towels, water and sun lounges provided for guests. My husband was pleased there was some nice glassy waves to surf. We hired some pushbikes from the hotel and explored our surroundings which was so much fun. Our spa experience was pure luxury which included 3 hours of pampering by profession staff. We even bought some of their coconut, organic products to bring home! It was hard to leave this place as it felt like home after 7 days.

Other restaurants and shops are within a few minutes walk if you turn right out of the beach gate.", "I loved the 'Amarterra Breakfast' with the different fruits, pastries and cakes each day although I had the museli and eggs benedict every day. We ate dinner in the restaurant once and were not impressed - the food was adequate but portions were small and you could get better elsewhere at half the price. We used the laundry service which was quick but there are cheaper services nearby.", "I only had one issue with the villa, which for a 5* International brand is a major one. It was the cleanliness of the villa. As soon as I entered the property I could see it had not been cleaned properly. The glass doors (on entering the bedroom and all around the toilet/shower area) were all streaked, hand prints on glass and mirrors, soap scum etc, hair on the floor, the vanity area didn't look as if it had been cleaned for a while, all the TV screens had been cleaned with dirty cloths leaving smears all over them.

The villa included a pool and an outdoor living area that perfectly reflected the true Bali style. The indoor bedroom area was spacious and beautifully appointed. The grounds of the resort were meticulously cared for and contained an amazing array of flora representing the region. I save the best for last. The staff and service was fantastic. They couldn't be more accommodating and were genuinely warm and friendly in the true Balinese tradition. The bar and restaurant was world class. My wife and I loved watching the sunset over the main pool area while sipping a tropical cocktail and enjoying a scrumptious complimentary samosa or other delight. I would have expected such a six star holiday to be very expensive, but the prices were extremely reasonable and fantastic value for money. My wife and I rarely repeat holidays, but we will be back to the Amaterra next year for sure!

They can't do enough for you. ", "We arrived at 3am on a Monday morning after a late flight from NE Asia, and from the moment we were warmly greeted in the majestic reception, we were made to feel truly valued. We were greeted everyday with warmth... not your typical \"Nice day sir?\", but something like \"How was your rafting experience today Mr. and Mrs. Fisher? Did you enjoy the scenery?\"... they took the time to remember what we were doing, and seemed genuinely interested in making our stay as good as it could possibly be.", "When they found out it was our honeymoon, we had a surprise cake delivered to the villa, and the place was decorated beautifully for us. This would normally have been enough and may not distinguish Amarterra from other high-end hotels, but they kept the level of service and surprise right up throughout the stay. On returning from dinner on our final night, we were greeted by a warm bath sprinkled with rose petals and a bottle of wine from them.", "It seems almost unkind to single out one member of staff for praise, as they are all so extraordinarily good. However, I will mention Sabar, the Front Office Manager. This man was clearly born to work in the service industry - what a superstar!

We had been to Nusa Dua before and loved that it was a type of gated community with all 5 stars resorts and hotels within. The last holiday we stayed in a large hotel but this time we opted for a more private retreat and that is exactly what we found. Within our villa we had 2 separate dwellings which were stunning. Our 2 children had there own \"home\" (we called it) with there own bedroom 2 king single beds, walk in wardrobe and bathroom a real novelty for them was the TV over the huge bath. We had the same in our \"home\" but ours had a king sized bed, a spa bath and 2 outdoor showers! Both dwellings were fully air conditioned. ", "The gorgeous courtyard between both buildings housed our shared outdoor lounge and dining area with large screen TV, fridge (which was filled daily with complimentary drinks and snacks) all overlooking our own private swimming pool. Meals can be eaten in the restaurant or within the villa, our package included a full breakfast. The service was outstanding and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. ", "My daughter and I spoiled our selves with 2 visits to the day spa our last visit was over 3 hours of relaxing and pampering. Although we didn't use it as much as we should have the whole family did use the gym a couple of times. This is not air conditioned but there is a large fan. There is a short walk to the beach but if you wish the staff will drive you and arrange with the beach attendant to pick you up when you're done. A short walk away is The Bali Collection shopping center with restaurants, supermarkets and retail shops very handy and again frequented by myself and my daughter most days. ", "This gorgeous retreat is quiet and relaxing, more suited to families with older children like ours or couples looking for seclusion.", "I must again mention the staff who are happy to assist in any way like organizing transport making reservations at other places and generally making your stay wonderful. The manager Sabar was my favorite. He personally came to meet us at breakfast to welcome us and apologize as he was not there the day we arrived. He was so charming and delivered a beautiful teddy bear to my daughter's room. He would quite often come out to the reception area to greet us warmly to see what our plans were for the day and to see if we needed anything. Thank you Sabar.\n", "\nWe spent 8 nights in Amarterra at the end of september and it was simply amazing, we had a fantastic private pool villa (they ONLY have villas with private pool), that was a lot better than what the website shows and we spent almost all our time there, enjoying the swimming pool.", "The staff was really helpful both to prepare my food (I am celiac) and our baby's food (was 8 months old, so we needed everything pureed) and were just perfect, we just had a tiny little problem one day and they immediately gave us a bottle of champagne as a sign of \"sorry\".", "We will definitely go there again.\n", "\nI booked this villa after being wowed by the photos and the availability of private villas.

Everyone at the resort was intent upon making our stay a truly memorable one, and they did.\n", "\nWe have just returned from an 8 day memorable stay. The whole experience was fantastic: the night time arrival with the subtle, elegant lighting and journey by golf buggy to the villa. The staff at all levels cannot do enough to please and special thanks go to Sabar, the front office manager, who was most helpful in arranging an extended check out time because of our late night flight home, and Daywa (?) of the reception staff. As it was a special birthday, we had the poolside degustation, complete with birthday cake, (7 courses plus a cake ??) which was magnificent. Down at the Beach Club, the Warung Yasa Segara restaurant serves the best seafood, and also the restaurants at the Balli Collection which is a 10 minute walk from the villas, were extensive and very reasonably priced considering their location. Nusa Dua is not 'typical Bali' as it is a purpose built area for tourism but it is beautifully laid out and exotic. Amarterra Villas is probably the smallest of the developments here but that makes it even more special; the fact there were no kids running about made for a very peaceful atmosphere ! Amarterra is very special and a jewel in the 'M Collection\" crown. We would recommend it to anyone.\n", "\nYou will not be disappointed in anyway shape or form with Amarterra. It is simply heavenly.", "We stayed here for 1 week in September for our honeymoon and could not have been happier with our choice. From the moment you arrive you are in awe of the remarkable reception/arrival area, then you get your first contact with the staff at Amarterra on the front desk and they could not be nicer. The staff at this place are the best I have come across anywhere in the world, and I travel a lot.

Gorgeous pool and outdoor relaxing area is the main attraction but everything is thought of- outdoor shower, ipod docking station, TV in the bath, walk in wardrobe, coffee machine, the list goes on. You could in fact spend all your time in the villa but when you want to go out there is a stunning beach just a 5 minute walk away and a luxury shopping centre with dozens of restaurants 5 minutes in the other direction.", "I would recommend eating at the hotel though as the food was first class!", "We will be going back for an anniversary for sure.\n", "\nFantastic villa and resort...stayed here 4 nights...villa had everything u needed...3 tv's and huge spa and pool, out door n indoor shower...Every night they leave u a little surprise!

Highly recommend this place for all couples that want to relax in luxury\n", "\nA fabulous place to enjoy a relaxing and superbly comfortable time. At check in we were welcomed by brilliant Resort Manager Sabar Sitompul and he promised we would have a wonderful time. Our expectations were totally exceeded. The staff (at every level) were genuinely friendly and wanted to assist in any way possible. Sabar chatted with us every time we met and even walked us to our car when we left. Our villa (Bougenvilea 1) was georgeous and kept immaculately clean. Overall the eight night stay was excellent value for money. ", "The nearby (easy 5 minute walk) shopping area called Bali Collection offers many and varied shopping and restaurants. .\n", "\nThe staff are so very attentive, polite and welcoming. Every single one of them from gardeners to pool staff to restaurant staff and front office staff they always said 'Hello' when they met you anywhere on the property or even outside when walking to the beach. The whole property is kept immaculate. Room service was exceptionally prompt. The set menu breakfast is amazing - do set aside more than 1 hour to partake in this degustation. The beach club is special and private and comes with free cold water! We loved coming back to the villa throughout the day jumping in to our private pool and then trekking off again to the beach, local town shops & restaurants or the Bali Collection. All of these were in easy walking distance. We also hired a bike form the complex and rode the boardwalk to the blowhole. It is not strenuous and the views are well worth the one hour ride there and back. There is a show called 'Devadan' in nearby Bali Collection shopping centre and is a MUST see. Pay the price it is SPECTACULAR!!!!!!!!!! worth every rupiah. Transport was provided free by Amarterra to get there and it is a short walk home on a warm balmy evening.\n", "\nWe had a lovely, quiet, private stay here at Amarterra. It was our first time here and we will be back. The staff were friendly, helpful and the service was efficient. The day spa is heavenly and priced well. The private pool villas are a perfect retreat. We've been to Bali many times and loved this hotel!\n", "\nSimply a fantastic resort, well deserving of it's 5 stars. We had a 2BR villa which was actually two separate villas with a shared pool and outdoor living room. Each villa is very private. This is great and not so great if you enjoy being around other people. At this resort, you will not be in contact with other guests. It's that private, and I loved it. My wife is the extrovert. ", "The pool area was ok, not spectacular. We didn't eat at the resort rather the convenient mall across the street with plenty of reasonable places. ", "The hotel is not on the beach and we knew that when booking it. You walk down a \"path\", which is a paved road behind the hotel which wasn't the best.", "The beach area for the hotel is much to be desired. An attendant wasn't attentive, chairs were just ok, no water or service you would get from other resorts. ", "Service was the best I've ever had and I spend 150 nights in a hotel annually. Just superb. They know you by name. ", "Overall, loved it\n", "\nLoved the villa it was very spacious both inside and outside. The minibar and snacks is complimentary and gets topped up each day. The staff are extremely friendly and attentive, couldn't have asked for more from them. Customer service is impeccable and all queries/issues were dealt with very quickly, you're made to feel like you're their number one priority. There's a lovely beach just 5 minutes walk although the hotel will also drop you off in car.\n", "\nLuxury plus on a tradition level. Staff beautiful. Only whinge would be the breakfast is very average. Spa lovely. Rooms delightful. Felt very special. A must if you want private villa. Nusa Dua fabulous. A bit like the real Bali with frogs, squirrels, birdlife etc. private pool great and nice temperature.\n", "\nMy wife and I stayed at the Amarterra Villas in Nusa Dua during our honeymoon trip. We liked our Villa and the excellent service a lot. ", "There were only three downsides: ", "1) The resort is not directly located at the beach. It will take you about 5 minutes to walk to the beach from the villas. A free shuttle service was also available. ", "2) Don't have dinner at the restaurant at the resort - although its rather cheap compared to other Nusa Dua restaurants, I didn't think the food was worth the money (service was excellent though). ", "3) Upon arrival an amount on our credit card limit was frozen to make sure we would be able to pay at check out. After paying our bills at check out this amount was not immediately released - billing was correct though in the end. Just make sure you have a high enough credit card limit, so you don't run into problems on onward journeys...", "We especially liked the cordially reception and service throughout our stay, the free daily refilled minbar, and last but not least our wonderful and beautiful villa with a huge pool, a large bathtub, and two outdoor showers. I think the price is absolutely reasonable.\n", "\nNicest hotel we have stayed in. Beautiful room and pools. Service was great. They provide a shuttle bus to the private section of the beach although can walk this in 5 minutes. Evening meal was lovely - best duck I have ever had. Only complaint was we asked the meal to be served at a specific time and they were an hour late although did give us two free margaritas for the inconvenience. Breakfast was nice also. Absolutely stunning hotel and enjoyed food however isn't a great area as is built for tourists staying at resorts. I would recommend staying here for a few nights at the beginning or end of your holiday so you can see the real Bali in different areas also.\n", "\nit was my honey moon really i loved the villa , they dealing with you by hot welcoming , they did for me 1am check in , and free transportation to bali collection really Amazing, they renting bicycle with beautiful colors\n", "\nAmarterra Is a great boutique hotel in all villa style property. Its not located on the beach however a short walk or buggy ride will take you to the beach where Amarterra have a private area with sunbeds and water/towel service for its guests.

Rooms feature indoor/outdoor showers and tub with jacuzzi. ASk for a room closer to the pool and restaurant to be closer to everything. ", "The staff is extremely sweet and accomodating.

Off the bedroom was the enormous bathroom with spa bath, spacious outdoor & indoor showers. ", "Pavilion 2 had two twin beds with the same amenities as above & another enormous bathroom but with no outdoor shower. The layout is perfect for families or two couples. The free Wi-Fi was excellent & the air-conditioning too.", "Facilities - Large swimming pool with plenty of deck chairs. Spa, gym, & bicycle hire. ", "Beach - A 5 minute walk down the road to own private beach area. Tip - Warung Yasa Segara caf\u00e9 is cheap offering excellent seafood & Indonesian cuisine. ", "Restaurant - Large Balinese style restaurant offering local & International cuisine. A outdoor bar is attached. Food was okay but a little pricey, we found eating outside to be the better option.

Every email was responded to very quickly and nothing was too much trouble. This attitude extended for the duration of our stay.", "We arrived at midnight so I expected there to be some issues at check in - there were none. Every staff member we had an interaction with was friendly and had exceptional English skills. We were transported to our room by buggy where we were given a personal tour of the resort and the amenities in the room. I thought this was a nice touch as it saves you looking for things you need during your stay.", "Unlike other places we have stayed, this was a couples resort and gave us exactly what we expected - a romantic getaway. Young children aren't allowed so you really only see other couples, when you see anyone at all. Most of the time you feel like you are the only guests. It is very quiet both in the villa and throughout the resort.", "The pictures depict exactly what we saw in terms of room quality. The outdoor showers, deep Jacuzzi and high end vanity items round out the bathroom that is cladded in granite and sandstone. From the Jacuzzi, you overlook the pool, deck chairs and outdoor living area. Under that roof you will find a TV, coffee machine and music dock.", "We would wake up, make some coffee, plug a phone into the dock and lie in the sun all day by the pool listening to music. We walked down to the beach once to check out the private beach club. I agree with other comments that it isn't the best beach club we have seen, but it really isn't why we booked this resort. Compared to paying 3-4 times the price to stay in a villa at the St Regis or Mulia, beach access was adequate.", "Room service was quick (15-20 mins max) and they were happy to take orders for items that didn't exist on the menu. The menu wasn't extensive but it was enough for the stay and very reasonably priced. Presentation was exceptional and was setup by the pool or in your room. (Pictures Below)", "We decided to attend the romantic dinner by the main pool on the Wednesday night. There was a 5 or 7 course degustation, we opted for the 5 course with a bottle of champagne. It was a fine dining setting with lanterns hanging from the trees above. I would rate the food 8/10 but the atmosphere more than makes up for a not so perfect score. The service was impeccable, always there when you needed them, but still very private. (Pictures Below)", "My wife attended the spa on 3 of the 5 days and was very impressed. The staff were very attentive and she was surprised at the skills of the masseuse. She was so impressed, she requested the same masseuse for the next day. She wasn't working at that time so they changed her shift start time by four hours to accommodate!!!", "Overall, our view is that the staff make or break a resort. In this case, we have seen worse service at double the price and never such a willingness to make changes to accommodate every request. Accompanied with it being a tranquil, quiet and private resort it really is a great destination. The relaxation is like nothing we have experienced and it is surprising that it is walking distance to other resorts and the Bali Collection.", "I recommend this resort to couples interested in a romantic getaway, or even two couples in a 2 bedroom villa who would like to stay away from the crowds. You will not be disappointed.\n", "\nAmarterra Villas is the nicest Hotel that I have stayed in. It is a beautifull property that stuns from the moment you arrive, The private villas are great and are located near the restaurant ,gym and spa.

The villas are very well appointed with outdoor seating, TV, music centre, pool and lounge areas. Inside the large room has a walk in wardrobe, TV in the bedroom and bathroom, wifi, desk and much more. Complimentary soft drinks, fruit basket and snacks are provided daily and you will not go hungry! The breakfast is an a la carte which includes fruit, sweet pastries, toast, fruit juice etc and then on top of this you can choose cereal or yoghurt plus a cooked option. You won't be able to eat it all! Meals and drinks are discounted with an Accor card or the Bali Collection complex is only a 5 minute walk away for other evening dining options. The beach is a short walk down the road with sunbeds provided but to be quite honest why bother when you can choose between the stunning pool ( which we often had to ourselves) or your own private pool. We also had a massage at the spa which wasn't as good as the one we had in Ubud but was relaxing before we left for our flight.", "A mention has to go to Wati who was an excellent waitress in the restaurant - she remembered our coffee orders and asked if we would like the same bottle of wine on the second night of our stay. Thanks Wati for your friendly smile and great service. The other mention goes to Oka who drove us to the airport - we had a great conversation in the car. It's always good to learn more about the country you are staying in - thanks for sharing.\n", "\nAm quite a laid back character but during my time at the Amarterra I was anything but due to the problems I had during my stay.

My husband and I were looking for luxury villa in Nusa Dua to celebrate our anniversary and from the very moment we arrived we were blown away. The entrance is magnificent for starters and the villa itself leaves little to be desired. The private pool with your own cabana and outdoor lounge area surrounded by plumeria trees is amazing, we spent a good majority of our time there. In addition, the overflow hot tub and outdoor shower was a nice bonus! I would suggest having their daily breakfast and then you can either eat at their restaurant for other meals or just walk a mere five minutes to Bali Collection for other options. One quick thing to note which many other reviews also mentioned; it would be wise to specify a room away from the road/construction, which means you want to be closer to the main pool and farther from the beach access door. We stayed at Rosa 3 and it was a bit noisy during the day.\n", "\nWe cellebrated our 50th anniversary at Amarterra Villas and good not have made a better choice, we were looked after very well the staff is excellent and honest.Food was good and the villas were great and well serviced.\n", "\nA real paradise where everything is done to satisfy you.

The villas are just astonishing. Relax in your own private pool . Or take a jacuzzi in your magnificent Bathroom with a 3rd TV set in front of you. The staff spoils you any time of the day or night. Just a little bit disappointing are the beach facilities that are not run by the hotel , as well the distance from the beach, but we knew it by looking at the location with Google earth before booking. Anyway you don't need the beach when you can enjoy a private pool or a huge common pool.\n", "\nThis hotel is a very small resort very different from other large units with plenty of tourists. You get the impression it is really your private resort and other guests do not disturb you (you do not need to reserve your deck chair early morning for example). The villas are very pleasant with their private garden and swimming pool. The bedrooms are extremely comfortable. The service is extraordinary. Details are handled with high care and the staff is always smiling and willing to help. The food at the restaurant is really excellent. It corresponds to gastronomic standards. Environment is very typical of Bali with luxuriant vegetation.", "One negative point that was not really important for us: the beach does not deserve five stars. It is a small area in a public beach and there is a five minutes walk to reach it on a road with cars and motorcycles. There are waves most of the time in the sea and it is not pleasant to swim there.\n", "\nFrom the moment we drove into Amarterra Villas we were wow'd. The whole experience here was fantastic from the service by staff, always going that extra step and beyond, to the actual location and facilities. The villas were amazing and kept very clean. With a short 5 minute walk to the beach and to be able to relax at the beach club, we were very satisfied with our stay. I highly recommend this to all staying in Bali. I cannot fault this and have made very special memories here. Thank you to all of the staff who also helped make our engagement beautiful.\n", "\nOur stay was an incredible experience. Firstly , the staff, we could not believe how welcome they all made us feel, from the check in staff, restaurant, room service, cleaners, pool cleaners, spa staff,they all had the same positive and welcoming attitude, they enjoy their work and looking after their guests.The Villa was very comfortable, we had no reason to leave the resort during our one week stay, other than just visit a few of the close by restaurants at Nusa Dua.This is a five star resort at reasonable prices,we have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this outstanding facility.", "We will return!\n", "\nWe stayed for 2 weeks at Amarterra Villas.

The weather in July was perfect for us; clear blue skies, dry and hot without wing uncomfortable.", "The food at the hotel was absolutely fantastic. Better than that at the St Regis (which is meant to be the best in Bali...we disagreed). The dinner was outstanding, especially the lobster! The staff are very attentive and friendly and the food is very reasonably priced. If you wanted a cheaper dinner however It's less than a 10 minute walk to the Bali Collection, which has lots of restaurants with bands and a bit of nightlife.", "The holiday was extremely special and we came away not wanting to leave!

The Villas provide everything to combat these- coils, etc but they just didn't work.

The strengths of Amarterra are in its location - 5 minute walk to 'Bali Collection' (centre with many restaurants & shops); 5 minute walk to beach; fantastic garden setting & the delightful staff. Service was great - anything we needed was promptly provided; rooms were checked / serviced twice daily; communication (english) with staff was easy & polite. All facilities are clean & functional and of good quality. Amarterra is also convenient in that you reap the benefits of Nusa Dua generally (less hassle & hawkers), as well as having beautiful strips of clean surf beach to wander & explore. The private villa option also meant we did not feel as if we were lost in the larger, less personal 'super hotels' -that are your neighbours but paying twice as much as you. Of note, Amarterra offers FREE refreshments in your bar fridge (unheard of!), and stocks replaced daily. No alcohol - but waters, softdrink, chips and good pod coffee machine. In terms of food at restaurant,.. we had breakfast at the restaurant each morning - good coffee and delicious french toast. I also had a Rejuvenation treatment at the resort Spa which was well worth it.", "Overall,.. a beautiful place to stay - would definitely go back there and would highly recommend Amarterra as a place to stay if you are going to Nusa Dua.\n", "\nMore than you Can Dream off ", "The Villas Are fantastic and All the staff Are the Best you Can ask fore.

We were welcomed with Bali's traditional welcome and as a surprise, you will also get a complimentary honeymoon cake. We were in an awe when we saw the villa. A sitting area with Television and music, a private pool, beautiful interiors, jacuzzi, outdoor shower - what else do you want? The service was exceptional and so was the breakfast. They will treat you like king and queen. They even went an extra mile to give me a surprise on my birthday. The staff - from front office to housekeeping to even security is extremely helpful.

The resort will arrange transfer to the beach in their golf buggies, or it's a 5 minute walk. We would recommend the breakfast as their are not many places around that do a good breakie.

The decor is perfect and so tranquil. I loved being able to leave the busy towns and come back to our private pool and outdoor living space. I would recommend it to anyone going to Bali & definitely include the breakfast! Was nice to wake up and have an amazing breakfast of your choice delivered to the outdoor living area. The beach is right down the street and they have very comfy lounge chairs to lay out on. Loved Amarterra! Miss it already!\n", "\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our 8 night stay here. The staff are wonderful and nothing is too much trouble. We felt like royalty and have travelled far and wide in our 44 years of marriage and these Villas are on the top of the list! Private, spacious, and very clean villas made our stay feel like our own private paradise. Sabar, Nella and Dini on reception always welcomed us with our names and were a delight. Wati and Dita Yoga in the restaurant remembered our favourite orders without asking. Puti Adi in the spa gave the most heartfelt massages. We will be doing everything to be able to return here again next year. Thank you so much\u2026.\n", "\nAnother stay and another fantastic experience. Cannot fault anything with this resort. As well as the location and the facilities provided, the service provided by the staff is one of the main attractions - they go out of their way, all discretely, to make you feel welcome. The recent review by M L sums up perfectly my views, especially about those complaining about mosquitoes - well said!\n", "\nWe stayed here for 4 nights and it was fantastic. An awesome place to relax, very accessible, fantastic clean amenities, the staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. We are more than satisfied and would highly recommend choosing this resort.\n", "\nI have nothing but Great things to say about the hotel, the staff, the island of Bali and of course the people. I travel a lot for work and for leisure and this hotel is by far the best I've ever been to and have satisfied me in every aspect.", "Pros:", "-Super friendly staff who go out of their way to help you with anything", "-Great villas, great rooms, great amenities and features", "-The villas are huge, the space is huge, the perks are endless", "On a special note, there are reviews here of people complaining about mosquitoes. Seriously folks, you're in a tropical country, you are shocked there are mosquitoes? If you are scared of them, go to a country that is below zero. You won't get insects there. Amarterra provides repellents and all the necessary insecticides you need to get the critters under control. If you don't know how to use them, just ask the staff. Do not make a bad review just because you got bitten my bugs. We never had a problem with the mosquitoes because it was so easy to get the repellents working.", "I have to make a special mention to Fauz and Dini. They made our stay extra special.

I want to thank the staff at Amarterra for making our stay just simply perfect.\n", "\nI loved everything about this hotel. And I desperately want to give the hotel a 5 but there are a couple of things that make this resort a 4. One, the traffic noise. There are ear plugs provided but who wants to wear earplugs on their honeymoon. When booking ask for a room in the middle of the resort not on the edge. Now, the Mosquitos. The resort does everything possibly to assuage the onslaught, but unfortunately they are a constant. The spray is provided and if you are sensitive to the old mozzie then be vigilant. But the good stuff, the good stuff is sensational. Breakfast is amazing, the warm muffins are delicious, and the coffee is strong. The private, one bedroom villa was sensational. It was luxury. The outside showers with the squirrels playing in the trees was a treat. The gazebo beds, the pool, every detail taken care of. I loved it and even with the mozzies, I'd go back.\n", "\nOnly 3 nights with this private pool + jacuzzi villas is not enough... Trust me! ", "All the interiors are contemporary, stylish and mixing with Balinese design... outdoor shower is fantastic, living room is so relaxing with good amenities, bath salt and bath foam are beautifully funny (with jacuzzi).... just sooo amazing!", "Love every detail they prepare from indoor & outdoor sandals to pair of sun hats, from shopping bags to mosquito repellent, from daily complimentary fruits & mini bar to different balinese snack everyday.... oh my god! I miss there so much already, although I just left yesterday... You can see every staff with big smile all the time, they are super friendly and helpful! ", "This is my biggest reason that I will come back to Bali again!! For sure!!\n", "\nSpent 4 days 3 nights at the two-bedrooms villas with flat pool. I like everything of this resort! They take care of almost everything you could think of, the mosquito repellent, hats for the couple, sandals, essential oils, TV in the bath tub, special shower area outside, daily replenish complimentary fruits & mini bar and etc.. We left by thinking when can we come back again.\n", "\nDecadent, relaxed, stylish, amazing! Say no more this place ticks all the boxes - we had a romantic getaway for 6 days and didn't want to leave!!", "Thanks My Bali for organising this holiday - Tom was great to deal with and gave us a great package including the $500 wine dine credit - which came in handy for some spa sessions and a fancy dinner. I'd recommend this hotel and My Bali to anyone - cheers\n", "\nWe were looking for a peaceful getaway and Amarterra surpassed all our expectations. The whole experience right from its inception at the reception to the end was simply amazing and revitalizing. Amarterra Villa is very conveniently located in the Nusa Dua resort area and the beach area.", "We spent 2 days at the villa and it already felt like a home. The villa itself is a marvel. It is framed like a luxury house in the nature and it is very well decorated fixed with superior quality amenities, nothing is missing. As soon as you enter into the villa, you discover a nice pool and open air living room just by it. There is a lot of space to walk around, a lot of places where you can relax or enjoy a drink that makes the overall experience of stay at the villa very relaxing.", "We especially enjoyed the shower that is outside in the nature, very convenient when you come back from the beach, as well as the bath with the Jacuzzi. ", "The staff is very well cultured and caters to all of your specific needs with urgency. For example, we wanted to play squash and in 10 min they arrange a booking and even the transportation. It is very comforting to see smiling faces all around and greeting you very well when you meet them. The staff is very hospitable, extremely friendly and helpful. Other than the superb service that they bestowed on us, they complement your experience with speaking others languages, such as French. ", "We had the real pleasure of tasting the amazing food served at our villa as a gastronomic diner. You can also customize your breakfast in various ways and preferences. This gives you a very good start to your day. Everything is fresh, scrumptious and very timely organized.

Thanks for everything we will come back for sure.\n", "\nVery well designed to give you total privacy with friendly Balinese staff. Each villa is huge and has its own private lap pool. The complex also has a main pool area. Beach with clean white sand and sun beds is only a short walk away. My partner and I loved our eight days. Staff were really helpful. Spacious bedroom (great bed) and bathroom with private outdoor shower. We used the small gym and the Spa services. Breakfasts were served in our villa. Mosquitos are around but using the coils outside effectively minimises bites and no problem inside the villa at all. Beautiful gardens and water features away from the hustle and bustle. Easy walk to a restaurant strip nearby. While food in the main restaurant was very well presented, we thought it was a bit expensive and for some reason the service was very slow. We will definitely go back. Being in Nusa Dua, it is quieter and less hectic than other parts of Bali, but that was what we were after this trip.\n", "\nAfter reading many reviews we decided to stay at Amarterra, what a beautiful property.", "The gardens and surrounds are just beautiful, a credit to the team of gardeners.", "We could not fault any of the staff, all were very respectful and willing to help and give advise when needed.", "The villas were just so peaceful and relaxing, a perfect way to wind down and destress from a very stressful life back here in Australia.This resort appears to be much more suited to adults and honeymooners,", "I would definitely go back to Amarterra.", "I would like to add that they choose more high end products in the spa for facials current product on offer does not give good results and price is high for the product used.", " Room service and food in general at the resort is very good, we had a couple of room service meals and found them to be more than adequate, service was very quick despite the fact all villas were full. Very well done to the staff concerned.", "We hope to return later in the year work permitting.", "Once again many thanks to all the hard working and dedicated team at Amarterra.", "Kathy & Peter Western Australia\n", "\nStayed for 8 nights in a one bedroom villa at Amarterra, and the experience has exceeded my expectation. The grounds around the Villa is landscaped beautifully. The entire complex is next to a main street but the grounds inside the Villa makes you think that you are away it all. The layout is very well thoughtout and fabulous. The villa is very private also, it has your own dining and living area outside of the bedroom. It even has your own lap pool. The shower is 'outdoor' but no-one can look in. The whole thing is very clearly designed, and I am really impressed. Attentive staff also contribute to my great experience. Also a free mini bar was a great plus. In terms of location, it was walking distance to the beach and if walking is not your thing, you can grab a buggy at reception and let it take you there. Eating out is no problem, again it is walking distance to the restaurant strip with lots of restaurants to choose from. ", "The only gripe I have is the in-house restaurant - two nights we dined in the only Amaterra restaurant, and our meal took nearly two hours. In terms of breakfast, only a la cart breakfast menu is on offer. One morning we decided to have breakfast in the restaurant, and after 45 minutes, we have to leave without brekkie because our pre-arranged tour guide picking us up. I think many people had similar experience had decided to order room service - at least you can wait for your meal in the comfort of your air-conditioned bedroom at the ordered time. Another observation I have is that the breakfast order is rarely correct. If I ordered two juice, only 1 would be on a tray, or staff forgot the butter etc however, given the attentiveness of staff, it wasn't a big deal. However, I think a buffet breakfast would fix all this.", "Overall, we wanted a holiday to relax and not do much, and Amaterra Villa was perfect for that.\n", "\nMe and my friend stayed 3 days in Amarterra and if I had to sum it in one word I would just say PARADISE.", "Everything was perfect from the moment we passed the gate and discovered the immense entry of the hotel until the check-out. I had seen pictures of the main gate on the internet before going there but I was far from imagining that the place was so impresive in the reality..!! The lobby and the entrance are really huge, the staff at front office is really professional and so lovely.. They do everything to make your stay incredible and they are always available, you feel like you are never disturbing them even if you call during the night they seem always happy and available to assist you ! ", "We were staying in a one-bedroom villa and the place is really exclusive, you have 3 TVs in the villa (also one in the bathroom to watch it while taking your jacuzzi !), the mini-bar is free of charge and refilled every day, there is a coffee machine, tea, fruits, sweets, cakes or other specialities from bali (a different one every day!). the bed and the pillows are so comfortable, the pool is big and had the perfect temperature. The villa was so comfortable that we wanted to stay there the all day long instead of visiting the island!", "The beach club is very close to the hotel (5min by walk) and is private for the hotel guests, so it was quiet and clean! perfect if you want to rest and enjoy the beach peacefully!!", "The restaurant is beautiful and has an very nice view on the main pool ! The breakfast was really nice with the choice between different main courses (both indonesian and western style) you can order it in your villa but we prefered to go to the restaurant in the morning. We went out for lunch and diner - bali collection has lot of different choices and is very near the hotel.. we tried the cocktails at the bar and it is worth it.. you should definitly try the signature cocktail.. was delicious !", "To me, what is making this hotel very special and more valuable than others is the staff ! you feel like they are always available for you and seem so happy to help you or to see you!! You will feel unique and privileged with all the staff smiling at you and giving you so many positive feelings !! In this hotel, the staff is making you feel like at home.. You feel like you're just at the right place! ", "I will recommand this place without hesitation for people searching for a quiet place to rest and relax in a luxurious hotel. Was a wonderful holiday there hope I will come back :)) thank you to all the team for making our stay so great!\n", "\nAn honest review", "The photos of the Villa and the resort are exactly like it is - something that you often don't find when arriving at your destination. Beautiful to look at but fell short in delivery.", "Our villa was a one bedroom. Very quiet, didn't hear neighbours or construction work and the resort was full due to Easter holidays. Having said that we hardly ever saw anyone. Both showers really are outdoors, but the advertised \"outdoor\" one can only be accessed by walking through the villa and the villa shower - bit odd??? Housekeeping was a bit hit and miss and had to chase up a couple of times for bath towels and water etc. Mini bar was complimentary and re-stocked every day. Only complaint was that there were 2 cokes (full fat). I asked reception if they could be changed to Diet coke but that wasn't possible. Told that if I wanted Diet coke I would have to buy from the bar. Couldn't really understand the logic in this.", "The restaurant was empty - probably due to high prices. Nothing for a vegetarian in the evening.", "Had lunch by the pool - no-one in restaurant or by the pool at the time. Ordered a Bintang and Foccacia vegetaian sandwich with French fries. The bar didn't have any bin tang that day or Foccacia bread and I got wedges not fries - took half an hour to arrive. At breakfast they had run out of croissants.", "Mosquitos everywhere although cant lay that at the hotels door. You have to worry when there is insect repellent on every table in the restaurant! Unfortunately it was so bad that we couldn't use the outside of our villa at all which is a shame as it's so lovely.", "Beach club - needs more umbrellas. They only have 4 and there are a few under a tree but if they are taken you are out in the full sun.", "Our door key often didn't work and housekeeping , who were always nearby, had to get their master key.", "Was there to really relax but something was a bit off every day.", "Let's look at the positives :- Rai at reception is wonderful. Nothing too much trouble, remembered our names, always happy. Dewi at the Beach club is great. Always happy to help and translate with the massage ladies. Looked after us well.", "Golf cart - available to take you to the Beach club or to the Bali Collections (restaurants and shops). Both 5 minutes away and we walked most of the time but there if you want it and never a long wait.", "Villa as good as it looks in the photos.", "So disappointed, was really looking forward to its 5 star billing but need to work on lifting their standards to be as lovely as those photos.\n", "\nWe booked a 2 bedroom villa as friends travelling . The rooms are large with all amenities. Free WIFI, Mosquito zapper for room etc.. coils are needed to the outdoor lounging area tho. We burned ours all day long to be sure. Coffee perc, non alcohilic bar free, nibbles free, Fruits every day with Cookies and sweet treat each evening in case you are peckish. Call for a Golf Buggy that will take you short trip to beach club. Beach is clean and qite nice . It's over all a guiet resort with most enjoying their privacy in own pools so usually able to get a Li-low at the common pool. Breakfast is typical M Gallery style. (try the Eggs Bendict Amarterra style with Lobster sauce...to die for), but i suggest those with children try a bigger resort as this one is maybe not exciting enough for kids. Close to Bali Collection Shopping Centre. Spa was reasonably priced and a true spa rather tha beauty salon. I would add mani/Pedi for guests.\n", "\nIt was amazing.

We were there for 6 days on 2 bedroom and then changed to 1 bedroom villa. The experience was amazing. From the moment we arrived at the lobby, we were blown away by the decoration as well as the service. Cold towels, and ginger tea was offered. The staff were very kind and attentive to our needs. The villa has a lot of trees, which really compliments the humidity and the hot weather. ", "You can ask for buggy and drive you to the private beach area which is about 5 mins. You will meet friendly hotel staff named Dewa, who will do his best to ensure that your stay in the private beach is well looked after. ", "Thank you Amarterra for such an amazing experience. It was too short, and it was hard for us to say good bye.\n", "\nWe had little knowledge of what to expect and then arriving at the lobby entrance, immediately blown away. It was if you were entering a different world...so peaceful. The short walk down the line of villlas, accompanied by a winding stream, to our villa was magical. Such an array of plants and all with their native name attached. It then opened up to the restaurant/bar overlooking a huge pool. Then on to our pool villa that was so private. The quality of the rooms is first class and we were overwhelmed by the friendly staff. This is a place to chill and to take in the beauty of the surroundings. We had the pleasure of sharing lunch on one occasion with Pascal, the GM, that was absolutely divine. And the beach is just 100m away. Amarterra has everything to offer the discerning traveler and we'll be back.\n", "\nwe were there for 3 nights. the hotel campus is beautiful with fruit trees and ready to pluck and eat fruits. the staff is very courteous and helpful and polite. the villa is beautiful with the pool and lounge area. we were in the irish villa which had beautiful firangi paani trees and flowers strewn on the deck and in the pool every morning. the interiors are also plush with the awesome jaccuzzi and a walk in closet and open air bathroom...!!! breakfast in bed was amazing.", "the buggy drive to the beach to the catch the beautiful sunrise from the east coast is much recommended.", "and a tandem cycle ride around the beautifully landscaped and well manicured lawns of nusa dua is a must do for all couples...!!!", "the only hitch at amarterra were the mosquitos inspite of all the effort by the staff in form of coils and repellant sprays. beware of them and keep the door the villas closed. i guess its seasonal...\n", "\nTogether with my wife I spent 7 days in February in this fantastic resort.", "The staff is more than friendly, the location is great and the services are of high quality.", "The front office manager, Mr. Sabar Sitompul was extremely friendly and helped us to have a great stay.", "We recommend this resort to all who want high quality services and an outstanding holiday.", "Beatrice and Gabriel from Romania\n", "\nA humble and warm welcome from all the staff.

The staff are welcoming and check in is done promptly and without fuss. A concierge takes you in a buggy to your villa along with your luggage and once you arrive, they take you through the amenities the villa has to offer which is extremely helpful when you're staying somewhere new as you don't have to wonder where everything is kept or how things work. This is a 5 minute process and totally worth it. More places should do this!", "We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa and it was gorgeous. The bed was comfortable with pillows like clouds and there was a large walk in robe and massive bathroom. The big bathtub has a tv above it which was great for a relaxing bubble bath on our last night.

And if you run low, they will happily and quickly bring you more. In fact every time we called reception or house keeping for something, we found their service to be lightning fast and always with a smile.", "The daily turn down service is so discreet - we never ever had a knock at our door from housekeeping. They only ever made up the room while we were out which was at different times each day. It was like they knew! Very observant :)", "People complaining of mosquitoes make me laugh. First of all, this is the tropics. Secondly, the hotel provides an electronic mosquito zapper, mozzie coils, spray and a mosquito net for your bed (which we never needed to use because we kept our door closed at all times when we came in or out). We didn't get bitten once. Complaining about mosquitoes is like complaining about the weather - the hotel has no control over it!", "The outdoor private pool was absolute heaven. They provide pool towels each day and there was nothing better than waking up and jumping in the pool to battle the humidity! It's not fenced so just be mindful if you have kids. ", "The room service food was great. If you want it really hot then you should dine in the restaurant but we didn't mind as we still found it to be fresh by the time it reached our villa. We had breaky delivered every morning which was extensive and we had the nasi goreng a few times which was so yummy! ", "Please try to tip the staff here! It makes a big difference to their life and although $5 doesn't seem like much to us, it is to them. If they're doing a great job, a tip is worthwhile.

The staff are very attentive without being overbearing and they respond to your request or inquiry very fast. They remembered our names, greeted us, asking how we were doing, and always smiley. One particular thing to note was one time my friend ordered a glass of mixed juice (1/3 lemon and 2/3 orange) when we were at the public pool. The following morning, during breakfast and without being asked, the waitress at the restaurant delivered a glass of mixed juice of 1/3 lemon and 2/3 orange. How cool is that??

No need to bring your own towel as Amarterra has a special area (manned) only for its guests in the otherwise public beach.", "The location of this villa is also good. If you feel like shopping, there is the Bali Collection or the street vendors just outside Nusa Dua complex. If you feel like fine dining, go to numerous 5 stars resorts around Nusa Dua. The villa does not have its own taxi counter but the front desk staff would be more than happy to call a taxi for you when you need it. ", "Lastly, I would like to offer some of my thoughts on how to make Amarterra an even better place.", "1. Mosquitoes is still quite a problem despite the effort to fumigate the area and providing guests with mosquitoes repellent. Although it is NOT AS BAD as I had expected before coming to this villa, I still think that the annoyance level can be further reduced especially to those who are not used with mosquito bites. One day I am free from the bites, the next day I got mosquito bites all over my arms and legs.", "2. Although it is not Amarterra's fault, the very intrusive noise and excessive heavy vibrations (it felt more like an earthquake actually!) from nearby construction was quite a let down. It would be nice to get a heads-up or a notice from the staff during check-in that there might be noise etc.", "3. Just a minor point, i think breakfast offering could be improve, both in terms of taste and variety. ", "All in all, this small property shines among other big resorts in Nusa Dua. Attentive staff, beautiful villa, wonderful landscape, and nice beach are the highlights of my trip. Would I come back and stay longer? Absolutely! ", "Special thanks to the front desk staff (Sabar, Alfil, and David) and the staff who drove me to the hospital (forgot to ask his name) when I got food poisoning\n", "\nA truly magnificent stay. The Villas are exceptional and quite stunning to say the least. Loved the outside sitting room, each Villa has its own pool which is a beautiful touch. Bedroom ample size (nice touch to have the mosquito net around the bed), beautiful walk in wardrobe, huge bathroom with a beautiful outside shower area (x2). There is a free complementary bar of non-alcoholic food and beverages which is refilled every day. Basically, help yourself to sodas, coke, juices, crisps, peanuts, sweets etc. Another beautiful small touch is leaving a little Balinese sweet dish when room service turns down the beds in the evening. These little touches make the stay even better. The beach is very close by and the Villas offer the buggy for transportation if you are feeling too lazy to walk the 7 minutes to the beach. For those who i have read on previous reviews complaining about the mosquitos, really???! This is Bali, it has mosquitos. You can't blame the hotel for nature. We actually encountered just as many mosquitos when travelling around Italy during the summer so it is hardly a \"problem\" of SE Asia. I cannot recommend this place enough for those who want some tranquility in amazing surroundings in 5 star luxury. It is surrounded by larger 5 star resorts which you can easily visit for fine dining, the Bali collection of tourist shops in 5 minutes away and the traditional Bali \"strip\" of restaurants and massage places seconds away. Perfect, thank you Amarterra. Your staff are excellent and your accommodation simply stunning\n", "\nFrom the moment we arrived to the moment we left eight nights later, we were delighted to be guests of Amarterra Villas.", "In the lead up to our stay, I corresponded several times with the Front Office Manager - Sabar - and he was able to answer many inquiries to help us better prepare for our stay.", "Transport was arranged for only IDR 200,000 (AUD $20.00) billed to our room and when we arrived through Arrivals at Denpasar Airport our driver - Gede - made sure to be RIGHT at the front of the other thousands of drivers with a sign with my name clearly printed on it. I am glad not to have had the stress of locating our driver!", "The drive only takes about 30 minutes to get to the hotel and it's great now that they've opened a new freeway over the water. Remember to use this freeway every time you catch a cab to Kuta or Seminyak or wherever as it'll cut down a lot of time spent on the road and is very safe. The toll is only IDR 10,000 (AUD $1.00) so keep some notes handy.", "If you can, I SERIOUSLY recommend arriving after the sun goes down so to make for a more breathe-taking experience. The hotel makes great use of its water features and lighting and to arrive through the main gates with all the lamps lit it is very impressive!", "Check-in is quick with a boutique style reception desk, tall-backed cane chairs and juice served while your documents are processed.", "After this you are escorted to your villa. Entry to the villa is even more exciting in that they will have all the lights lit up, the fountains over the pool running and the bed prepared with a welcome message written in rose petals (see my pics). All the amenities and features of the villa are explained, as well as the process in how to go about ordering your breakfast for the following morning.", "The Outdoor Living Room has a very large LG television and an iPod dock with Bluetooth capabilities, and a matchin outdoor furniture set featuring a large 'barrel chair', two comfortable over-sized chairs, coffee table, boutique dining table and chairs and a towel rack for pool towels. Cutlery and crockery is provided, along with bottle opener and ice bucket.", "Breakfast is amazing with a rotating menu so that you aren't bored of it by Day Eight of your stay. There is a great selection of fruits, yoghurts, juices, coffees, bread basket with croissants and pastries and there are several hot selections you can make too, both Western and Balinese. ", "Minibar is complimentary and is replenished daily. There is no alcohol provided, but it's great to be able to grab a cold drink and small snack anytime you want! The fridge is just big enough to fit three large sized Bintangs alongside the provided minibar items.", "The Pool is of a good length and depth for lap-swimming and if ever the pool starts to get a few too many leaves in is, just call Housekeeping and they'll send someone to remove them anytime. The water isn't too cold (being in a tropical climate of course) and is well-filtered and not too over-chlorinated.", "The Cabana is right next to the pool and has two loungers there but you also have two sun loungers over near the villa for sunbathing. ", "The Gardens are lush and extremely well-maintained. It truly is a paradise! The walls are high enough to provide complete privacy so I do highly recommend this resort if you like to go nude in the pool and on the sundecks.", "King Sized Bed - In the villas itself, the air conditioning is kept at a very comfortable temperature. All fixtures and furniture are stylish, of good quality and in very good condition. The loveseat is very comfy with lots of cushions and the King Sized Bed is lovely and comfortable and features a colourful artwork above it. The bed has a canopy above it that can be prepared with a mosquito net if required. The bed is very comfortable with a nice thick doona (aka 'duvet') and the mattress is incredibly comfortable. There are two pillows provided, one soft and one medium-hard. I slept SO well night after night! The hotel provides two Balinese cakes each day and placed by the bedside, along with a jar of lollies.", "The Walk-in Wardrobe has enough room for two people's clothing and luggage and has a beach bag, two hats, thongs, slippers, bathrobes and kimonos ready to use. There are also two umbrellas for when it rains.", "The Safe is of a good make and easy to use.", "High Speed Broadband is free and is very, very fast with a great connection (I am currently uploading a 20 minute video review of our villa as I type this, and it's processing well!) There is a spacious and comfortable work desk that looks out onto your pool and sundeck.", "The Bathroom features an over-sized jacuzzi-style bath tub with bath salts, bath foam, shower gel and shampoo all provided in cute little black jars. There is also a TV above the bath if you want to watch anything while soaking. The bath is right next to a window that opens onto one of the gardens. There are double vanity sinks and all the amenities provided that you'd expect from a five-star hotel including toothbrushes and free bottled water (Don't forget to use these as tap water is not safe to drink in Indonesia).", "The shower is partially an out-door shower and has three shower nozzles, one that is hand-held and the other two fixed. The water doesn't have a drain to go down but flows off of the tiles and onto some rocks in the garden (where there is then obviously a drain). If you exit the shower by going into the back of the villa there is a SECOND shower to also use, this time with a Rainforest Shower directly above you. ", "My only - ONLY - criticism of the villa is that you cannot access this outdoor rainforest shower from the pool without having to go through the villa. It's a shame they didn't design it with a small side path in mind.", "I also want to comment on the mosquito issue - the hotel acknowledges and has provided for this minor, MINOR, annoyance. They are not sweeping this 'problem' under the rug; they provide mosquito coils, repellant and an insect spray as well as a mosquito net that can be suspended over the canopy of the bed (and the cabana also has curtains that can be pulled to enclose the it too) I think it is absolutely ridiculous that anyone would come to a tropical location in Asia and mark a hotel down because of a pre-existing, natural, and only slightly annoying problem such as mosquitoes. That'd be like coming to Australia and complaining about the flies! They could build an eight-star hotel right next door and they too would have the same exact problem.", "Closing thoughts and handy tips - the hotel is very exclusive, even the taxi drivers don't know of it too well, so please make sure that you get a fair idea of where the Bali Collection shopping centre is and then you can direct your driver to the resort's driveway and main gate. There are only about 50 villas, so this is not a bustling, stressful hotel full of kids and airline crews. In fact, we felt like we were the only guests staying, as it wasn't until day four that we finally saw another guest!!! This is a good thing as it makes for more personalised service.", "Do not join Accor Advantage Plus before coming to Bali, JOIN HERE. Membership in Australia is about AUD $315.00 a year whereas if you join here it is only $230.00 and ALL the benefits are the same - including the dining discounts - BUT you will also get not one, but TWO free award nights!!! (second free night has to be used in Indonesia though) I am so glad we waited and didn't buy the membership before we came!", "Also, if you can get another couple to join you on holidays, reserve a Two Bedroom Villa. Technically, you actually get TWO villas, separated by the pool and living room areas, with their own bathrooms. You'll save yourself quite a bit doing this and not getting your own separate villas. There is also a Three Bedroom Villa here too. ", "Lastly, do a little homework and have a look at how much other hotels nearby sell their One Bedroom Pool Villas for per night. You'll be pleasantly surprised to find that you are saving anywhere from AUD $300 - $500 per night by staying at Amarterra Villas AND you are getting not only the same facilities and service, but even better facilities and service!", "A big thank you to Sabar and his team. We couldn't have been happier with this resort and will definitely be coming back again in the near future!\n", "\nSmall hotel but it really come with the best quality of all. ", "Service : Really quick and very professional. ", "Staff : the staff really helpful and work with a good attitude. They can remember a guest name (even this a bit sound like a Starbucks). In my case that really impressed me that they can remember my name even when I went back there again after checked out for 3days. ", "Even the hotel didn't have a taxi counter but staff always help to provide one. And didn't even try to push me to use hotel taxi at all, not like the other hotel. ", "And actually I had a chance to try hotel taxi service a couple times to tour around the island. The driver was polite and he can suggest an other interesting spots on the way. ", "Breakfast at the restaurant : small restaurant but not crowed. Might because you can choose a breakfast to serve at your villa. But I didn't try a breakfast at the villa because I like the service at restaurant so much ... it was so good so I went down to restaurant everyday :) ", "And I had a chance to try an Indonesian dish and also a pasta for dinner and it was a blast!", "Love the small walk way to the hotel. The gardener made sure they keep it neat and beautiful. As i love gardening...so this hotel garden is one of the best walk-way ever. ", "Location : A bit away from the shopping center or the hotel beach. But that problem have been solved with the hotel free drop off service anywhere in Nusa Dua area. Impressive!\n", "\nI don't usually write reviews but have in this instance as felt to an extent a need to defend this resort. I do understand that people all have certain requirements but some really need to put things into perspective. In this instance I am a bit annoyed at how picky some people can be.", "I stayed for 4 nights 23/1 to 26/1/2014. My partner and I had a wonderful time.", "Sure the resort is quiet but hey it is a small exclusive all villa resort with limited number of villas and therefore guests. If you want somewhere busier, then stay elsewhere. If you want quietness and time to just relax without many guests around then this is the place. Also remember this is to off season!", "I for one loved not having to put up with the noise and inconvenience of having many other tourists around.", "Re the comments about the mosquitoes. Isn't it currently the wet season (i.e. mozzie breeding season) in Bali? Please get real as you will get mosquitoes in most parts of Bali. If you take the many precautions provided free of charge by the resort (spray, coils, etc) then these work very well. The staff even put the coils out for you - maybe some guests are just too lazy to light them or even apply spray to themselves? Most of our time we spent outside in the villa pool or lounging. No problems. if you don't like mosquitoes then maybe visit Bali (or anywhere tropical) in the dry season?", "Noise I don't recall being a problem. Our villa backed onto the construction site. No noise issues encountered from this and none from neighboring villas. Maybe we were lucky? Or maybe we so any background noise did not become an issue. The only \"noise\" we encountered was the great sound of ever flowing water.", "We ate breakfast everyday and also had dinner at the restaurant a couple of the nights. The food (and coffee!!!) was excellent. If you visit make sure you order a G&T to experience the way they serve this.", "One of the main attractions to visiting this resort again, is the staff. From check-in to room services, to the restaurant, housekeeping and yards people. All very polite and discrete and the attention to detail, we could not fault. I am sure their smiles were genuine.", "The access to the beach is down a lane. So what. Not a long walk at all and the small area provided is well maintained and clean. Small and exclusive. Close by is a food/drinks venue if you want something to eat or drink.", "Sure the resort isn't for everybody. However if you want a very quiet resort, limited kids, very discrete and friendly staff then this is the place.\n", "\nAs I sit by the pool in my villa I reflect on the last few days. My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in January 2014. ", "The good: collection from the airport was seamless and it was a quick trip to the hotel over the new bridge/highway. Toll is RP10,000 or roughly AUD$1. Check in was quick and the customary cool towel and welcome drink were spot on. We were shown to our room which I have to say is the best villa I have stayed in yet in Bali. The furnishings are a high quality and the bathroom is exceptional. There are two showers, both outside but still pretty private.", "The pool itself is a good size and at 1.5 metres the depth is spot on. The water was a bit colder than I would prefer but there has been a lot of rain and limited sun.", "The mini bar is complimentary and restocked daily with snacks and soft drinks. Alcohol is available for purchase by calling room service. A nice touch.", "The restaurant has an eclectic assortment on the menu, I would prefer a few simpler options personally. The drinks are quite expensive, we would have gone to the restaurant/bar more if the prices were more reasonable.", "Breakfast is very good and it's good to be able to dine in your villa.", "We stayed on Australia Day and it was a very nice touch to be presented with a bottle of Hatten Rose with a card wishing us a happy Australia Day. ", "The service is impeccable with the staff doing all they can to make the stay pleasant.", "The not so good: the list is very limited but I have to mention the mozzies. Insect repellant and mozzie coils are provided but I am still from head to toe in bites. I don't know what more the hotel can do but it does impact on your ability to relax.", "Location is good, a very short walk to Bali Collection which is good for the essentials. There are restaurants there too but it seems very artificial (doesn't have that Bali vibe). The beach is a short walk away (once you know where you are going) but the beach is not great for swimming. Harsh sand and rough water. No good for snorkling either with zero visibility underwater. There is a deck at the beach club, step on it at your own risk. The boards are rotten and I fell through one, 5 mins later another guy fell through in a different area. The whole thing should be pulled down and replaced.", "Overall it has been a very nice stay. would I come back? Yes, but I would need to bring a lot of insect repellant.\n", "\nHighly recommend Amarterra for those who like Bali. We come to Bali often for my husbands work and usually stay in Seminyak but were on holidays this time and decided to try Nusa Dua for a change. Area is quieter than Seminyak but plenty to do and no shortage of nice restaurants. We went to seminyak for dinner one night and it was 40min (though I am told it can be up to 1h in traffic). Goold restaurants nearby at Sakala (we went there twice), Bubu Bali, Soleil, Edogin", "With regard to the hotel, here is a summary of the features we value in resorts and how Amarterra did so well:", "Rooms: beautiful, we stayed in a 1 bedroom villa with private pool. Very clean. Plenty of sun during the day on the terrace within our villa which is not always the case with villas in Bali. Beds really comfortable (suited both of us and we like both soft and hard beds). We had read reviews that it was a long walk to the villas but we didnt feel like it was too far and enjoyed the privacy.", "Service: beyond expectation, polished staff, all friendly, even the maintenance and landscaping people, breakfast could be ordered to the villa for no extra charge. Front desk staff were lovely ", "Food: Enjoyed a la carte breakfast as a change from buffets we usually have at hotels. Presentation was excellent and service prompt, food fresh. We also tried the dinner menu on our first night and enjoyed what we ordered. My husband thought the menu could have more variety. Nice traditional balinese treat/sweet every night with turn down service. Complimentary mini bar refilled every day. (And wasn't just a token minibar with two items like many places)", "Wifi: very fast (my husband relies on good internet connection for his business) There was one instance when the internet wasn't working and IT support came immediately to rectify the problem.", "Gym: Elliptical and treadmill as well as good weights station with some free weights. Air conditioned room. Always clean. Towels and water provided.", "Would definitely stay here again.\n", "\nWe spent 11 nights at the Amarterra villas. The property is beautifully manicured and gives the illusion of seclusion. However, upon arrival we had to request a different villa due to the excessive road noise amplified by the villas design. The new villa was equally as beautiful and located on the west border. This villa too had issues as it is bordering a new mega resort that is in the initial phase of construction. The construction noise was tolerable but neither issue was addressed by the staff prior to our checking in. ", "Two major issues exist which would keep us from staying at the resort again: One, the Mosquitos are intolerable. Due to the decking that is installed in every villa and around the resort Mosquitos have a perfect breeding ground and when the property is fumigated they never treat under the decks. Two, the food at the restaurant in just not good. The menu is very limited and the food quality just isn't up to par. The staff is very friendly but that is not enough to keep you there. Every night we left to other resorts and restaurants for food and drinks. Each night we were there the restaurant looked like a ghost town. ", "Amarterra was a nice place but because of the Mosquitos, food, and long walk to the beach I would choose someplace else next time.\n", "\nWe arrived here as the main part of our honeymoon. From arriving at the front reception the scenery and attention to detail is spectacular, 2 infinity pools with a pathway through the middle with exquisite lighting leading to a grand entrance into the collection.

You are provided with body sprays, room sprays, electric plug ins and burning coils + they spray the resort twice a week but it doesn't stop all of them. My wife reacts badly to being bitten so this was a big deal for us, she must have over 50 bites in our 5 days here so far.", "Secondly (through no fault of their own) there is another resort being built nearby and the noise is noticeable. Also you have to walk past the building site on the way to the beach which is a little unsightly. ", "Thirdly the food. Whilst breakfast is good, lunch and dinner is average at best and overpriced.

A plus point would be on the occasion that me and my wife decided to go out for dinner at a nearby eatery. The reception offered to send and fetch us back after we are done with our dinner. That is truly amazing service. An additional plus point is that they helped to deliver to us our jackets that we left in our villa during check-out.

Individual villas with their own courtyard/pool, entertainment area and sun loungers. Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks in the mini-bar are re-stocked free of charge daily.The big problem and I have several decades of residence in Asia so can reasonably comment on it, is that the mosquitos swarm very badly indeed there just about all day long, such that unless your covered in repellent from head to toe and from morning until night, you will find it a real challenge to enjoy the outside area of your villa. Friends in another villa had exactly the same problem. I was bitten checking in, bitten whilst receiving the \"in-villa welcome ceremony\" and bitten whilst having a leg massage in the spa. In the end, it was easier to stay in the room though that had it's fair share of mozzies also. We had one meal in the restaurant - beef rendang which was a pretty average, small portion and we ate out the rest of the stay. ", "It's well placed for the Bali Collection and hotel staff will take you to the nearby beach at the rear of the resort in a golf buggy. There was some noise from a nearby road but it was tolerable and ear plugs were provided. Villas are well designed and equipped. Staff are extremely accommodating and if it weren't for the mosquito problem being as big as it is, I would rate it more highly and would likely go back.\n", "\nWe have a short holiday, returning to Bali, after 4 year. It is a low season but we wish to get away from Bangkok for a quiet and relaxing time. And quiet and relaxing are what we indeed got in Bali this trip, apart from being recharged.", "Bali has changed a bit comparing to our last visit. The airport looks better- think it is getting better than Jakarta. Also that they have this Jalan Toll from the airport direct to \"Amarterra - M Gallery, where we have spent such a lovely time. We have been to bali more than 10 times and we would mostly stay at villas rather than hotels. Our choice is this new M Gallery from ACCOR. We like the concept of this ACCOR brand - being boutique and design.", "The hotel is located in Nusa Dua which is more or less a gate community which has so to say better security that other beach. Though it is quite far if we want a busy and buzzling night life, it is so perfect for a tranquil holiday.", "The set up of the hotel is so charming and green. Usually, we are not very keen the setting and too design landscape, but this hotel has given us a different effect. We feel relax right after passing through the gate. Actually, I forget the mention that the driver was so polite and the pick up car was not too smelly with those overly scented spray.", "we were guided to our villa which has private pool. Every villa has private pull, and I believe they less than 40 villas (and no other room type). We asked the staff to see the 3 bedroom villa. OMG, we promise ourselves next time when we have a group of friends, we would definitely stay here. The design of the hotel is not so ethnicy, yet still remain the air of Bali - open living space.", "The hotel doesn't have a direct access to the beach. You need to walk quite a bit to the beach. However, we hardly go the the beach in Bali since Thailand has the better one. Besides, if you have such a private pool in your own villa, or even the common pool in front of the fitness, you don't actually need to get bothered by all i-bu(s) asking if you need pedicure on the beach.", "What made the experience memorable for this hotel is the service. We are spoiled when we live in Asia, and sometimes we get over attention. What I like it here is that the service is quiet attentive - meaning you don't physically see them, but they are there. If you start to look for something on the dining table, e.g., pepper, they just simply appear from no where and offer help. You can have your own breakfast without the feeling of being watched all the time.", "For us, this is one of the best hotels we have ever been to Bali. The only thing that I'm a bit concern is that it is far from the action/shopping. However, if you look for an upscale, charming, relaxing, 5-star services, and private get-away. This would be \"the\" place.\n", "\nFrom the moment you drive up, through private gates, and are greeted this place is breathtaking. The service is flawless. Upon entering your villa, I dare you not to say 'wow'. The outdoor space is completely private. The pool is not merely a lap pool but probably half as big as a regular backyard pool. The outdoor pavilion is comfortable and perfectly equipped. And that's before you even enter the villa itself, which is amazingly luxurious and spacious. The bathrooms are spacious, and there's an outdoor shower. When you want to go to the beach, which is only a few hundred metres away, you can ask to be taken in a golf buggy, which will collect you from your villa. The bar and restaurant is lovely - very peaceful, quiet and very elegant. The food is lovely, but we would have liked to see more Indonesian options on the menu, which is fairly limited. This would be especially welcome given the resort is about an hour's drive from Seminyak, which has the highest concentration of good restaurants. The Nusa Dua shopping centre has lots of eateries, but none are very good. So the only real limitation of the Amarterra is it's remoteness from good restaurants. Otherwise, it's practically flawless.\n", "\nNo hotel has ever impressed us so intensely as this one upon our arrival: monumental entrance with modern architectural theme but with respect for the local culture and in line with the natural context. The villa itself offers all imaginable amenities, from open-air living space to private pool, jacuzzi and open-air showers etc. The restaurant offers delicious food; As we were almost alone, we received all possible attention from the staff.", "Of course, this hotel comes with a price: not cheap, but not exagerated either. On the downside two aspects the hotel is probably unable to overcome: mosquitoes (they offer all possible repellents) and the noise from the street (noisy scooters all night long).\n", "\nThis was our first time to the Amarterra Villas in Nusa Dua but not our first time to Nusa Dua. The villas are absolutely stunning. The outdoor area is stunning with a flat screen TV and multiple lounges and sunbeds outside. The pool was fabulous and clean. The only issue outside is the mosquitos, because of the lush greenery and still waters surrounding the villa, it attracts the mosquitos. You are provided with mozzie coils and we had lots of them lit at once. The villa's are very private..", "The villa interior is fantastic with a large king size bed and a magnificent bathroom with a spa (and flat screen TV again !)...", "The beachside area allocated to Amerterra Villas is directly next to the public section of the Nusa Dua beach which at times can be trashy. You are allocated your own bed and towel but there is no drink service (which most other hotels along the beach do provide this). The walk down the lane to the beach is only short as the villas are not beachfront.", "The villa public pool was lovely and clean and the breakfast and service was great. We would definately head back to the villas.

Amazing villa, decor, garden pool and grounds. Fantastic service facilities and attention to detail. Complimentary snacks, sweets, mini bar, toiletries, robes, slippers, everything!

Juice at breakfast one day, re stock of the mini bar another day, breakfast ordering card another day, and the toiletries weren't replaced enough but it really didn't matter and as soon as we asked for anything we quickly received. The 2 men who looked after the beach chairs were lovely and kind and so wonderful with our 9 month old son. Great villa for a family with a baby, cot and high chair provided and the bedroom and living areas are separate so you are far enough away to enjoy a movie or a meal or a swim without disturbing a sleeping bub but close enough to still be able to see them through the window. You can get room service, the breakfast was amazing, but the lunch and dinner options were very expensive and not of the quality you would expect for the price.

The choice of breakfast items is quite limited and after a week you wish there was more to choose from.

Keep it up.\n", "\nSpent 5 glorious nights here recently for our second honeymoon, we werent disappointed. Place is very clean and well appointed. Decor is fantastic ( though wasnt comfortable with the outside shower, but we got used to it). All staff were very friendly. We had such a great time with so much privacy to ourselves. We loved the private swimming pool and 4 poster daybed. Breakfast was sufficient. Bali Connection is a 5 min walk where we had most of our dinners. Beach is only a 300 metres walk from our villa. Only one disappointment, we were charged for phone calls that we actually didnt make.\n", "\nWe stayed in Amarterra for eight days. The one bedroom villa had a fantastic interior design. The pool was clean although there was some dust in the morning due to the adjacent construction site. Although the site was very close noise was barely noticeable. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The room was very clean. We took breakfast in the room. Breakfast was a la carte and not a buffet which I consider to be a plus as there are more chances that they offer more fresh products. Wifi was good but we had to retype our password every time we turned the laptop on and off th. That was a bit annoying. We could do with some more lighting in the bedroom area (dimmable). The only real minus was the restaurant menu which was very limited and poor. There is a lot of work to be done there. Landscape was fantastic and very relaxing and tranquil. Main swimming pool area and entrance/reception was of a true five star level. The staff were very helpful with average english, however some of them ( particularly a guy in the morning) were trying to sell us tours and private drivers at a much higher rate that the usual which I consider unacceptable from a hotel of that standard.

You get breakfast, ok not fantastic but very good, free WiFi..I know many may think, big deal, you get two amazing pools..clean with manicured gardens surrounding it. Friendly service.the room, quite big and adequate and clean. Airport transfers, free transport to Bali collection and beach. Yes it's not the flashy hotels on the beach but it's not bad at all. The big downside is it's location but if you just want to chill by the pools relaxing, there's nothing wrong with this place at all.\n", "\nFrom the moment we were picked up at the airport by the hotel staff, I knew we'd be in good hands. The staff at the Swiss Belhotel Segara are absolutely what makes this resort so good. Everyone is incredibly friendly, professional and efficient.

And trust me, it is without any ulterior motive unlike some other areas who try to up-sell you things.", "The resort is a little further out from the strip of resorts in Nusa Dua, which is fantastic if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle. There is a free shuttle bus service to Geger Beach and the Bali Collection shops every hour, but the resort also offers private driver and taxi services if you want to go elsewhere. If you do decide to go with a metered taxi around the Nusa Dua area, the minimum fee is 30,000 rupiah. The pool and gardens are immaculately maintained, as was our room. The bed is super comfy and I really appreciated the fact that the airconditioning was able to be controlled by us, as we quickly acclimatised to the heat and didn't require it to be so cold after a few days. The free wifi was an excellent speed considering how terrible most wifi is at many hotels I've stayed at.", "Thanks for a great stay in Bali!\n", "\nMy second stay with the team at Swiss bel hotel segara. I have had two different style vacations here the first adults only relaxing stay, the second a whole family trip including adults, couples, and my elderly Grandfather and my two cousins aged 2 & 9 respectively.

The free shuttle to the beach is great. I Would highly recommend the Swiss bel hotel segara to anyone wanting to stay in the nicer part of Bali.\n", "\nNice place, clean and good service, great breakfast. Renting bike is a must as it is secluded, need bike to move around. Great staff. Nusa dua is a nice place to be. This hotel is a good option, beach side hotels, resorts are better option though in nusa dua.\n", "\nThe main draw for this hotel is its pool, I must say it is absolutely fabulous, it must have cost as much to build as the hotel did ! Anyway, here we go. Check in was excellent, no problems at all, we were given a premier pool view room as requested and were shown to our room, as it was about 10.30pm we went straight to bed already noticing the damp smell. We woke in the morning and found the smell very strong, we requested a move and once a staff member had verified that the room did indeed have a strong damp smell we were moved to a room two doors along that was fine, so no problems there. Room contained all usual items, 35 or so channels on TV, small fridge, telephone etc. We had the twin beds as we had our 3 year old with us, the beds were brilliant, more like doubles than king singles, plenty of room (unlike Swiss Belhotel Watu Jimbar in Sanur). Beds were comfortable and bedding was excellent quality. We slept like babies every night. Bathroom had a HUGE bath and shower in the bath. Water pressure in the bath was VERY slow, but oddly enough was good in the shower??? Water was beautiful and hot. Usual bathroom amenities. Overall room was a good size and the balcony was perfect, with a great view of the pool, two very comfortable chairs and a table. Downsides to the room: Wifi was terrible, would drop out after 3 minutes requiring complete re-login, even on my new Ipad Air2 with super duper Wifi. Even after moving room there was a slight smell of damp, but ONLY when we put the air con on. The bathroom was a bit shabby, cracks, stains, the trim fell off the glass sliding door on the bath. But other than that, all good. The buffet breakfast was average. don't get me wrong, the quality was good, but variety limited compared to other resorts. It may have been because the hotel was very quiet and they didn't want to waste food, but for example, 3 types of cereal, cordial juices, fried rice and noodles EVERY day, a good egg station making omelets etc, watermelon/pawpaw and rockmelon EVERY day, chicken sausages, beef bacon (to order) and a few danishes that were very dry. Adequate but not very inspiring. We ate in the restaurant one night, hmmm, one night was enough ! When we went it was VERY quiet, (April 20th-23rd) We literally had the pool(s) to ourselves for most of one day. The pools are fabulous, really clean, absolutely HUGE and good for kids. The pool at the back is one depth (about 1.4m) and the one at the front with the waterfall has a large area that is about 0.5m deep, perfect for kids, all surrounded by beautiful gardens and plants. The hotel is away from everything, you cant walk anywhere (unless you want an hour walk). They provide a shuttle to the Bali Collection shopping centre (drop off/pick up) which as lots of EXPENSIVE shops and reasonably priced restaurants, and another shuttle to Geger beach which is one of the best beaches on Bali, it has beautiful clean sand and clear water, I snorkelled out to about 100M and saw lots of fish like puffers, trumpets, wrase and a couple of Nemos (clowns). There are a few cafes there but look a bit grotty.", "Overall it was a nice hotel, average food, great pool, great beds, nice rooms, very quiet, you can buy cans of local beer in the hotel shop for about $2 each, the room service menu looked good, but we didn't use it. Would I go again? Probably not. Would I recommend it? If you want a quiet getaway with a great pool, yes. If you want to be near the town and beach, No.\n", "\nI stayed there for 5days amd it was great!good staff, good service ,good view,fantasti breakfast ,big and schick rooms.Unfortunately despite of having fabulous conditions it has tow problems first in some rooms it has aunts and second its location .In fact most of hotels in Nusa Dua are not located in crowded place .it has beutiful garden with beutiful pools.", "In compare with its price its really recommended specially if your are interested in quite place for relaxing.\n", "\nI stayed at the Swiss-Belhotel Segara for 29 days with family members coming and going in between, covering the end of March and most of April 2015. I had read some of the reviews and cannot understand how some people gave the hotel a bad review. I found it to have very clean rooms which are very comfortable. House keeping refresh the rooms daily and replace towels etc. as well as tidying the room for you. The Laguna Restaurant has good food with a reasonably varied menu from which we never had a bad meal. Breakfast choice is good with cereal, freshly made omelette, noodles, rice, pancakes, fresh fruit and so on plus and endless supply of tea and coffee. You also order a cappuccino for around AUD $4.00. The pools are cleaned daily, there are poolside towels available plus a poolside bar with a food menu too. The hotel boasts a Spa where a good massage costs around AUD $25.00, not as cheap as the beach massage but it's clean and comfortable and the staff treat you very well. The only reservation we had was the location because everything you do requires a taxi, however once we were a bit more experienced we used the free transport that most local restaurants provide which pick you up and drop you off back at the hotel free of charge but you do have to eat at their restaurant. The free bus to and from the Bali Collection runs every hour and the hotel runs a free shuttle bus to and from Geger Beach which is about 5 minutes away. The beach is clean and protected by a reef, there are plenty of beachside cafes available and a sunbed will cost you AUD $2.50 per day. Get a Blue Taxi if the busses don't suit, they have meters and are cheaper than haggling with non-metered taxi's. All in all we can't fault this hotel. I would definitely recommend it to anybody who is looking for a cheaper alternative to a hotel that is located on the beach.\n", "\nFirst, positive things about this hotel. It's on the hill, so away from the noisy road. The staff is friendly. They make very good cappuccino. The shop next door is recommended, it's managed by a kind and helpful couple. ", "Unfortunately, there are quite a few negative things about this particular hotel. It's infested with ants who appear from nowhere within seconds if you leave some food unattented. The cleaning of rooms is poor and the doors let pass noise from the corridor, hence we were woken up early by noisy kids running around. The breakfast has a very poor choice. It targets mostly Asian clients, so noodles and rice are abundant. The croissants and muffins were not edible, bircher muesli had more water than anything in it. The jams tasted strange, so we ended up eating toasts with butter. Then one day they put out the butter that once has melted and has been frozen again, so plain toasts that day. The hotel is far away from the sea, the Geger beach (reached by not so frequent hotel shuttle) is full of stray dogs who pooh around and it's not safe for kids. It's far away from shops, supermarkets and restaurants. Their fitness room is an absolute joke! The machines belong to the dump. ", "The most outrageous thing however is that the hotel staff charged us TWICE for the stay and they didn't inform us about it. So, if my husband didn't check the account, we wouldn't have even found it out! We've even contacted their HQ as the hotel staff were not doing anything to correct the mistake and after numerous emails and threats to write a horrible review on Tripadvisor, they finally acted. Two weeks passed and we are still waiting for our money... ", "This is a four-star hotel but it hardly gets to two-star level. It's not worth the money they charge.\n", "\nStayed for 3 nights and we're really happy. Our room was cool clean smelt great and offered great views, the beds were comfortable and offered the rooms had both WIFI and a good selection of TV stations. Only downside no bath in our room but great large shower. The staff were very friendly and professional. Laguna restaurant was gorgeous, sitting out side gave a real feel of tranquillity. They offered a great selection for breakfast and the main menu the food was decent but not quiet a large enough selection. Restaurant staff very attentive. The pools and grounds are beautiful and clean The free shuttle is a bonus But can get very crowded We have been to Bali many times and wish we had found this place sooner would definitely recommend it. Good value for money\n", "\nFrom outside you can see the beautiful side of the hotel but once you get in... That's the start of counting things that will give answer why this hotel offers cheap price for a premiere room.", "First, the linens has it's distinctive smell that I feel like I don't want to lay down on it. Second, I'm a very particular with the toilet bowls and bathroom. Room 209 toilet bowl has a dark stain as if, it was not clean properly for years and the dirt just marked on the bowl. Third, bath towels has a lot of stains that made me think twice if I should rub it on my wet body specially on my face, good thing I got a chance to get a new towel to replace the old one from the room. Small towels in yellow color was totally disgusting. Fourth, broken trash bin should be thrown away. Fifth, not all electrical outlet were working.", "Cafe laguna, was too warm or I should say hot inside and they only using fan when we had our bfast friday April 10. Staff doesn't even know what's Spanish omelet. And no ham for omelet? Limited choices. There's no consistency in refilling the food station, bfast starts at 7am till 11am and considering the hotel has a lot of guests during breakfast, they should have someone who's responsible in refilling food specially hot food section. ", "\n", "\nMy best friend and I chose to stay at this hotel for its reasonable price compared to the other hotels in Nusa Dua. Sadly to say that for us, the overall experience was mediocre.", "At first glance, the hotel looks really nice with beautiful views of the pool and overlooked the sea from a distance. Once we got into the room though, we were sorely disappointed that everything in it looked old and aged. Although the beds were really comfortable, the pillows and comforter had a funky smell which really put us off. On top of that, the toilet sink had many ants and tap water was salty. One positive part of the stay is that the hotel provides a shuttle bus to and from Geger Beach which we made use of (just a 5 min ride away). ", "While the general staff were nice and helpful, we thought the guys at the hotel's transport counter could have done a better job in advising us on the most cost-efficient way to travel. When we requested for a taxi to Finn's Beach Club, these guys were trying to convince us to pay a negotiated rate and get a driver instead of taking a metered taxi. But we stuck to our gut instinct and went with a metered taxi. We found out later that (for most 30 min rides), taking a metered taxi would save us HALF the cost of paying for a driver.", "Overall, the consensus between my friend and I is that - Next time, we would rather pay a premium for a better quality hotel and a more comfortable experience.\n", "\nI just spent 4 days here with my nieces.

Cheers to them.\n", "\nStayed 2 nights over Nyepi and we had a fantastic stay.", "Stayed in the premiere pool view room with bathtub and spacious balcony overlooking 1 of the 2 big pools.

Plenty of lounge chairs. Shallow area perfect for kids. Nice little gardens inside and outside the pool area. Availability of pool towels poor. ", "Staff were very friendly and helpful despite the busy times. Staff were very accommodating towards our 1 year old. Food was good. We had a package with buffet food, which is as you would expect. Tasty, quality good, enough choice but could be a bit more creative. ", "First night our aircon did not work. I notified front office, the sent the engineer who put the AC back to 16 degrees and told us to wait for it become cold. 3 AM still 28 degrees so we complained, and got moved to another room. ", "WiFi hardly worked, probably due to overload of users during this holiday. ", "4 Stars because staff could have responded a bit more pro-active towards the broken AC and moved us at midnight instead of 3 AM.", "Also availability of pool towels was poor. Although it was busy, I asked 4-5 times over 3 days and never got a pool towel. Staff should be more aware of pool towels taken to guest rooms (?!)", "Overall great stay, would go there again anytime.\n", "\nI stayed at this hotel for four weeks and I would have stayed a lot longer, the place is immaculate and very high service standards.

The free transport to Bali collection and the beach is more than adequate and the quiet serene nature of this resort is heaven compared to most resorts in Bali. There was never a fight for a lounge by the pool, infact you could take your pick.", "The breakfasts and the restaurant setting was perfect and relaxing.", "The fruit smoothies by the pool were to die for and only $2.50 AUS.", "Staff were just lovely and the direct pool access from our room was sensational.", "I was so impressed I am about to book our 2nd stay.", "Dont hestiate if you dont mind being a drive away from the beach.", "Great value staying in although small, lovely surrounds and huge pools way larger than most large resorts.\n", "\nI stayed here for 3 days during business trip.

The staff were friendly and so helpful. The rooms were well and truly adequate and clean. We loved the breakfast buffet, with loads of choices.

We ate at the hotel restaurant for 4x nights rather than in Nusa Dua itself and there is a reasonable choice of menu options.", "We took advantage of looking around the local area outside the hotel.

We enjoyed a few massages in the hotel spa, and would thoroughly recommend these to other visitors.\n", "\nI just had to write to personally thank Mr Lukman R. Basuki for assisting us after we had checked out of the hotel and flew out of the country.

The cash could have easily been found and taken but we were delighted to find out how honest and responsible both the management and room service staff were in finding the cash and wiring it back to us via western union.

I kept calm and say no all I want is the room I've book! Anyway. We had our room.. God.. What's that smell?? They have a serious problem in their bathroom.. I'm not too difficult usually, but this was the worst hotel I've been in Bali!

Downstairs had a very large pull out lounge for the boys to sleep on airconditioning that was great and a separate combined toilet and shower room. I must comment on the toilet it was a wall mounted floor model toilet probably doesn't mean much to most of you but in simple terms the toilet position was way to high. My wife is about five foot high and so is my eldest son and my youngest son a little shorter; well they sat on the toilet and their feet didn't reach the ground; I'm 6 foot one and I found the toilet to high and uncomfortable to use.Generally speaking the stay was pleasant. Would I happily stay there again the answer is yes if I couldn't find anything better available.\n", "\nThis hotel is outstanding. The staff are well trained and extremely helpful. The breakfast choices are amazing! Love the fact that you can sit inside or outside while you eat. The rooms are spotless and the service from the staff are outstanding. Love, love, love the pool set up. Excellent for families with young children. Room service is affordable and the food is delicious!", "Will definately be back!!!", "Is located in a quiet part of Nusa Dua but everything is accessible by taxi.

I'm surprised the hotel didn't put mainland tourists in a separate wing/floor just like many hotels does nowadays.", "Price of this hotel during off-season is extremely affordable, given the size of the room. The hotel is okay clean (just okay, but i spend most of my holidays in Japan so i'm spoiled). Wifi is annoying since it keep asking you for password after you phone went to sleep for a while and get really slow sometimes. The shower is weird, the water power went strong for like 10seconds, and then getting really weak for 10seconds, then it went strong again, weird water pumps. The \"foldable\" slipper it provides was annoying as well, it kept on unfolding itself making it not really wearable. Other than these small hiccups, the hotel generally is a nice hotels with nice staff.", "However, this hotel located in absolute middle of nowhere. There is a small shop in front of the hotel, and then nothing else. Absolutely nothing else within walkable distance, you have to either get a cab or take the shuttle bus to the shopping mall/beach for any food. there are other hotels with similar price which is slightly closer to shops.", "i was struggling between giving a 3(average) or 4(very good) to this hotel but end up giving this hotel a 3. I will give a hotel a 4 if I will come back but I don't think i will come back to this hotel. It has nothing to do with their service or staff, service and staff are good. It's just the location really sucks. there are hotels at better location at the same price.\n", "\nwhen I first arrived, I was blown away at how Beautiful this resort is and how friendly and lovely the people are. My room was large and spacious, the bed was amazing, I got the room with the spa on the balcony. I used it once and it was great, but probably suit a couple a whole lot better than a solo traveler.

Awesome breakfast menu and great in hotel facilities. love it...\n", "\nA truly relaxing experience was had by myself and my sister, The hotel is fabulous and quite affordable. Spacious rooms and beautiful outdoor gardens with large well maintained pool. We stayed in the Laguna suite which has a private entrance direct to the pool. The staff are excellent, friendly and very helpful. Yoyo makes the best coffees! Breakfast and meals were also excellent. Hotel puts on functions for the guests, barbeque evenings - steak was melt in the mouth tasty as were the lamb chops. One night we were treated to a performance by three Bali girls performing traditional Balinese dancing which was totally enthralling. Transport availability excellent with free shuttle to a couple of places. Free WiFi for those of us who can't get away from their online activities! If you don't want to spend your time among throngs of people on a constant basis I can highly recommend the Swiss-Belhotel Segara Resort. You won't be disappointed.", "Trudy K\n", "\nwe stayed here for 12 nights commencing nov 3rd and booked a pool access room. when we checked in we looked at 3 rooms as the smell in the first was pretty terrible. all the rooms we looked at smelt 'musty' and had a foul odour coming out of the drain in the bathroom. but we settled on the one that smelt least. pool was good. clean and cool. staff were excellent and I couldn't fault them one bit. the hotel is in the middle of know here so you'll need a cab if you want to go anywhere. wifi service was excellent. breakfast buffet service was good but ive never stayed at a hotel where you have to ask for bacon (they have it but its kept in the kitchen and you must ask for it) overall ? it was just ok. its really showing its age with all the dodgy repairs that are easily visible. I wouldn't stay there again\n", "\nI stayed at this hotel with a large group of people for four nights, and we all loved it.

Likely, the hotel could call a Bluebird taxi for you.

The hotel sent someone all the way to Denpasar to deliver the suitcase!\n", "\nAbsolutely loved this Resort. Family of 4, so booked a Loft Room. Upstairs bed enormous! Room very clean & tidy. Air Con very efficient!", "Pools are amazing! The gardens are all established now (photos on web are old) & provide enormous amounts of shade to the pool. Parts of the pool are shaded most of the day. The staff were always lovely - helpful & friendly!", "Take advantage of Free Shuttle to Geger Beach. Great beach, with no harassing from locals to buy!

Clean beach!", "My only low point was breakfast - not a huge selection available, but what is available was quite enjoyable.", "Will definitely be staying here again!\n", "\nWe stayed in July 2014 for 3 nights. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is not near anything but there is a free shuttle bus service to the beach and to Bali Collection. The restaurant and buffet breakfast were amazing and the pool was also very nice. The hotel also has free wifi.\n", "\nWe booked online and stayed at this hotel for 6 days with two kids. Location: the hotel main road is right oppostie of Nikko hotel, you can tell taxi driver, it seems every taxi driver knows where Nikko hotel is. like other hotels around nusa dua beach, this hotel does not near any shops or restaurants, you have to take taxi or free bus to Bali Collection to go out. The hotel also runs a free shuttle to access to the near beach every day. A very small dairy next to the hotel entrance selling instant noddles and ice blocks etc. We find staff at this hotel are very friendly, buffet breakfast is excellent, quite a few choices with combination of Asian and European food, again restaurant staff are polite with smile all the time! Two good sized swim pools for adults and kids, beatiful pools, very comfortable to lay down and enjoy free time and watch kids playing. A large queen sized sofa bed with comfortable firm mattres at lougne, and a queen bed upstairs, the family room is large enough to sleep four adults.\n", "\nThis hotel is great value. It isn't positioned close to the beach but the pool area is lovely. It is worth paying the extra for a room with pool access. The hotel gets a nice breeze as it is on a hill and this is great if you are going to Bali in the middle of summer. The buffet breakfast is amazing but I would go to Bali Connection ( easily accessed by shuttle) for dinner- there is a huge selection of restaurants there. The staff are so accommodating and really go the extra mile. The hotel itself is a little tired especially the bathrooms but the bed is very comfy and the rooms are keep very clean. Easy and cheap to get shuttles to everywhere- go white water rafting! Overall a quite oasis away from the busyness of Kuta and I would definitely stay there again.\n", "\nTheir hospitality were quite a spot on. I can complaint a lot about my room condition like, broken phone (that they changed immediately after I reported, but with no number information. Glad that I've memorize at least the receptionist number), really really smelly bed, worn out interior, and horrific decoration of bloody cloth hanged on the air conditioning system on third day of our stay idk if it was put there for halloween decoration or smth.", "But let say that the services had made my mouth shut up. They're really willing to help us, and smile a lot. I wish their restaurant were bigger or at least I don't need to see the store room door next to miso soup counter. I love their sausage tho.", "They have free shuttle bus going around Bali Collection, Geger Beach and Hotel Nikko next door. If you were bored with room service maybe you can go to Nikko to enjoy splendid dinner which of course, cost a lot.", "Overall, it was very good vacation especially if you need some get away from real life. Oh, and people at Nusa Dua are much nicer than in Kuta, that's for sure.\n", "\nSupporters of the Bali Pink Ribbon Walk. Friendly, very accommodating service. Breakfast catered to all tastes. Some issues with wifi in the room, however always worked in the lobby and restaurant. In a part of Bali surrounded by massive resorts this place was comfortable and small enough to feel homely. Nusa Dua location at an affordable price and no compromise in comfort or hospitality.\n", "\nWe stayed at the Segarra for 8 nights in September and loved it! Our room was well appointed and clean. The staff were all lovely and remembered us throughout our stay, noting when they hadn't seen us by the pool. The pools are amazing and the food served next to them while sunbathing was delicious. I would recommend the steak bagel. We had dinner in the restaurant one night and while it tasted delicious, it was unfortunately not very warm. Cocktails in the bar were always good quality. There was a decent size fridge in the room to store water and drinks and the air con was the best I have ever experienced. I would happily stay at this hotel again!\n", "\nWe stayed with extended family at the tail end of our bali trip. This hotel is a little run down but nice all the same. The staff were extremely friendly and they were happy to play foosball with my son - which he thoroughly enjoyed!! So glad to see staff willing to make customers stay enjoyable!! This hotel is a little out of the way, but the hotel does have a regular shuttle to the Bali collection and gregar beach.

The price is exceptional for what is received. We made friends with one of the hotel staff 'Rama' who filled our trip with alot of laughs. .his service was terrific he even went out and organized a lovely sunset dinner for us and offered to drive us to and from after he had finished work..expecting nothing in return. The pool at this hotel is defiantly its strongest point..very clean always supervised, room service menu is also very reasonable and food is lovely. The shuttle service is also great we were able to go to Bali Collection and Gerger beach and be back at the hotel for dinner thanks to the prompt shuttle service.", "To the manager of this hotel..please recognize Rama for his suberb service he truly is a valuable asset to your hotel. If we recieved even half of his great hospitality anywere in Australia we would feel lucky. I hope one day he will be recognized and hopefully obtain a well deserved promotion.

First floor has living room area and bathroom, while second room is open bedroom with queen size bed and desk and chair. The living room has sofa bed that you can request to have it expanded into full-queen-sized bed covered with linen. You can also request extra pillow. With such configuration, 4 adults and 1 kid can fit in this loft room just fine. ", "The problem is, first floor has central aircon, and one of the ventilation is on top of right side of the sofa bed. when the aircon is turned on, the water start dripping (slowly) from the ventilation. The second floor has its own split aircon. I stayed at room 609 at first, but the AC at second floor didn't help to cool down the heat, so we requested to switch room on our third day. Some tips: if you choose to have loft room, do not stay on 6th floor (top floor), as Bali's heat will get trapped inside the room and the aircon will not help to get rid of it.", "Firstly, i have very high standard on the meaning of 'clean', what i said here might be exaggerated for some people. The bathroom smell something.. unpleasant. It's basically not properly cleaned! there are ants everywhere, dark stain in the corner! and the shower floor is mouldy.

The housekeeping staff seemed to spend no more than 10 minutes cleaning our room, and there were numerous problems, from little things like only creamers and no coffee in the room (so annoying early in the morning!) to bigger things like not cleaning the room at all, to telephoning us during a mid-afternoon nap to ask us if we need the room cleaned--because the Do Not Disturb sign was hanging on our door. Huh?? Really!??", "Like other reviewers, we also experienced the ghost that walks up and down the stairs (since the stairs are connected through the next room). Spookiest thing ever, and I am not sure if can all be explained by the connecting staircase. Guests need to be told about this prior to learning about it at 1am, shocked and huddling together in fear.", "It was frustrating that the partygoers next door to us kept us up a few nights, even more maddening that the front desk staff did nothing about it after being told, and even more crazy that the morning manager did not inform the night manager after we complained.", "Wifi was spotty.", "All in all, its a nice property, just managed wrong I think.\n", "\nMy wife and I spent 8 nights here and had a great time, however you have to be aware that this hotel is a bit outa the way, I was well aware of it but it seemed other people weren't. They do offer a shuttle bus every hour to the collection, however if you miss it or it is to full, as we found out ( it was full), you will have to catch a taxi due to them unfortunately not offering a lift down. The other thing is the single restaurant is a bit over crowded at breakfast, as there is a lot of rooms but only one smallish restaurant. other than that the pool was great, the staff were fantastic and the room was good. I personally am not sure if I would go back as it just did not have enough activities and having a quiet drink was very costly there.

The compromise is that it is not on the beach, but there are free shuttles to/from Geger beach (less that 5 minutes away) and the Bali Collection Outdoor Mall. If you aren't bothered about surf/sand, there are 2 lovely pools & hot tub to choose from. Stayed during the last week of August and it felt like we had the place to ourselves. Staff were so friendly/faultless. We had a swim-up room, which was fab - lovely patio, comfy bed & powerful rain shower. Breakfast is included, ranging from pastries, pancakes, sausages, toast, local choices (e.g noodles and porridge), cereal, fresh fruit & an egg station. Nothing is within walking distance but taxis are frequent and cheap, or you can hire a driver for the day (as traffic is horrid). We were kindly given a free late check-out without even asking (until 4pm) as our flight wasn't until the evening.

The plus side is the pool areas and premier rooms. Two resort style pools with one having a shallow side for toddlers etc. Plenty of sun beds. Hotel was quiet so we had the pool to ourselves most days. We had a premier room which was large, had a comfortable king size bed and huge balcony. Bathroom was a little tired. Breakfast was very basic, more Chinese options than western options. Spa was great, very affordable for hotel prices! Complimentary shuttles round the clock to Geger Beach and Bali Collection.

Not sure I would want to pay a high end price for this but we got a bargain and enjoyed it at that price!\n", "\nExperienced 4 days here with my Wife/20 month old Son and it's been great.

We stayed in a room that we could enter the pool directly from our ground floor balcony, it was so convenient. You never had to worry about getting your towel, sunnies, hat etc. to go to the pool it was literally at your back door (great room). The hotel was almost full from what the staff told us but we never found the pool or any areas crowded. In fact we almost always had the pool to ourselves by 4pm every day. There are two massive lagoon pools and they are sparkling clean - pool staff are always cleaning the area.", "The breakfast was great with a large selection including freshly cooked eggs to your liking. We dined once in the restaurant in the evening but the food wasn't very good and the selection was limited and not a good variety.That was very unfortunate because we had to go out every night to dine.

Always change your money with an official money changer either in the Circle K supermarkets or similar because we had a money changer on the street try to trick us. He was a bit like a magician and when he saw we were aware what he was doing he corrected it but then tried again to get us to larger notes. I would say avoid the money changers on the streets.\n", "\nstayed three nights very good rates clean rooms friendly staff the food at restaurant very good pools are amazing this hotel is a bit out of way, they have free shuttle service to shopping centre 50000 rupiah taxi return( it isn't close to much you need to use transport ) had a very good stay and would stay again thank you to all staff\n", "\nThis hotel is just amazing!

It has it own marbled jacuzzi, and direct access to the pool was fantastic. Highly recommended. The buffet breakfast was also quite good.

There are new toll roads (at $1 / 10,000Rp) which make the journey quicker and uninterruptable. We arrived in the evening and it took approx 20mins to get there. Typical Taxi fares are around the 150,000Rp range. Hotel taxi to/from airport is around 200,000-300,000Rp. ", "The Hotel is near the new Mulia and Nikko Hotels. The hotel itself is nicely embedded in lush surroundings which provides a pleasant ambience and privacy. For those wanting hotels nested side-by-side, this place is not for you. There is a free shuttle service from the hotel every hour to the Collections shopping area in Nusa Dua which has restaurants and boutique hotels with a small supermarket (good for stocking up on beer, beverages and snacks). There is also a pharmacy in that area. Return shuttles are every hour. Always get there 10minute before scheduled time as they do not wait. We ate at one of the restaurants and was thoroughly disappointed with the quality of food. Near by is the Nusa Dua BEach Grill.. which provided the best dinner on 2 occasions and the WORST New Years eve experience (will write up a separate review for that)... it offers free pick-up and drop off from hotels in the Nusa Dua area. A great place to shop for local goods and grocery items is at HARDYS which is 10min from the Swiss Belhotel Segara hotel (taxi fare around 50,000Rp). A case of Heineken beer is 420,000 Rp a case of Bintang around 350,000Rp. There are money changers around there too... one outside the entrance and a better one next door attached to the petrol station. HARDYS sells alcohol, wine, beer, spirits and mixes, grocery items, fruit, foods and snacks, toiletries, souvenirs and clothes.", "ARRIVAL/RECEPTION: The foyer is large and has a clean and pleasant feel to it. The reception/guest counter had very friendly staff and had a reasonable command of english. Typical for Indonesia and South East Asia in general.. locals are very polite, softly spoken and very helpful. Concierge were quick to collect our bags and show us to our room (another story).", "ROOMS: We had booked the Premiere Pool view room (with balconies overlooking the pool and interconnecting rooms, as we were travelling with my wifes boys). Upon entering the rooms we were greeted by strong unpleasant odours.. typical of drains in damp tropical countries. The room was clean with marble floors. The bathroom, however, was another story... it appeared to have had NO maintenance since the hotel opened... there was mold on the grout, on the sliding screen, was the source of the unpleasant odours which seemed to be originating from the drains. The lighting in the bathroom was a harsh but lowly lit light which was totally inadequate.. one light in the centre of the bathroom and a neon over the mirror.. The toilet/WC itself was clean. You would expect to see this quality in a 2* hotel (not that i have ever stayed in a 2* hotel). It didnt take long for me to see the front desk and indicate that the rooms were below the quality expected and confirmed that this was indeed a 4* hotel???", "The options I had planned were either new rooms (or upgrade to Lagoon Pool access rooms, or change hotel as the rooms were certainly not to 4* ratings). We were upgraded to the Lagoon Pool Access rooms, on the ground floor. These rooms were identical to the Premiere Pool View rooms apart from having directly access to the pool via a plunge pool. The quality of the room was somewhat the same as a premiere and the bathroom was slightly better.. they did not have mould on the grout or on the shower. Still, however, there was evidence that maintenance or improvements were a non-event. Lighting was still very low, which proved difficult to shave in. The bathtub was indeed very high making getting in and out somewhat hazardous, especially since the floors were flooded with water when taking a bath. Water literally poured onto the floor .. as any water that fell outside of the tub ended up pouring onto the floor, despite the sliding shower screen (a design flaw). Stepping onto wet marble is hazardous and on one occasion i was lucky enough to regain my balance without doing a back flip. The bathroom also had the odour problem (we ended up going to the local grocery store to buy air freshner). The water pressure was good with a hand shower, rain shower head and bathtub. WAter temperature had the full range from very hot to cold. The faucets were loose and the glass shelves crooked. I would suggest removing the existing cold-white globes and putting warm-white globes and installing a few addition lights over the tub and toilet area.", "The room itself was minimalist.. the fridge was empty ( a good thing for us as we bought our own beer and alcohol and stocked up) without having to pay inflated hotel prices.. (there is also a shop on the lobby level that sells snacks, beer and amenities at reasonable prices.. slightly marked up from local shops.. ) There was no room information in or room (room 115).. no directory of services etc... fortunately the other room we had did have a telephone directory (in-house) so we found out how to make room-to-room, housekeeping and outside calls. There is a safe in the for storing valuable effects (but as we all know, there are over-riding codes which management is only supposed to know.. so i never use them). The television had a good range of movies/satellite tv and the remote control worked well. Lighting in the room was adequate with your typical range of lights (bedside, door entrance, floor-standing lamp) The fridge was typical size and could accommodate about 12 beer bottles, 4-6 soft drink cans and room in the door with a small Freezer section. The fridge worked well. The room itself was very clean and there was cleaned regularly.. the floors were marble and the furniture wooden. The sliding door leading out to the verandah/plunge pool spanned the room with a light translucent curtain allowing light in but maintaining privacy and a block out curtain which functioned very well at keeping the room dark (it spanned from end to end without gaps). The verandah had wooden boards, had two chairs and a small table.. (we provided our own candles)... the plunge pool was ideal.. giving one the extra privacy. which led into the main pool. There were plants in the garden bed between the plunge pool and main pool which provided an excellent natural screen and ambience. The plunge pool was cleaned every morning and all leaves removed. The bed was large (Kingsize i believe) and very comfortable. Clean linen provided everyday and the pillows perfect. All electrics worked well, including the light switches both at the door and bed-side. I would have liked to have had a small table in the room, as when room service was ordered there was really no place to eat apart from the front table/shelve. There was one chair in the room (two would have been better as there are usually two occupants.. so would be a little more practical when ordering room service).", "Housekeeping were very prompt and accommodating providing extra towels or toilet paper on demand. Housekeeping staff were very courteous and friendly. There are electronic 'do not disturb' and 'do not clean room' near the door. Housekeeping regularly cleaned the room and when you have inadvertently left the 'do not clean room' on, housekeeping will call in the afternoon to confirm that indeed you do not want the room cleaned. Two bottles of water were provided regularly every day. Could not fault housekeeping. Great job.", "THE POOL: Definitely the HIGHLIGHT of the hotel. For those (like us) which focuses on the pool (Size, cleanliness and overall enjoyment) this was faultless. The ONLY downer was that the pool did NOT have an in-pool bar. For those using with the pool access rooms, this isn't an issue.. but those not privy to these rooms it provides a minor inconvenience. On some days we stayed in the pool for more than 5 hrs... they appear to use reverse osmosis purification so there is no chlorine (or the after effects of it). The water was always crystal clear and had a VERY fresh feel about it (unlike chlorinated pools). No stress on the skin, eyes, hair or bathers. Pool staff were very courteous and the towels always fresh and clean on hand. The water depth is uniform through the pool (the other pool has two different depths .. more suitable for young children (so if you are requesting a pool access room with young children request the other pool where the water fall feature is). The pool surrounds were kept very clean and plenty of lounge chairs.", "BREAKFAST: Breakfast was buffet style. The staff were always very friendly and courteous. On the negative side, they always had to be asked for coffee and top-ups. Cutlery was clean and seating well provided for. NO airconditioning on the inside seating (apart from some free standing portable air-coditioners) which provided for an extremely hot, humid and unbearable sitting. Fortunately there was outside seating (about 10 tables) however, you had to put up with smokers (they were quite a few) so you have the option of cooler sitting with cigarette smoke or no smoke but hot unbearable sitting. Food wise, there was an omelette and waffle station (side by side) with very courteous staff.. they did have trouble keeping up with customer orders (however, there were some very rude and difficult people) There was also an asian section, fruit and juice section, a pastry/bread section and the main section and a cereals section. The fruit and juice section consisted of 3 cut fruit (typically papaya, honey dew and watermelon), 3 juices (typically three of either orange, mango, guava, apple or pineapple). There was also a small selection of whole fruit (typically mandarines). Omelettes were always well made, the other areas were average but i would say the main section was below average.. usually 5 or 6 dishes and focused more on asian breakfast with very little catering to vegetarians (typically friend noodles, fried rices, a potato dish, a baked bean dish, steamed fish and sausages). The coffee on the other hand was great. I would give the overall performance of the breakfast below average when compared to most 4* hotels ( 4 out of 10).", "ROOM SERVICE (food): We ordered the grilled salmon the first time and my wifes son the double chicken breast. The food was delivered promptly, very well presented and delicious (much better than the breakfast experiences). The second time we ordered the same dishes but added the banana fritters for desert... consistent quality and reasonable pricing. Once again, since there was no table and few chairs we had to eat it sitting on the bed. Overall was throughly happy and impressed with the quality of the food and presentation.", "BAR: No comment on the bar, as we did not patronise the bar.. it appeared to have a focus on tea- derived alcoholic beverages and appeared to be frequented more by the european guests than the Australian guests.", "SPA SALON: The day we were leaving we booked a spa treatment for my wife and myself. The staff were very friendly and the facilities relatively clean ( i would like to have seen a cleaner environment). I had booked for a neck/back 30min massage (85,000Rp) and my wife a 2 hr treatment (roughly around 235,000Rp and then added a nail treatment... when we signed out we ended up with bills of (175,000 and 550,000 respectively)... i did not have the time or inclination to challenge this, but perhaps if the hotel manager reads this can provide me with a reason (as the 21% service charge does not equate to the charges).. My wife enjoyed her treatment, but the quality of the nail treatment was way below (wife had to redo her nails). My massage was ok.. did expect more on the neck (since it was a neck/shoulder massage). Apart from the excessive unaccounted charges it was an average treatment ( i would recommend to use outside services).", "OVERALL: The highlights were the pool and room services. The lowlights included the bathroom and overcharges for SPA treatment. The rest was average. This hotel has the potential to REALLY impressive if they fixed up the bathrooms to a 4* quality expected. It does appear to be the main area that most complaints are focused on. Definately a consideration of a POOL is a key attraction, if not, then i would suggest another destination. If the bathrooms were brought up to standard then HIGHLY recommended for all. Proudly displayed at the front desk is the TRIPADVISER 2013 rating of 4/5 circles.\n", "\nProbably a decent hotel when it was new, the Swiss is clearly past it's prime, which shows in everything. The staff was nice, but they really struggle with English (even basics like The Bill Please caused considerable difficulty sometimes). The rooms were dark and stripped from anything that could be removed by guests (!) including e.g. dustbins. Breakfast was just plain bad, with everything clearly done as cheaply as could be. The remote and isolated location made it even worse during the rainy days when there was literally nothing to do.\n", "\nI stayed for 2 nights with my sister and grands. Very nice pool and waterfall. But I think the location is bad for you who wants the crowd. Limit breakfast. But I have a problem with room 510, the electric power near the lamp under the TV is a lil bit lax.\n", "\nSpend two nights at this property with family (wife and mother in-law). Check in late (almost morning, 3.30 am), they upgraded the room from Superior to Premier. Thank you for that. The front staffs are diligent and kind. They happily help my mother in law (she's 60) finding her room. ", "The room are large and cozy. Balcony is facing the pool, nice scenery. For surrounding, I could say it wasn't a good place to walk in crowd. No body or structure in more then two kilometers. Such a sanctuary. For you in finding a crowd you shouldn't choose this property. Totally out of nowhere. But, for you who prepare for nice sleep, with car ready to go around out of the neighbourhood, then you can choose this property.", "Choice on breakfast is not superb. But, a lot of dish you can try on. And so when you reserve a dish from the room dining menu. So many choice on paper, but you will not find it through the phone. ", "For the service provided by the staff, I could say great. They easily come and finish what we ask for something on hotel related.", "So, I still want to come back to this property for relaxing mind and body after a continued trip around Bali.\n", "\nI stayed in this hotel for three nights during a conference nearby. Never known this on before, so I trusted my office in rsvp SBS. ", "SBS is located in Nusa Dua Bali, near Grand Nikko, Mantra, Mulia, and Mercure. All of these hotels are located outside the core Nusa Dua complex which is much well maintained and developed, compared to the area where SBS is located.", "SBS itself is not located on the main road. It is located some 400 meters through a road, opposite of Grand Nikko. Although some walking, the view is nice and in less than 7 minutes you'd arrived.", "The hotel has a nice environment and well maintained lobby. Nice and helpful staff. The room is nice, clean, and very comfortable. Really love it. The pool is great. The breakfast is standard breakfast. Don't forget this is a 4-star hotel, and don't have the 5 stars luxury. You'll love the breakfast. A/C is great (it will stop working if you open the sliding door to your balcony).", "Next time I will bring my family to this hotel.\n", "\nWe spent a week here and it was absolutely perfect. The staff were fantastic and we got a free room upgrade. The pools were lovely, big and mainly empty as we visited in low season. The breakfast buffet was yummy and so was the restaurant for dinner. The ladies in the spa were fantastic.\n", "\nWe stayed in one of the loft rooms overlooking the ocean. The rooms are a generous size and even though we had a few problems to start with like mossies and air conditioning the staff did everything they could to help. I have never come across such courteous and helpful hotel staff which is what I will truly commend them for. I loved the spa ( very well priced) and the kids enjoyed the lagoon pool. The breakfast buffet is brilliant. Overall we had a great time. The hotel is a little out of the way (which is perfect if you're looking to unwind) but they have a regular bus service to the beach and the bali collection shopping centre. Some really nice restaurants and shops in there. Thank you to all the staff members and especial thanks to the ladies at the spa. They were fantastic.\n", "\nThe staff were courteous and helpful and we were offered a free upgrade (after a little negotiation) when we discovered that one of our rooms would not be available till 6 pm. The rooms were pleasant enough with a good-sized balcony overlooking the pool, although the shower in the deep bath presented a little difficulty for one of the guests (an older woman). The hotel's location is good if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of Bali but a little inconvenient for us as we needed to take transport to shops. The beach was about a five to ten minute walk away. The staff at reception and restaurant were friendly and courteous. We really enjoyed our two evening meals but the breakfasts were fairly average. The treatments in the spa were a little disappointing as they did not go for the time advertised and paid for.\n", "\nI would definitely not recommend this hotel! My family and I booked this hotel and whilst the room was clean the service staff were rude! ", "We found a staple in my young daughters breakfast and when staff were approached they really did not show any concern.", "One of the children accidentally broke a glass and we had approx $12 Australian dollars charged to our pom bill. It took 3 days if arguing to have it removed!!!", "Stay away from this hotel to enjoy your holiday\n", "\nA typical western-international hotel, but away from the gated-community up-market hotels and the noise and bustle of the village. We booked for three nights (in case we didn't like it or there was a building site next door) and stayed an extra five nights.", "Five minutes walk to a good beach and a five minute free shuttle bus to a really great beach. Also regular shuttle buses into 'town'. Good buffet breakfast. Friendly staff, as everywhere in Bali.\n", "\nAmazing, been coming her since the 80's to Bali that is, and stayed all over the island. Thought we would give this a go as we are travelling with 2x children 5 and 10 and Aussie school holidays at the moment so Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Sanur are all busy. This resort is perfect, 2x pools the coldest and 2 of the biggest you will find. The staff are friendly but not in your face. The rooms are clean and spacious. The only let down is we can't find a flight to stay longer. There are many hotels in Nua Dua, and we have stayed at some of the best, but this place is an absolute gem. The rooms have direct pool access if desired, I think you have to be 15+, were on the second floor with huge balcony's over looking pool and connecting rooms. Give this place a go you won't regret it!\n", "\nWe are a family of 2 adults and 5 year old twin girls, so we booked a loft room which we were very happy with. We had a lovely view to the ocean, the room was clean, well furnished, had a good airconditioner, a reasonable bathroom and was serviced daily to a high standard. The most impressive aspects of this hotel were the delicious breakfast and the staff. The service delivered by the pool staff (Fawzi and friends) was exceptional and the breakfast staff were extremely professional, friendly and very consientious. Congratulations to all of the waiters and the lovely male omlette/waffle chef. The boys at the porters desk and cafe/bar were also delightful. I made a few special requests and the staff went out of their way to assist. We loved sitting in the outdoor area, listening to the waterfall and enjoying our breakfast each morning which is included in theh cost of the accomodation. ", "Helpful Hints: As this hotel is 'out of town', you will need to access some form of transport as walking is not an option. We used the complimentry shuttle bus to Bali Collection Shopping Centre and to Gergers beach almost everyday. The porters will also call a metered taxi for you and it will cost approximately $3AUD to get to the Nusa Dua market at the main gate or Bali Collection. Nusa Dua Beach Grill provide a transport vehicle at 5pm each day and we enjoyed eating here. In fact most restaurants and spas in the Nusa Dua area will pick you up at the hotel and return you. The staff at reception will call and make the transport booking. We had massages at the beach for 80,000rp or approx $8AUD which were fabulous. (They will try to charge you 120,000rp, but you dont need to pay this much). I would recommend that you take a bottle of almond oil or your favourite massage oil as the oil used by the woman at the beach appears to be mineral oil which is unhealthy. Arrive at breakfast before 730am to get a table in the outdoor area of the restaurant. The indoor area is not as pleasant and can get noisy when it starts getting busy.", "Recommendations for improvement: ", "Doors- The doors to each room have to be 'slammed' to close properly and they are very noisy. We were woken on many occassions by other guests coming back to their rooms late at night and simply closing their doors.", "Transport- Guests would benefit by the hotel offering a shuttle twice daily to the Nusa Dua market/restaurant area an alternative to going to Bali Collection. ", "Children- As there is no Kids Club, a simple room with some toys, colouring books, reading books, a DVD player and TV and dress up clothes would be an excellent addition for families with young children.", "Spa- The spa lacks personality and is quite sterile. It would be nice to see a more traditional 'Balinese' style injected into the space. The uncomfortable, 'upright' black leather chairs used for pedicures are inappropriate and the staff seem unmotivated. I would not recommend the spa or the spa treatments especially when there are so many other well priced, quality options in the Nusa Dua area. ", "Breakfast- Tea should be strong and dark. Please make your tea stronger as it really detracts from the otherwise fabulous breakfast. ", "Overall, we had a fantastic stay at this hotel and we really enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere. It was excellent value for the price we paid and I would recommend this hotel. Thank you for an excellent holiday.\n", "\nyes it is like a solitaire away from all the hustle and bustle of civilisation it is quite a pretty place with awesome breakfast even a staunch vegetarian like me was looked after the rooms are adequate with a nice balcony the staff generally was nice polite young and smiling non intrusive and non interfering always helpful here is a list of things that would make it far better a single phone instrument at far end of room was much trouble the lighting was very poor too one cannot definitely read found drinks too expensive and they were too frugal with munches hardly any choice for vegetarians in dinner menu but i guess that is entirely our fault and fate adjust or suffer adequate english but often communication a problem with the staff couple of pastas and pizza dishes might help did not have time to enjoy pool and spa perhaps next time?\n", "\nUpon arrival my husband and I were upgraded to a Premier Pool View room, beautiful basket of fruit in room, second day a lovely homemade chocolate cake arrived for our 30th Anniversary, late 3pm checkout, all at no extra cost!! Room and bathroom cleaned everyday, clean towels, 2 bottles of water each day, bed was big and comfortable, staff friendly and smiling, you can book a taxi from the foyer also free internet in foyer area, breakfast selection was wonderful and changed everyday and always topped up, pools are clean and the best we have every seen in 30 years of travelling to Bali, free shuttle to Bali Collection every hour, another free shuttle to the Geger Beach but there is also another nice beach if you walk down beside the Nikko Motel, I have nothing negative to say about this Motel and would recommend this Motel to anyone wanting a relaxing holiday away from the hussle and bussle of Kuta/Legian. Loved every minute of our stay and a big \"Thankyou\" to all the friendly staff and Management.\n", "\nSpend a week at this hotel on the hill. Friendly and helpful staff.

Located a little too far from all the shops and caffes. You get a free shuttle to the Geger beach, that is beautiful, and to Bali collection. Bali collection is a place with many shops. Prices cheaper than in Europe. Hotel is quiet, never looks crowded. Great breakfasts.\n", "\nWe spent 2 nights in a poolside room (where the balcony has a wading pool attached to the main pool). Room and pool were great and fantastic value for money). The beds, as for many places in Bali, were hard and only big bulky pillows available.

Breakfast ok Waffle yum. Pool area nice but hard to get service down there have to order at lobby before you go to pool. Food ok not the greatest.

It is opposite the Nikko Hotel and guests are given the opportunity to visit the local beach (Geger) or the Bali Collection Shopping Centre in a free 1 hourly service which includes hourly pick up as well. The rooms are large and very comfortable. The bathrooms look old but the hotel is only 2 years old, I realised it is because the tiles are unglazed and do not handle scuff marks very well. This is the only downside to this great hotel which also has 2 huge swimming pools. This hotel has superb staff and superb food. We are so glad to have stayed there.\n", "\nSwiss-belhotel Segara Resort & Spa was above of what i expected. What you see is what you get, as shown in the pictures. Extremely friendly & professinal staff to take care of you. I would always recommend the place. The best attraction was the room with direct access to the pool, where i spent most of my time. There is a shuttle bus available for shopping purposes, where you would be dropped off at a place called Bali Collection. 'Value for money'\n", "\nI stay for 2 nights in this hotel. This is a very good hotel to stay, especially for those who like to relax and to enjoy life without too many activities. I stayed at Pool Access Room, which is very nice room with a plunge pool that is connected to the main pool at the end of the terrace. So I really spent most of my time in the pool. The pool is very clean. There are 2 people who clean it in the morning and in the evening. The pool is open for 24 hours. The service is also very good. The Room service is also very good. I order some good food for dinner time. The Barbeque Ribs is awesome. Breakfast is also quite good, with several food varieties. Hotel provide transportation to and from the beach, but for me the hotel lagoon is already look cool. Bathroom is the only thing that I do not really like. There are glass covering half the bathtub, so it is quite difficult to enter the bathtub. There is a little space between the glass cover to the wall, so the the water leaks thru the wall and make the floor wet. The drainage is very slow, so I have to wait about 20 minutes to empty the bathtub.

Not to mention the view whilst eating in the restaurant was Devine! We used the shuttle bus to Bali collection most days which was great and alway on time, we always used the shuttle bus to Geger Beach and this was only about 2 minutes in the bus and again always on time.

My large room was very clean with all bath products at your disposal, a rain shower, large balcony and from my bed a nice view on the lagoon pool which is so large, from front and back of the hotel. There was a shuttle bus to take you at Bali Village and another shuttle bus to go to the beach. Of course, there is no beach around and no restaurant or other thing around, that is the only thing I can say about it but you have everything you want in the hotel. I suggest strongly that they improve their menu because there is no enough variety on it, not enough balinese food and vegetarian food. The view from the dining room at night is really romantic. I will return to this hotel for more days if I can. I was able to afford this expensive hotel because there was 50% discount on Agoda.com and I was out of high season.

The bathroom is equipped, modern and with everything you need, large bathtub, everything in working order. There is nothing wrong with the breakfast here! I've had far worse elsewhere, all the food is covered, there are no flies anywhere that I could see, I even tried the pastries to see if they are indeed stale from other reviews and guess what? They were fresh! They have an omelette stand which was like any other, staff were everywhere cleaning and serving. I don't know what other travelers are complaining about.", "The only negatives I've got so far are that guests are allowed to smoke in the enclosed restaurant, management need to sort that out & that the pool cleaners are invasive and intruding on the guests in the pool access rooms.

Room was OK; balcony door rusted (very hard to open), furniture looked tired and worn, security safe was good, bathroom was OK, air conditioning and TV broken (they fixed both once we complained). Pool area is OK (could be so much better); it's big but only 1.4m at its deepest point (some areas are only 40cm deep), towels seriously need replacing and sunbeds have a lot of mould. Worst thing is the area that joins both pools is also a service entry (it's very dirty and smelly). Service was OK (it varied from person to person - some good some bad).

I called they then turned up with a bath mat?! Once I pointed to bed they got it! Pool was great drinks from pool bar are very weak! Food at reaustrant is average and very poor selection!

And stained!\n", "\nWe could go straight from our room balcony into the swimming pool. The food was good, the kitchen staff went out of their way to fulfil our requests.

They have two pools which are very well maintained and plenty of sun lounges pool towels are also provided I would recommend this hotel to anyone.\n", "\nThis is a lovely hotel, it is perfect if you just want a hotel holiday and that's all. However if you want to anything else you will need transport. The main thing is if you are confined to a hotel the restaurant should be of a good quality and this place is far from that, the breakfast is a buffee is all open, simple things like covering the fruit with nets has been overlooked and there are flys everywhere, it's just not clean at all. We went down for evening dinner and again they just don't get it, as a little appetiser they bring you out cold, stale garlic bread with the morning left over sausage meat cold on top, covered in mayo. It's disgusting and it's not good enough for the price. I got food poisoning in the end and had to go to hospital, it took me two weeks to get over but hardly supposing after what we had seen and unfortunately eaten. ", "The staff are nice and the hotel beautiful, they do offer shuttle to a beach which is a massive massive building site at the moment.

Our stay this time, in comparison to when it was new last year saw a few maintenance let downs. Our shower door cracked loudly everytime we opened / closed it. Rather frightening when its all glass & marble surrounds. But, hardly worth mentioning. Just noticed pools werent as amazing looking, little bit of mould / grout rot was present as well as lots of leaves & flowers in pool compared to last time & small things have been left like the pool chairs are quite filthy & just need a bleach scrub. ", "Overall, still a great hotel. ", "The sliding door to the balcony controls the aircon too (if you leave it open it shuts the aircon off)... The room cleaners often did not lock it properly which turned the aircon off in the room all day.

This was even more appreciated by us when we realised that he was already working well beyond his scheduled finish time.", "When we arrived at the hotel, we were informed that we had been upgraded to a superior room, as a complementary service. The room itself was quite big, with enough room for the two of us and a baby cot for our daughter.", "The views are lovely and the swimming pool exquisite.", "The next morning we had enough time to have breakfast and lunch, which was delicious and fast service.", "The staff at the reception were more than accommodating in calling the airport and letting them know to expect me to go and pick up part of my luggage that I left behind by mistake. They advised me that getting it delivered would not be such a good idea as we were pressed for time and it could actually take a long time for the airport shuttle to deliver it.\n", "\nI loved this hotel, we stayed at 3 hotels on our stay and this was by far the best of them all. The hotel is amazing, it is very clean and comfortable. We had a villa and loved it. So relieved to get here after the hotel we were in before. Staff are great and very helpful. The breakfast is fantastic. If your not in Bali to do heaps of shopping in Kuta this is a great place to stay. It's a little far away from Legian and Kuta in the traffic. I would defiantly recommend this to people if they are there to tour. Was the best 5 days of our stay!\n", "\nWe had a group of close families and friends going to Bali for a wedding. Many guests stayed in this hotel. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hotel for its money. We were welcomed by friendly staff, and a welcome cocktail at arrival. A few girls went for a spa treatment straightaway, and it's very cheap and good. All of our bedrooms had the pool view. It was beautiful at sun site. The breakfast was very nice, plenty of choices. They seem to cater a lot of large groups, as we'd seen quite a few groups during our stay. ", "The only downside was the bathroom. I suspect there was some draining problems in the shower, as the water didn't seem to go down as fast as you would want. We didn't complain because it didn't bother us too much.

You can't really expect to tick all the boxes for the money you are paying. We are happy with our stay.\n", "\nOn a business trip, stayed in this quiet two floor room facing the pool. Breakfast is good with attentive service staff. Take the lift and you can see the beautiful beach. Seems to be full occupancy from big tour groups from russia.

Before we had even departed, the Swissbel porter had already too the initiative and jumped into their private shuttle and ask the remaining guests to jump on.", "Whilst on the Bali Collection shuttle we visited St Regis hotel to pick up guests, despite being still full. The driver told the St Regis guests that they would have to wait 1 hour. I overheard the porter tell their own guests that they would have to call a taxi to get there. St Regis is far more expensive than Swissbel, but I highly doubt that their staff go that extra mile to help their guests.", "One thing that really did ruin our stay here was the noise from other guest's showers.

There are 2 swimming pools, which are very clean and nice, we were enjoyed there (although not so deep, about 1.4metres). Only flaw was that hotel is on the hill, a little bit far from centre of Nusa Dua (about 3-4km).

But, a part that, hotel is lovely, and you will enjoy there for the money you left!\n", "\nChecked in for a week (family of four) along with another family. The hotel accommodated our request to be roomed next to each other before we arrived. We had two loft apartments which suited our purpose very well. From the day we arrived to the day we left we found the staff excellent. Nothing seemed too much trouble and some of the staff remembered all of the kids names which they loved. The breakfasts were more than ample (self serve) and the choice was good. The hotel has two pools and the kids loved both. We picked the hotel as it is away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta but is only a ten dollar taxi ride (private car fitting 8) away.

I'd happily return to the Swiss Bel- Hotel Nusa Dua! :)\n", "\nWe stayed at the Swiss-Belhotel Segara for just the one night before joining family in a different location in Bali, north of Seminyak. I thought the hotel presented extremely well. The layout with the gardens and two large pools were an archetypal and welcome view after the largely unpleasant drive from the airport. Arriving into Bali you have to deal with the nightmare roads and heading straight to Nusa Dua offers only a partial escape from this. Our room was the premier one, although it seems that a lot of people get an update to these rooms anyway. We loved the bathroom and being able to see the TV from the bath - works for couples. The bed was large and comfortable having the balcony overlooking the pool was lovely. We ate at the restaurant and enjoyed that, had beers delivered pool-side and as others have said found the breakfast ample and pleasing. The lay-out can be a disadvantage if you have groups of loud people swimming in or gathering near the pool at night.

As stated shopping and the beach is not easily accessible on foot from the hotel. But we used the shuttle service and were happy with it. ", "I agree that after experiencing and hearing about other parts of Bali I personally would be unlikely to stay in Nusa Dua again.

It's pretty new being only 9 months old. We booked on Asiarooms, and got an upgrade when we arrived. The upgraded room had a mezzanine level. We hired a car, so did not need the complimentary shuttle. The breakfasts are awesome! The staff are very friendly and attentive.The hotel boasts 2 gorgeous swimming pools, which were freezing (for us anyway!!) - they could not have been warmer than 15 degrees C. Bear in mind that when you go to Bali in July the SW monsoon has kicked in, so there will always be a cooler breeze at night, so take a pashmina or light jersey top if you are prone to getting cold. It's good value for money and we would definitely stay there again.\n", "\nGreat place to stay if you just want to relax away from the hustle and bustle.

There were two fundamental issues with the room (there was not bathroom upstairs which was a pain during the night and the upstairs got extremely hot). Due to this, we opted to move back to a superior room. Unfortunately, we ended up with some more problems: broken shower, broken patio lock and room was quite unclean. Again, these were resolved but I was not expecting this from a 4* hotel. The rooms themselves were incredibly plain and bare - no pictures, ornaments, nothing to tell you that you were in Bali.

The best part of this hotel is the two big & wonderful swimming pools, one of which has a very large shallow area so that it is perfect for swimming with small kids like ours. The breakfast was good, but occasionally they were out of a few items. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel offers transportation to & from Geger beach, which is not nearly as nice of a beach as it once was. It's a 10 minute walk to the beach in front of the Nikko hotel, but it's steep & hot returning to the hotel, so not really appealing to us. ", "The rooms were missing a few small details that would have made them more comfortable. Many hotels have bottle openers somewhere in the room but this one did not. Nor did it have a rack on the balcony to hang wet clothes & towels to dry after swimming. This meant that we had to hang our swimsuits on the balcony railing, which is unsightly and blocked our view somewhat when we were sitting on the balcony. Also, I was not really impressed with the housekeeping. Five minutes after we arrived in our room my son stepped on a sliver of broken glass that had not been swept up from previous occupants and he cut his foot. Finally, the hotel is fairly isolated and far away from any shops or restaurants, which means that you need to rent a car or use taxis if you want to go anywhere, though many restaurants in Nusa Dua offer transportation if you eat there, and Bali Collection has a shuttle that goes around to all the hotels in the area.\n", "\nMy wife and I stayed here the last 2 days of our Indonesian trip.

I approached the GM to ask about why the hotel did not have an Alcohol License, despite the website indicating so.... I was informed that they are waiting on the license which was being held up by bureaucracy, so if you want to indulge in a bottle of wine over dinner or enjoy a cocktail poolside then to avoid disappointment I would recommend you pre-checking the alcohol licence has been granted prior to booking. The hotel was still being worked on whilst we were there, but did not cause us any inconvenience.", "Rooms were clean, well appointed, large and reflective of website pics, with efficient air conditioning. My only criticism is the absence of a dressing Mirror in the Room. There are tea and coffee facilities and a bar fridge.", "I can also recommend the treatments and service in the Beauty SPA. ", "No complaints with the service we received from the staff, they were all polite, efficient, with a real desire to serve you in the best possible way and nothing was too much trouble.", "All the common areas of the Hotel and the Pool areas are tastefully and beautifully done. The Hotel was very quiet and this could be due in part to the Alcohol License issue , it certainly prevented us from inviting our friends to the hotel. ", "The breakfast we found to be satisfying and no problems with the variety, in fact if you ask for anything western they will accommodate. We dined in the restaurant one evening, but to be honest, whilst the service was excellent the food we found to be just ok, nothing to shout about. I did however, enjoy a great club sandwich one lunch time poolside. ", "Overall we were satisfied with the hotel and we feel it has great potential once fully completed, operating with a full alcohol license and the little touches like mirrors in the room are addressed.\n", "\nHad a chance to stay here while attending a conference related to my business. The place is clean, the pool is large enough to swim and there is one large luxury van available to take you to Nusa Dua area for a free 1-way trip. The minus things are that the breakfast menu aren't that varied enough and the location is a bit further from the main Nusa Dua area.\n", "\nStayed for 6 nights and really enjoyed it. The hotel is brand new, and very very quiet. The pools are perfect for relaxing, the breakfast is great value and the staff very nice. It really is probably the best value in nusa dua\n", "\nExcellent sea view, very good location, warm greetings from all of the staff working around. ", "Spacious room, big and comfortable bed. Huge balcony with unbeatable Indian Ocean sea view. Attentive service. Love those mocktail. ", "The only thing is the food. ordered assorted seafood plate for in-room dinning, which was of a merely average quality. Breakfast, errr, the omelette was not that fresh as it has just been made upon order; tomato was over-cooked; no fresh veggie. ", "For a luxury resort like this, you can't leave the F&B behind.\n", "\nI checked into the Samambe with my party of 6 on Sunday the 5th of July. The hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels, I have been to and I have been to quite a couple. The service is impeccable, the staff is eager to please and most of all I beg to differ with the last reviewer. The food is scrumpy scrumptious! I don't know what kind of taste buds he or she had, but they are definitely way off the mark. The breakfast is simply amazing! Anything your heart desires. Everyday there is a different a la carte menu, with a vast array of food in the buffet area. The noodle station is simply to die for! Kudos to the food and beverage manager. Samambe is the hotel to come to in Bali !!!!!\n", "\nA hideaway for a honeymoon in a large resort. Wonderful room and service and although slightly expensive, we got everything and more we expected. Friendly staff, great food (even for a vegetarian) and beautiful location. The ONLY downside was the beach but it didn't match up to the rest of the 5* resort.\n", "\nGood location, good view, good room, good services, overall great but not the food. If the food is good, we didn't have to go out of the hotel, would definitely stay and enjoy the hotel perfectly. Anywhere in hotel, the beer was not cold enough and only 2 brands. Burger taste like sands. Breakfast: omelet contain bean sprouts, has sweet taste and very thin. Cheese selections was limited and all soggy. On Indonesian food section, there was nongsim instant noodle. The nasi surabaya which served everyday paired with rendang that taste like sugar. Fruits were not fresh and were soggy. Nasi goreng served in bamboo steamer - felt like it was cooked yesterday and reheat. Overall food selections/variety was limited, small portion and presentation was not appealing.\n", "\nSpent a week at the Samabe with my sister. Our room was like a suite with dining room, living area and separate bedroom. We were ocean front which I recommend. The Indian Ocean is spectacular. The staff is so attentive. You are assigned a personal butler 24 hours a day! He arranged our transportation into town, laundry, etc. The breakfast buffet can only be described as palatial. There is nightly live music both Balinese and guitar pop music. We met the hotel manager who frequently roamed the bar and restaurant checking on his guests. Such a professional and experienced hotelier. The pool and spa are first class. We did a Balinese offerings class and yoga which were both extraordinary. You don't need to walk anywhere as they have golf carts with drivers (called buggies) that will pick you up. The beach club has kayaks and paddle boards and a beach bar, such a special resort. Stay here!\n", "\nFrom the time we were picked up at airport until we left, we were treated like royalty. I have stayed in top hotels around the world but this is my first review because in the past I have received in most cases what I paid for, but at Samabe this was not the case. I have never been to a hotel before where all the staff know your name and everyone greets you so pleasantly\n", "\nOur family visited Samabe in October 2014. The villa was so amazing we booked two additional nights and extended our trip. Could not recommend this place highly enough for pure indulgence and relaxation away from the hustle and bustle. Butler service was amazing, as was everything included in the 'all inclusive package'. It was well worth it and it was a great family holiday.\n", "\nVery very very nice resort excellent place to go very big resorts.Hotel staff,s are very. Nice an there 2 bed room penthouse villa are excellent very nice view an it has ur personal swimming pool.....\n", "\nWell, First of all me and wife selected this place for our honeymoon in bali. We read Great reviews about it from Tripadvisor and we thought to give this place a try.", "When we arrived they actually treated us like we are really special, and we definitely enjoyed this. They served us some refreshments while we were waiting to be talked with the lobby and also added cool towels to get us rid of the heat. Well I wanted to use the towel but there was a stain on it. Yes probably It was dry cleaned and all , It could have been clean but I couldn't use it. Then the hotel staff came and told us our room was not going to be ready until 3 PM.", "Ok I can live with the fact that our room was not ready because we were hungry and could eat then go to our room, however I booked this place months ago. Staff should have been prepared and ready our room before we arrive. ", "We went to the restaurant and had a nice meal. Not perfect but it was ok. Then our room was ready. When we went to the room, I was a bit disappointed. There was a disturbing humidity smell in the room. And all of our sheets had stains on them including pillows.", "Ok lets assume that i can understand that you rushed the room didn't had time to Refresh the air in the room. how about the stains? We were on our honeymoon, This really killed our mood. We told the staff about these issues and we decided to go to the spa so that they can fix these while we were out of the room. ", "The Spa was Ok, The masseuse was ok but the room temperature should have been arranged better, We are trying to relax our muscles in there not get a cramp. When we returned to our room It was Not totally solved but at least we had clean sheets.On the next day I wanted to swim in the ocean but when I went down from those long steppes to the seaside, I saw that It was a Seaweed farm. You cannot use that place to swim. Total disappointment. Our room had a pool also but we couldn't use it because it was very cold. Then we went back to the pool, That is the most relaxing place of the hotel. We ordered some drinks and decided to cool off. ", "We stayed like this for 2 more days. Then When we came back to our room they changed our sheets and they were many stains on them again. Again?! That was it for me so I wanted to change my hotel. And swapped to another hotel and at least we managed to relax a lot there.", "And don't let me get started on the fact that I made my reservation by booking.com and they credit all the amount from your credit card before you even go there. Since It was a present from our father , and his card was not present at that time, They called his house at 3AM in the morning and ruined his day for him also just to get approval, which they would have asked us in the beginning. I don't think I would recommend this place to anyone or Yet alone stay at here again. ", "If it was not for the staff and the hotel itself I would have given this place 1/5, It is not above average.\n", "\nThe Samabe resort could best be described as a Ritz Carlton boutique hotel. We have stayed at many 5 star resorts, all over the world, in years passed and I must say, that we were pretty impressed. I did not give this property a 5 because it lacked in a couple of important aspects which took away from the overall experience, but which can easily be remedied as I explain below. ", "First the positives. ", "The location is beautiful. On the same road as the St. Regis and the Ritz Carlton... The Samabe shares the same views of beautiful beaches. ", "The rooms (especially the honeymoon suite and the villas) are beautifully appointed with amazing views. The honeymoon suite has a great bathroom setup where the bathtub faces a glass window overlooking the ocean (I took my bath 2x per day!)", "The breakfast. Never before was I so eager to get to breakfast in the am. I am usually the \"I will take it in the room\" type. But the breakfast was just awesome. With daily fruit juices, an amazing spread and foigras eggs on the menu (All included in the price of stay, btw), the food was just perfect and so was the service. In keeping with the area culture, the well dressed and very well trained staff, made the whole thing a pleasurable experience. The restaurant itself is beautiful.", "The dinners were equally good and well staffed. And the sunset views from the Blue restaurant were breath taking. This is definitely a romantic place to spend your days in Bali. ", "The staff are definitely that of a 5 star resort and the only time I had to directly speak to a manager, 2 showed up within moments and did everything in their power to make me happy. ", "So what's the problem?", "Activities. This hotel is a bit of a drive to the city, which I said, is common to all of the 5 star hotels in the area, but it fails in providing adequate activities. I will describe those I participated in (and was disappointed by)", "Spa. The facility is ok. The beds are portable and very uncomfortable. Facials are performed on massage beds and lack standard facial equipment. The robe my husband received barely covered his bottom (we still laugh about it) and looked like something that was washed a 1000 times before. The pedicure took 1 hour and was not finished by the time of my next appointment. The location of the spa has no views of any sort. We had another massage in our room and it was not that good either. Just a very poorly run and equipped spa. ", "The cooking class was a joke. Everything, including sauces, were pre prepared. The cook spoke no real English and there was no written directions as to how to replicate this at home. A complete waste of 1 hour. ", "The yoga. That was my biggest disappointment. In an area famous for yoga and a facility where beauty can be seen around every corner, their daily (1x per am) yoga class is under the chappel in a location where the ocean can be seen only when you stand up but other than that one is staring at electrical cables, dirty walls etc. The yoga leader... Nothing special... And the yoga mats were terrible.\n", "\nThis resort was beautiful and had amazing service!!! The rooms and grounds were beautiful, the staff was excellent, and the breakfast buffet was to die for. We were in the ocean front family suite and we had tons of space. Some of our friends were in a villa and it was awesome!!! The service was amazing!!! My only complaint would be that it was far from good surf if you have surfers with you. We had to travel about 30 minutes everyday to surf. However we all agree we would definitely stay again.\n", "\nFrom the second we stepped onto Samabe grounds, my husband and I were absolutely blown away by this resort. The professional dress of the hotel staff, the pristine landscaping, the gorgeous views, and of course, the room! We stayed in a honeymoon suite that came with it's own telescope to look at the stars at night. ", "Our stay was only for three nights, but I could have easily spent a week or two at Samabe. I was a little hesitant about the Unlimited program with the fact that alcoholic drinks are not free until 5pm, but honestly, I really didn't care once we arrived. We spent most of our time lounging at the beach and pool, and plenty of mocktails, water, juice, and sodas were offered. ", "The food was incredible \u2014 with every meal we ate the service, food choices, and overall satisfaction never wavered. If you get a chance, definitely book the Rijsttafel dinner. It's quite the Indonesian experience!", "Another aspect my husband and I enjoyed was the fact that we never felt like the resort was crowded. There were quite a few guests occupying the other rooms and villas, but with the way Samabe is laid out, you have lots of time to yourself and to enjoy a little privacy. ", "Would I go back? Yes in a heartbeat! I wish all the best to the Samabe staff and hope they have a successful future!\n", "\nThe experience to stay Samabe was so wonderful in 3 nights! Beautiful scenes, rich breakfast & warm services. My husband and I felt so lucky and happy to enjoy our second honeymoon in this amazing place. Love, love, love\u2026\n", "\nIt was the first time to join all inclusive package, excellent idea! We love it. We can eat and drink everywhere and anytime. We just relax and enjoy the facilities, no calculation for $$ after paid hotel fees.", "We stayed 2 nights and booked a Ocean Front Honeymoon Suite, but then upgraded to Ocean Front Honeymoon Pool Suite. Yeah! The room has a private swimming pool. Room is clean and big. The view is amazing. In fact, all are same as the photos and description in the websites.", "We joined two signature activities, one was Seawalker and one was Devdan Show. The Seawalker activity included private car out/in hotel transfer. The arrangement was very good. But we were regret for the arrangement in Devdan Show. When arrived at the theatre counter, we were advised that the seats were changed to Category A although we had a reservation letter for VIP seats. After some negotiations, we can keep VIP seats. We think there were mis-communication between hotel and theatre. After returned to hotel, we received a card from the GM to apologise the matter and had some chocolates as gift. Thanks Ralf for the swift action.", "We would like to suggest the hotel to improve for the staff's communication. When check-in, we waited for 30mins, because the reception was not aware we already arrived and arranged to sit at the lounge until I informed them. They apologised that and arranged we took lunch at restaurant before the room was ready. And, although we informed we were late check out at 3:30, the key card was still blocked at 11am. Actually, staffs solved the problem quickly when we informed them. They are nice and friendly. I am sure Rulf will manage the above matter. ", "Overall, we are love to stay at Samabe.\n", "\nOverall, a very pleasant stay. ", "We felt that different aspects of the hotel stay were excellent and some not so much, so we've broken it down into categories. ", "(On a scale of 1 to 5, the latter being excellent)", "Location - 4, great views, beach is not crowded, away from the masses. It's right at the end of the road, so its a little far, but we wanted a little peace and quiet so that didnt bother us.", "Food - 3, loved the concept of being able to have brekkie either at the restaurant or in the room, at any time of day! However, the quality of the buffet was pretty average, not much of local choices. Limited local choices on the ala carte menu and even those were average. Didnt give us much confidence in dining in even though we considered staying in and ordering room service one night. Ended up going out for dinner. ", "Staff - 4, very friendly, attentive and gave great restaurant recommendations. ", "Rooms - 4, large well appointed rooms with great ocean views. Downside, the bed creaks - very strange but this seemed to be a trend as our massage beds also creaked a lot!", "Spa - 2, the massages were excellent - i would give the quality of the massage a 5, however the ambience and \"luxury-ness\" was missing from the experience. The room was warm when we entered, it only cooled down halfway through the session. The beds creaked so badly throughout, we couldnt relax. And lastly, towards the end, an outdoor party started outside and we could hear voices over the microphone.", "Quality of the overall experience as compared to other spas we've had in 5 star establishments would sadly only be a 1. Not quite worth the $$. A shame as the actual massages were excellent. ", "Pool - 4, great views from the pool but the water temp was freezing. ", "One poor experience at the hotel which really annoyed us. One late afternoon, we called the front desk requesting a buggy and a taxi as we were headed to Ku Te Da in Seminyak to catch the sunset. The buggy we requested got \"hijacked\" by another party so we had to wait while they sent another one. When we finally got to the lobby, our taxi hadnt arrived. We requested for it again (twice in fact). By the time the cab arrived, we had lost a precious half an hour which meant we ended up missing the sunset that we travelled almost an hour for. Very disappointing. ", "But otherwise, a very pleasant stay - I wld recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet or romantic vacation that's not fussed about food, or willing to eat at other resorts nearby ( St Regis has an excellent Indonesian restaurant but only offers a set / tasting menu). Bambu Bali is another great restaurant about 20mins away. I won't bother with anything in The Bali Collection.\n", "\nThe minute you arrive at this wonderful resort you will not want to leave. From being greeted with a Frangapani Lai upon arrival, the seamless check in process to the Oceanfront Suite with the most amazing uninterrupted Ocean views the Samabe is like no other place we have ever stayed. The staff are a credit to the management of this resort. Nothing is too much trouble. Super efficient and friendly staff go out of the way to make sure we have everything we could possibly want and more. the Samabe is definitely the most amazing resort we have ever stayed in. We don't want to leave but we hope one day we will be back.\n", "\nI was taken aback at first when I read some of the reviews as to how good could this place actually be? Although the place was reasonably expensive compared some of the other top resorts in Bali, I decided to give this place a go and purchase the unlimited privileges package for 5 nights in Mid-May. This was because of the 1 signature activity a day such as tours, unlimited laundry and all inclusive food with alcohol between 5pm-midnight. Big downer on the alcohol as surely unlimited should mean unlimited and at anytime......if you are really desperate for alcohol before 5pm this is resolved with the free mini bar in your room.", "So we arrived at 7:30pm and a driver from the room was already at the airport waiting for us. The car was extremely comfortable and we were given a fantastic welcome. ", "The place seemed very quiet and after asking, the resort was about 30-40% occupied. May is low season apparently, the days was still hot with temperatures of 30 degrees celcius plus and was visibly cooler in the evenings.", "After our personal registration check-in at the resort, we were taken to our room which was 114 (if I remember correctly). We went for the honeymoon package with our own pool and was looking forward to seeing what this was going to be like.", "The buggy carts that take you around the resort are fantastic. They get you from one end to the other so quick and are easy to arrange. The room was fantastic, the space was huge and the view from the room was one to die for. The butlers are so courteous and provide you with a hand phone so can call them at any point. We never had to call the butler other than once throughout the whole trip.", "If I were to pick out a fault or faults it would be the following -", "1 - The bathroom was way too big ha! Not really a fault of course as it was lovely to experience having two separate sinks at different ends.", "2 - The pool is constantly in the shade and although nice to have, it was very cold. We only used it twice in 6 days and spent more time in the main pool. I did feel this was the only waste as the main pool was very nice and good enough. ", "The shade covering the private pool cannot be helped though as the location of hotel with the view of the sea gives the hotel no choice but to have it this way.", "The food we had in each restaurant was excellent! With the unlimited package we were able to have breakfast, lunch, dinner, room service, and beach and bar food without limitation on what to order.", "We tried the local food, western food, Malaysian food, various starters, many desserts, and a number of different drinks. I couldn't fault the food or service at all.", "The only bad experiences I had if I want to be picky is that I ordered a side dish of fries to go with my main course the one evening and it came after I had finished it so I ended up eating them with dessert. Did it matter? Not really. I am happy eating fries at anytime of the day. The only other problem was the poor waitress forgot to order my drink.", "She realised she had made the mistake, didn't blame it on anyone else and quickly rectified it. The waitress ended up apologising at least 10 times. Mistakes happen from time to time and we are all guilty of this, it's ok. The outcome was I had to wait an extra 10 minutes. No big deal, the drink was worth waiting for,", "Room great, service great, food great, view great, and pool a little cold but what more could I ask for?", "There's more.....", "The daily free 1 signature activitiy that came with the package was a great choice. For our 5 choices we did the following (best to pre-book weeks before arriving to guarantee in case any changes are made to the activities and also some are only available on certain days) -", "1 - Tanah Lot tour. This was an awesome experience with an amazing sunset.", "2 - Uluwatu Sunset Tour. Another excellent view, we watched this cha cha dance which we had to pay extra 100k Indonesian Rupiah. I would probably give this a miss if I had the option again and enjoy the sunset without having to watch a group of men chanting cha cha for almost an hour, it's not bad, just I did get a bit bored after 30 minutes.", "3 - Devdan Show, the VIP tickets is a great touch. Loved it!", "4 - Massage at a spa off site. We originally wanted the therapeutic pool but this was closed for maintenance. Was offered choices of haircuts, various massages but opted for a simple 1 hour massage.", "5 - Full body massage in-room. Couldn't fault it, the two girls that handled this at the resort were excellent. Would have used the spa at resort earlier in the week had there been more hours in the day.", "The other activities which you can do onsite for free included snorkelling, catamaran, and kayaking. This all depends on tides and winds so unfortunately we were unable to try the catamaran.", "There are reviews here talking about the beach full of lots of rubbish and is dirty overall.", "Is it dirty? Yes and no. There is a bit of rubbish but most of it is weeds from the reefs washed up. The tide comes in and out so much at different times of the day, the hotel will not be able to do much about this other than pick trash up regularly which they did.", "When it was high tide, you couldn't venture out far but as soon as it was low tide, you could see fishermen walk out about 150 metres and still be at knee length at some parts.", "The worse part is leaving, to help us get over it our driver stopped off at a convenience store for us to buy some last minute goodies. ", "Overall an excellent resort with great staff, I cannot commend the staff enough, those that took us from one place to the other and to those that we communicated with throughout our stay. I do hope to be able to return here again in the future. ", "Thank you Samabe.

Everywhere is so quite and made us feel so relaxed. Bathroom, bathtub are \"huge\"! The staffs - the driver who picked us up from the airport is very gentle and nice; buggy drivers are very good too, polite, smiley and responsive.", "However, the service definitely can be better. ", "The so called 24hrs butler actually not work quite well as expected. Hotline \"7\" always quite busy, the average waiting time of the operator answering your call is around 20-25 secs, and the operators' English not good, not familiar with their in room dining menu, and wine list. We took 20 mins to order an Australia white wine which is on the in room dining menu not a special request. We also waited 1.5 hrs for our breakfast as they delivered to wrong villa but no one noticed, until we called and called. After that, an assistant manager who expressed his apologies and committed they will do better, promised us to clean our villa right after we left for lunch. However when we back in the late afternoon, our room still as messy as we left, not cleaned at all, even last night's food/drinks were left in our garden.", "I think the internal communication need to be improved. I know the staffs are friendly and nice, so they can definitely be better.", "We appreciate very much Ralf took very warm and generous action to make up all these incidents. Seriously, we are so surprised about it, heartfelt thanks, Ralf!", " I'd recommend Samabe to my families & friends!\n", "\nThis resort is being strongly recommended by my friend for my honeymoon, and we were so enjoyed the privacy, the non crowded / cramping feeling, the comfortable zone for each room and spacious room with top quality of service plus UNBEATABLE Sea View!!! the voice of ocean that lead to us to deep sleep and awaken by the sunrise every day.. What a wonderful stay and holiday i had. I stayed for 7 days and its not enough...

All our expectation were exceeded by quite some margin.", "Yes sure there were some areas to improve but I won\u2019t bother listing the 3 or 4 very minor things I noticed (and have send a personal fed back to the hotel general manager ) .

The way all the staff treat and communicate with the guest , from the GM to the butler everyone great you and has a little chat with you without being pushy , the wide range of guest activities selection is also something we did not expect to have included in our all inclusive package ", "For such an exclusive and luxury resort there are no airs and graces! everyone is helpful and friendly and constantly make you feel at home.

Strong points include great personalised service, dedicated butler, very warm and polite and smiling staff, quick service order turn around time, outstanding ocean views, good Spa and good food. Staff speaks english well and hence no issue in communication. ", "Weak points - poor power adapters, very focussed on honeymooners or just couples rather than families . Sometimes personalised service may feel like too much intrusion into privacy, monkey threats especially if travelling with infant, fewer food options for vegetarians, no complimentary airport pick up or drop if booking was not made directly through the hotel. Overall looks little overpriced.", "Kadek(business in charge), Taashiya (chef),Purwa (butler) and Billy( bell boy ) - made our stay enjoyable and comfortable. They took very good care.

I love the idea of every room have my own butler and I could have my high tea in my room and all drinks in the room and by the swimming pool are all included in the package. On my 2nd day I have to leave very early in the morning to Ubud to visit the morning light on the paddy field, my butler told me that she can arrange to have my breakfast at 5.30am in my room! Wow! I am impressed by your service Samabe. Thank you for bringing me a wonderful experience.\n", "\n3 night doesn't seem to be enough time to stay in this resort. We arrived in bali and then got picked up with 2 Luxury shuttles (we are coming in with 6 adults and 2 kids). Cool towels as soon as we got in the car. Check in process is also very fast, they provided us with coconut juice mixed with lime for the welcome drink. The suite room is very comfortable also, very big. it should fit more than 5 adults. Very wide view of the ocean. The room beverages include beers, soda water, milk, mineral waters, tea, and coffee. Anything that you need will be provided by the butler, even in the middle of the night. fresh fruit, juice, water, anything will be delivered. All i need to do is just call the butler hotline. Room is cleaned 1x a day, and the turn down service to prepare the bed for sleep at night. The bathroom is very spacious also, 2 sinks, 1 extra large size bath tub, fit for 2 persons. The best thing about the bathroom is the water flow rate is so great, very hard just like water massage.", "The public area like swimming pool is quite nice, good for photo taking. you can get any drinks in the pool. The crystal blue restaurant has a very nice design as well, very good view of the ocean, with fish ponds all around. The kids club is considerably ok, but a little more activities and toys for older kids would be better since a lot of the toys looks like for 1-3 years old only. Beach area is quite dull from my observation since not too many people spend a lot of time there. kayak, yoga, and catamaran might be the best thing to do there. snorkeling is not really recommended since not too many colorful fish to be seen. older people please beware since the step from the top to the beach is around 174 steps, so it really takes a lot of energy to go back upstairs.", "Breakfast menu is quite good, fine dining with open kitchen, open from 7-11am only, but the in room breakfast is superb as well since you can order anything as many as you want from the in room breakfast menu. Overall, it was one of the most memorable vacation i ever had. Thank you Samabe\n", "\nI am normally quite a calm reviewer, but words can barely describe how badly this small 8 acre property is managed in some respects. ", "I have just visited Bali as part of my 60th birthday celebrations. To say that I was disappointed by this hotel is a total understatement. It is tucked away in a part of Nusa Dua that is outside the large manicured part where there are many other famous hotels. But one of the claims about this hotel was its private beach.", "Now we all give different weighting to different aspects of a vacation experience, but for me to walk on the beach (even at dawn), swim in the sea, and snorkel is a massively important part of my time on holiday.", "The Samabe villas and suites are built into a hillside, sitting on top of a cliff, with about 120 steps down to the beach. The property itself is immaculately manicured, but this totally stops when you get to the beach. From above it looks pretty with turquoise waters (until you look closely), but when you get to the beach level, what a disappointment. The sea is full of trash, mixed in amongst seaweed, and it is so very bad it is not nice to swim there, and in my estimation, dangerous for children. The result of all this trash in the sea, is that the tide deposits it on the beach. It is EVERYWHERE! See my photos.....", "I was talking to the Front Office Manager about another issue (a good guy, very responsive) and I asked him to relay my points about the beach to the General Manager of the beach area. I sent him all my photos (which with the poor upload time took an hour!). Imagine my surprise 30 minutes later when the response from the General Manager of the beach, via the front office manager) that there is no problem. To be honest this incensed me, as there is a terrible problem.", "And the problem is one of mis-management of the beach staff. They only clean right in front of the sitting area at the bottom of the steps, and only then to the high-tide mark. To the right of the sitting area, in front of the property, are rocks full of trash. There is trash between the high tide and low tide mark, which they make no attempt to clean. And they have like an invisible line where they think their property ends, and beyond this line it is so full of trash it is untrue. Who tells the children not to wander up the beach? It is to all intents and purposes one beach. They could also try and clean up the sea a bit, it would only take a couple of hours with the right sort of boat.", "So the problem is that this management don't care about their overall environment. OK, it is not their fault people drop trash in the sea, but respect for the environment means cleaning the beach.Don't talk about whether or not to change a towel, when there is an environmental disaster on your own property, and in your neighbourhood!", "In 40 years of foreign travel I have not seen a more disgusting and filthy beach than this, and management needs to own this issue, and not attempt to deny it.", "Other than this, it is a small quiet resort geared to the daily wedding which seems to occur there, so it seems a bit soul-less. But for all you wedding planners and honeymoon couples out there, do not choose this hotel if you want to visit the beach!\n", "\nFrom the easiest and fastest check in experience I have ever had, to the most wonderful service you can hope for, Samabe has proven to be the most amazing place that my husband and I have stayed at.", "We can only hope we will get a chance to come back in near future.", "Thank you to all the staff at Samabe and to Ralph-General Manager. You have made us feel very special.\n", "\nStayed 4 nights with wife and 2 kids in the Ocean Front Family Pool Suite. The suite was spacious and nicely furnished with a great ocean view. Although I did not request for a crib for my 2 year old as the suite has two queen beds, I was pleasantly surprised to find a very large crib with blanket, pillow, and two bolsters set-up for my 2 year old daughter and she loved sleeping in it. The beds in the suite are very comfortable and luxurious. The suite included a complimentary re-fill of the mini-bar which had a good selection of drinks. However, since it is a family suite, it would be great if there was more than one small packet of milk. Other nice touches include a utility box which had a range of items including universal power adaptor, flashlight and even scissors. The toiletries provided were also comprehensive. Overall, the suite was very comfortable and well maintained. Housekeeping did an excellent job throughout our stay. Service staff were all very professional and friendly. Special thanks to Mul and all the staff in the west wing for making our stay enjoyable. ", "Breakfast was sumptious with an a la carte buffet as well as a traditional buffet line. The a la carte buffet items were very good and well presented. Particularly enjoyed the steak with eggs, and the pan fried with foie gras! The buffet line had lots of fruits, ham and sausages but would have been better if they had included some traditional egg stations such as scrambled, sunny side up, for those who like eggs without ordering from the fancy a la carte menu. Fruit juices were fantastic and they can mix almost any combination you can think of. Thanks to staff at Rampah Rampah who were very friendly and efficient. Special thanks to Peter, who noticed my wife peeling mangosteens that she took from the fruit station, and brought us a plate of ready peeled mangosteens!", "In-room dining menu was rather limited but overall quality was good. Kid's burger was a little too peppery for young tastebuds and unfortunately the ice/hot chocolate did not meet the kid test. Time from order to delivery was consistent and set-up in our dining room was always professional and well presented. ", "Staff at the Kids club was very engaging and enthusiastic with the kids. However, the club premise is rather small and in need of a renovation/expansion. ", "Dinner at Crystal Blue was an enjoyable experience. The ocean breeze was soothing and the set-up peached above the main pool offered quite a view and was rather cozy. Service was good and staff were all very friendly. Special thanks to Ratna for providing strawberries for my daugther. ", "Overall, a very good resort with very friendly and professional staff. Thanks to all for making our stay so enjoyable. Definitely on my return list.\n", "\nThis is our first time to Bali, we were deciding which location and resort to stay. ", "We were looking for a place where there is beach and not crowded with people, so after reading various comments from tripadvisor, I have decided to try Samabe. ", "I must say at first I was a bit worry of some of the negative comments I read of the resort but given the time was a while back, I think it should be outdated. ", "Overall : if you like to stay in a resort that is not huge (8ha) or big name, you want your private area, not crowded with people, private beach, some non motorized activities. This resort is a good choice! ", "Recommend for couples and young kids. Suggest to book for villa as their outdoor pool is not particularly huge. ", "Stay (villa) - at first we were thinking of suite, then we changed to private villa with pool, it was very good. Our villa has a 4*8m pool, good size room and very comfortable bed (we wanted to know which brand they use!), good size bath room, out door shower and one time refill of minibar drinks per day [oh- the coffee machine weren't that user friendly though, a couple of hotel and resort we stayed uses \"nespresso\" but this one was quite difficult to use so that was negative]", "Guest mix - it was a good mix,we saw French, Brits, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian and don't think we saw mainland Chinese people) whereas when we were at other bigger resort, you could always hear noise. [even some family with kids around 4+]", "Staff: They were really good and always very helpful. In particular Yumi, who helped us for the first 2 nights. We only need to dial \"7\" and they help us on anything. They even organized and pay for our trips and booked our Spa at another hotel. we call buggy/cart where we want to go and they come very quickly. ", "Program : The resort offer \"limited privilege\" and \"all inclusive\", we picked \"limited privilege\" which is very sufficient for us as we don't drink alcohol. We liked the unlimited free flow non alcoholic drinks throughout the day at restaurants, you can have free \"afternoon tea\" anywhere. This was quite good!!", "Lessons: they have free lesson for yoga each day and other activities, we took a free cooking class which was a good experience (only thing is if they open on Sunday too then it would be great as I guess people deciding to stay in Nusa Dua but not the city because they would want to stay in the hotel so it would be great if they could consider 7 days activities)", "Food:", "1) breakfast choice was average - at the restaurant, there were lots of fruits and bread, but it would be better if there are more salads and green veggies or meat selection (for ham, they have 4 choices but the portion is rather tiny)", "2) afternoon tea - it's good as its free, for 2 people there were canap\u00e9 size 2 sandwich and 6 pieces of cake. Except for the size, it's actually quite good Cannot complain as it's free.", "3) lunch - we tried their crystal blue restaurant as well and their calamari fries has a lot in there and it's quite good. At least 3-4 times larger than the portion we get at the \"rock bar at Ayana resort\"", "The wagyu beef burger is rather average because you have to order at least medium or well done. ", "Others minor - ", "A) we asked for a kettle for our room wanting to boil water but the kettle that was given to us was a bit oily and not too useable. We didn't ask for a change so didn't get hot water at last. I guess you wouldn't need it normally", "B) toilet was clot one night but so we asked for assistance when we head out for dinner. It was fixed immediately when we come back ", "After all, we stayed in other resorts eg in Maldives (Gili) before so we would give it a 3.8 rating and if the food selections could enhance then I think it would be 4.5. ", "Thank you again Yumi and everyone!!!", "\n", "\nWe are back to Samabe after for my second visit after 16 months. Staying again in an ocean view villa! The gardens have become greener and even more beautiful, and the staff have made huge strides in their professionalism. Most notably, the food has become even better - with a larger and more tasty menu.", "Despite development everywhere in Bali, the beach has remained private. We had the exact same butler as the last trip, Ibu Ayu, and she has definitely remembered us and it seemed as if she could read our mind. ", "The only difference with this trip was that we used the unlimited privileges program, with massages, body scrubs and day trips included - definitely worth it! Our favorite places outside of our villa were the beach and the lobby bar when Pak Alit was on duty!", "The only negative was that the price has increased from last time\u2026 Despite this, this will definitely not be our last trip, next time we will definitely be bringing our parents to be pampered!\n", "\nWe stayed at the Samabe Bali in early April and couldn't recommend it strongly enough. ", "The Samabe lived up to its reputation, its a truly amazing hotel. The staff were so friendly and helpful (all requests were taken care of pretty much immediately). The pool area is lovely with a view I have never experienced before ", "The beach is private and stunning , you're always guaranteed a sun-bed. The sea is great for swimming , walking and snorkeling . All water-sports are available upon request. Just a great setting for an relaxed beach holiday. Daily only about 6 to 10 couple on the beach , seem most people don t like to walk down the stairs , for us it was a great daily soft work out ", "The breakfast buffet was what you'd expect from a top hotel. Lunch is also very good (although not cheap). Drinks will set you back some money ( next time we do all inclusive) our round of sunset drinks on the beach was generally two pina coladas and a vanilla shake .that will set you back USD 20. In the evening we mostly ate out of the hotel. Whether or not you play golf, it's worth driving the 5 minutes down the hill to the Nusa Dua Golf and having lunch there.....lovely views .", "The quality of the suite 135 square meter was superb with a million dollar view. All soft drinks in the mini-bar. Afternoon tea were free. The rooms have DVD players which play European DVDs. The quality and style of the suite and bathrooms was amazing. The hotel has WiFi throughout.", "The Spa was also lovely, worth treating yourself to a massage (not cheap though). Sauna, steam rooms, areas all free if you are all inclusive.", "In conclusion, the Samabe is not cheap but it is much better value compare to many of the other up-market resort around we stayed over the past 4 years in Bali. This resort will be the first resort we will return too .\n", "\nWe arrived very very late at this resort and there was no bellboy or anyone who helped us with our luggage. We went to the front desk to ask for assistance and she apologised for it and it's understandable since it was really late already. Ayu assisted us for check in and explained everything about the property. Upon reaching our villa, our butler which was also named as Ayu warmly greeted us and tour us around our room. ", "The ocean front pool villa is just so magnificent and the view is breathtaking. We had our breakfast inside our villa and we were so spoiled and treated like royalty. We had american breakfast, pancakes, muesli and cereals. Ayu made sure that everything we needed is all perfectly delivered. We also had the afternoon tea inside the room, although the portions are a bit small it's okay, but the food was not that superb. But their Nasi Goreng and Seafood Platter is excellent. We also went to the private beach, you have to go down 165 steps just to be able to reach it, quite a hike but sunset is marvellous. And the beach was literally empty and very private. ", "Overall, it was a very excellent stay and we will definitely be back soon. Highly recommended!\n", "\nSpent 1 night in one of the suites and wished we had stayed for more. Everything was perfect in every aspect and all well thought of. The room is spacious with breathtaking views. Love the free flow non alcoholic drinks and the vitamin shots for breakfast. Everything about this place is just perfect & magical. All staffs are very friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back.\n", "\nWe decided to book in samabe as our last destination on our 8 day honeymoon trip in bali . The minute we entered the hotel i knew i had made the perfect decision . The check in went in smooth and we were offered welcome drinks . The buggy then took us to our ocean view suite which was outstanding ! We had the all inclusive package which was worth it . We also had our very own private butler who helped us with whatever we needed . Our bathroom was huge with our bathtub having the ocean view . Having the limited package we could eat and drink ( non alcoholic ) at any time of the day . We could do that either in the privacy of our own room , by the pool side or dine in at any of the restaurants . We also had the option of choosing signature activity ( one per day ) and we decided to go in for the body scrub at the spa which was very relaxing and for the second day we went for the 60 minute full body massage which was not bad . As honeymooners we also had the privilege of choosing one honeymoon benefit and we went in for the flower petal bath which was beautifully done . My only recommendation would be to include more vegetarian options . Special and a big thank you to nonika who handled us well ! the other staff at samabe are also truly very kind with everyone greeting us with all smiles :) . I can go on and on about this amazing hotel and will surely return . Thank you samabe for an amazing honeymoon\n", "\nWe needed 8 days of warmth and sun relaxation. Certainly found it at the Samabe . Received a warm welcome at the airport . 25 minutes luxury transfer to the resort, luxury & friendly check in , transfer to our Ocean View Suite by buggy , welcome in front of the suite by a friendly butler who has explained everything to us , unpacks our luggage , get us more drinks and handles our first resort tour. A very relaxing experience from the moment of check in. ", "Our room an Ocean front Samabe Suite was very large and beautifully appointed, the very large marble bathroom was opulent, bath with a view , double basins, mulit spray power shower, 2 separate toilet. We also had a large balcony with seating and coffee table, were able to have friends for drinks and be comfortable. The public areas and gardens ,the pool area was beautiful, with the most comfortable sun loungers and huge parasols and attentive pool butler . The spa and gym also beautiful.", "The breakfast, lunch , dinner , supper all included , very wide selection , we could eat when ever and what ever we like , on day I ask the chef to cook something special for us , outstanding job she did .Soft drinks 24 hours , Starting at 5 pm you also will receive alcoholic beverages , many different cocktails , beer and a limited selection of wines served anywhere we like. ", "Activities included the Devdan Show , a tour to Uluwatu and Tana Lot, massage every day , have never seen this kind of activities in any of the all inclusive resort before. ", "We are a middle aged couple and felt 100% relaxed, the hotel seems mainly cater to honeymooner and couples who celebrate anniversary and weddings , have seen some special weddings function , out of this world .Only 10 minutes drive from the hotel is a golf club and the butler arranges club hire and shuttle.", "This was our first visit to Bali and for sure we plan to come back with friends.\n", "\nwhat a experience. simply no words. best place me and my wife ever stayed. its like a dream vacation of ultimate luxury. we felt like we are vip the way the entire staff treats you. a huge huge spread up resort with the best staff i have come across. ", "we stayed at private pool villa ocean view. its the most ideal place if you are staying with your wife or your girl friend. its like a huge bungalow all on your own. everything is worth praising the room , the bedroom , the bathroom , the pool. simply excellent. the buggy car is always there to ferry you from one place to another.", "if you are interested to stay in the suite rooms then the one facing the sea are the best. you feel total amazed . really i do want to write more but have no words to praise this place.will recommend to all my friends to stay there and have the feeling of the luxury .truly one of the finest in the world.\n", "\nOcean Front Villa", "I booked and paid the top dollar for the ocean front villa at Samabe only because I believed this could provide me a better, if not an unobstructed view of the ocean. The moment I walked into the villa, I had to say that I was pretty disappointed. It was pretty much like the description of property I found in the sales brochure distributed by developer. I had to stand tall and look through all the trees before I could see a tiny view of the ocean. ", "If you are after an ocean view, you had better go for its suites instead, which provide you a very good sea view. I personally found that the design of the hotel was a bit odd given that villas charging much more than suites which should have been built on a better location.", "That said, the villa is very spacious and well appointed. High glass windows provide you sufficient natural light. The living room is big enough for you to enjoy watching TV or simply chit-chatting comfortably.", "The privacy of the villa is not very high as people walk on the pathway from the other side could actually see you if you are in the pool.", "Customer Service", "Most of staff were very polite and attentive. But they were not very organized. While the hotel activities included in my package were confirmed by the email which was sent by the hotel staff before I left for Bali. Upon arrival, the staff greeting me, however, said that I had to pay for those activities. I didn't argue it with her as I wanted to have a laid back holiday and this didn't bother me too much. But the most ironic thing was that the night before I checked out, the restaurant staff asked me why didn't I join any free activities provided by the hotel. ", "The speed of service was pretty slow too. If you are hungry, you had better order your foods at least an hour earlier. The same went for other services you might require from the hotel. Give them at least one hour for everything in advance. Or you will be sorry.", "Wifi", "The wifi reception in the lobby and restaurant was fine. But this was not the same story for the villa. I was so frustrated that I had to keep logining onto the hotel website every 10 minutes or so in order to stay connected with the Internet.", "Hotel Guests", "There were a lot of group tourists at the hotel and they often made a lot of noise during the breakfast time. They also jumped the queue when I was waiting for the buggy back to my villa. I suggest that the management should ask their staff to get those group tourists to queue up for buggy.", "I didn't see them a lot during the afternoon though. You could enjoy some quiet time by the pool as group tourists generally had activities outside the hotel.", "Pool Side Restaurant", "I loved the view and the staff at the pool side restaurant. You could enjoy a quiet evening and watch sunset with a good meal. ", "Location", "The hotel is very far from the main beach and everything. But I personally don't really mind it as this was not my first time to Bali.\n", "\nI had heard a lot about the Samabe\u2019s all inclusive concept before visiting with my wife to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, in March. From the airport pick up till the arrival in this luxury hotel, the meals , the service, the all inclusive activities , the relaxing atmosphere and our special anniversary arrangement , we received everything above expectations. Outstanding!", "I don't think I have ever stayed anywhere that is so dedicated at making you feel that their primary desire is to give you the best service and quality standards you could ever wish for. Nothing is too much trouble for them, and we were constantly surprised at the little things and attentions to details, that makes you think that you are staying at the place that sets the highest standards, making your stay relaxing, special and enjoyable.", "Of course Samabe is not the place to stay if you are travelling on a budget, having said that the level of customer experience and standards delivered never make you feel that the Hotel is either expensive or not 100% worth it.", "We could not fault one single thing during our one week anniversary stay. A Wonderful all inclusive experience!\n", "\nWe (2 adults and 1 child) stayed here for 2 nights in an Ocean View suite."]

It is advice to the travellers that if you don't like resort's food then there is no option nearby as well! We tried to went outside for some romantic place for dinner but it was all in vain. Resort restaurants are quite expensive. Also make sure you are not hiring any cab from Hotel as it is almost twice or thrice the cost available outside. Just walk down 200-300m from resort and you will find can stand from where you can bargain up to 60-70%. Bargain is must in BALI in everything.

The luggage boy was very sorry and asked us to wait in the kids room while they are cleaning the room. But it took one and half hour to clean it and we were very tired after travelling.

The tropical fruits sourced locally are amazing. Jackfruit is my new found favourite fruit, but also the guava, mango and sourstrop are a delight to the tastebuds. We have found that breakfast keeps us going until dinner. The variety of food on offer is good and we have not been disappointed. Servings are sufficient to be satisfying. We are yet to attend the three dance shows/buffet dinners, so we can't comment on those yet, but expect nothing less than excellence!", "The cost of food and drinks in the resort is a little pricey for what we would have expected to pay in Bali.

This resort is one of the first established but still holds its own in both facilities and definitely price compared to some of its rich cousins along the famous Nusa Dua 'millionaires row'. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable and we would recommend getting one overlooking the pool/beach area as this is the heart of the resort. But surely staying in a resort isn't about your room, right? A room is for sleeping and the rest of the resort is for playing! Some great restaurant options, two fantastic pools and a beautiful beach - all a few steps from your bed... that's the beauty of this resort. The staff a wonderful which is the icing on the cake. Our day consisted of feasting on the great breakfast, down to a deck chair at the beach for the wonderful views and a swim at high tide, lunch on the beach or beside the pool, then back to a deck chair at the pool for happy hour (which goes for three hours). Dinner at the resort or venture outside the gates to a place like The Tavern when you're ready or if you care. A highlight of this resort is the wonderful pool bar - does life get more relaxing than sitting on a chair waist deep in water enjoying a beer or cocktail and simply plunging back for a swim to cool off every now and then. We met some great people as well which only enhanced the experience. Spa massages were great and just added to the relaxation factor! Great path along the front of all the resorts allows you to get a little exercise each morning - if you want! We took the Luxury Escapes package and it was great value.

Great open-air common areas, nice room for the money and good overall facilities. Restaurants were a bit pricey, but good quality food overall. Beach was well maintained, but quite a bit of seaweed, so not that great during low tide. Service was good, although I was a bit annoyed that they wanted us to pay for a late checkout; after a one-week stay and a generous tab that we'd run up I think they could have spotted us the room as a general 'thanks'... the place was not booked up. Couple of minor complaints: the pools close down at 7 pm (not sure why) and the concierge was not very helpful in helping use determine restaurants to go to in the surrounding area.\n", "\nThis was a very enjoyable experience. The Nusa Dua area is a tourist precinct that retains a lot of the true Balinese spirit - friendly helpful staff and a truly relaxing ambience. You can as we did, use this as a base for day trips to all parts of the island and then as a welcome respite after travelling through the absolutely chaotic but slow traffic - there are no shot cuts or quick routes to anywhere in Bali ! or you can while away the days poolside and on the beach. There is an excellent spa and exercise centre - air conditioned of course and again the staff are very helpful and friendly.\n", "\nwe stayed for six nights at the end of January in two adjoining rooms , not overly spacious but had enough storage and bathrooms great, pools are lovely with plenty of space and sunbeds ,Breakfast is great with good selection but other restaurants a bit of a disappointment with not a great choice and average quality for the cost, we used the gym and the spa pool also the early morning yoga which was a great experience, Wifi was good around the hotel ", "I was also disappointed in the customer service as we accidently left some things in the room which they said they never found\n", "\nWe booked a family deluxe room which were two inter connecting rooms. very satisfactory for adults and kids.

There were definitely some good points about the hotel, but there were some things that left a lot to be desired.

The pool area was extremely dangerous as the type of stone that surrounds the pool becomes very slippery when it is wet (which is pretty much all the time) and we all slipped on it at different times. The Maguro restaurant was fine the first time we went, but the service and quality of the food the second time was dreadful: my daughter and I could hardly eat one bite of our meal as all is seemed to be was fat, and trying to get the attention of our waiter was near impossible after a couple of Asian families came in.

We like the Balinese design and architecture, the location was fabulous, and the food at Maguro and the Raja perfect.

Shutter doors and glass sliders to veranda which had 2 wooden chairs and a table.

On the whole thought it was a great room.", "3. The resort, yes the resort was built in 1983 and it is showing its age with the stone work and pool tiles etc - some pool tiles in the \"kids\" pool were coming off and in fact I picked one up off the floor of the pool. The kids pool is also good for adults and its nice and shady and also deep. There are very few kids here as it is not aimed at children. The main pool is fantastic, very deep - for a change:)). The tiles above water level need a good clean and I hope now it is the off season, this will be done. The reception and all areas of the resort are very vice and well set out. They are building a new restaurant on the beach front over the next 6 months of the off season but it was little noise and did not worry us. The guests should have been warned about the awful fumes in the hallway from varnish from the renovations to the pool view rooms - it was very bad and I really think the whole area should have been closed off and no one allowed to use the rooms around the renovations. very nauseating. ok once inside the room but walking in the corridor you had to cover your face.

Drink service at the chess bar was incredibly slow waiting for drinks to arrive. The food at the shows (buffet) was not good,very poor in fact - except the desserts which were great. The hot food was dry and awful - a couple things were ok such as the oysters and fish sticks. Pizza and chess bar had great food - our friends went to the chinese restaurant and said it was excellent. Lobby cocktails very nice. The drinks menu at the pool bar was limited, however, the pool bar man \"Machardi\" would make anything you ask for.", "6.

I make special mention of the pool bar attendant, Mr. Machardi and his new \"apprentice\" we called\" smiley\" - Smiley he trained in the restaurant and was fantastic then was promoted to the chess bar but worked with Machardi - he was very proud of his achievement and will go a long way in the years to come.

The hotel offered us the same type of room upstairs - however, we had a GUARANTEED downstairs pool view premier room - as the hotel were refurbishing the other downstairs rooms we could not have what we booked -so they gave us a larger room (club premier room) ground floor but no pool view. They considered this an upgrade. To us it was NOT an upgrade as we did not have the pool view only garden and we were not interested in using club facilities as we wanted to be with our friends for breakfast and evening cocktails not stuck in a room without them. They did not charge us for the pool view room which was fair however it took many phone calls to get to this point as they did not understand that, to us, it was not an upgrade and we were not paying for something we did not get. At the end it was sorted out but took some arguments and back and forth phone calls which were very annoying..... The ground floor was more important to us as I have a knee issue. Not to worry. The hotel sent 2 gifts and a flower arrangement and an apology note which was very nice once it was all sorted.

Although our package was good value and included meals at the resort and spa treatments, we were disappointed a little with the quality of the food. Food wasn't as fresh, ingredients used for omelettes and the like appeared processed, not great quality and the poolside food etc was pretty ordinary tasting yet pricey for what you got. We've stayed in other resorts in the area and found their quality of food much better, tasty and fresh. With small kids as well, the lack of milkshakes with ice-cream or iced chocolates was disappointing. As for everything else, we got good value out of our package, but the overall atmosphere was not as good as it could be, ie, a bit flat. The staff etc were helpful and friendly. The room was clean, but housekeeping could be a bit more thorough in their work. It was 'nice' and the pools were great, having \"kids club\" was handy (although they could be a bit more creative in the activities they offer for boys!).

I will come again.\n", "\nOur entire stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa was a wonderful experience. The hotel itself is beautiful, from the grounds and gardens, pools, beach and the details that have been so carefully attended to like little statues, carvings, ceilings and lamps. The room we were given was also great, looking over the main pool and across to the beach and the service throughout the resort was amazing. The hotel has a lovely beachside restaurant as well as a great breakfast setting and a very nice spa and sports centre (with tennis - a playing partner included, squash, great gym, billiards and table tennis) and offers free photos for couples, sunrise yoga and a great running track (which goes up and down nusa dua past all the hotels). I found this hotel absoloutely perfect to relax, exercise, eat well and to just enjoy Bali. Even not having wifi in rooms was a blessing in disguise as I was able to switch off and enjoy the holiday but then connect at breakfat if I had to. We went in low season which was good - hardly any kids - but this would be a good option at any time.\n", "\nWe stayed 8 nights and had the best holiday. Was better than I could of ever imagined. Staff were fantastic and so friendly they would do anything for you. Would recommend purchasing the packages as it is good value for money. My only negative was the traditional dance shows.

Hope everyone else enjoys this resort\n", "\nPros: lots of them. Very relaxing, quite, yummy, spacious, entertaining. Loved the food carving class. I learnt few easy and engaging ways to feed my kid. The Raja's restaurant was nice. The grill at chess restaurant was definitely interesting.", "Cons: I have been to 2 dances the kechak and legong dance, both of them don't have voice. I really wished I understood what they were doing. They gave a brochure and expected us to remember everything. Most costumes doesn't really depict a character. I advised the announcer lady to tell a sentence of what is going to happen in next 5-10mins every 10mins, which would greatly help our understanding. She didn't seem to want to learn as it was same the next show. Ah don't sit close to the musicians in legong dance, you may lose your hearing abilities.\n", "\nAfter a very long flight, it was very refreshing to come to an beautiful oasis. The staff were especially friendly and so helpful. The gardens are lovely and peaceful. There's such a relaxing atmosphere, you felt as if you at home, but better.

Hopefully, one day will return.\n", "\nApologies for the late write up. Though travel often gets in the way, fond memories fades away but slowly.

Staff were ever so kind, helpful and cheerful, specially, Ade at Raja Restaurant where we had our favourite table and ate delicious meals in the evenings. Birthdays and special celebrations are never forgotten ... so thanks for the beautiful huge birthday cake, flowers and arragement in the room and at Raja's restaurant.

Low value for money!\n", "\nBeautiful place, very friendly and helpful staff. Unfortunately however, our stay did not start well. On arrival our room was not ready and upon inspection proved far too small for 3 adults. Even though this was the room booked through Luxury Escapes the picture on the internet upon booking was far larger. During the course of the afternoon we were offered two more options, both being the same size as the first! We were eventually given a connecting family room for no extra cost which satisfied our needs and made up for the entire day spent waiting for a room. Breakfast every morning was magnificent and had a wide selection from which to choose. However we attended three theme dinners which were sorely lacking. The beach barbeque dinner included overcooked prawns and mussels that were clearly off. The selection at the other two dinners was also disappointing. The food on offer was not reflective of a 5, even 4, star resort. Drinks are also heavily overpriced at this resort. The massage treatments were very good. It's a good resort for total relaxation though not for shopping or mingling with the locals. Kuta is a 200,000 rupiah one way trip by hotel taxi though it's 150,000 if you pay the driver directly! We were also charged for drinks out of the bar fridge we did not consume so be careful of this. Having been to Bali 4 times I wouldn't stay here again though it is a very beautiful place. Have to agree with others that they need to spend money on more maintenance; the pool especially needs a good scrub as there is lots of black mould below the waterline. They need to do much more to claim 5 star status.", "\n", "\nWe recently had an 8 night stay at Nusa dua beach Hotel and were pleasantly surprised with the hotel and the area. While the hotel is starting to show its age in some areas it still is a wonderful place to chill out and pamper yourself. Great pool areas and a wonderful spa retreat. Spacious grounds and plenty of beach frontage gives the feel of a much more intimate hotel. Nusa Dua is a nice escape from the ugly and crass areas around south Bali.Not your immersion into local culture but a a good place to recharge and spoil yourself.\n", "\nWe have just checked out of this hotel and enjoyed every minute here. My husband and I travelled with our 3 teenagers and were given adjacent rooms as we had requested. The rooms were exceptionally clean and although a little tired looking, were still to a very high standard. The breakfast selection is vast with all nationalities, tastes and cultures catered for. We ate at two of the hotel's many restaurants and enjoyed the meals enormously. The staff are definitely what make a stay in this hotel stand out from others we have stayed in as not one staff member in our 9 days there did not smile and greet us or bend over backwards to accommodate anything we needed. A lovely collection of shops and restaurants is a short walk from the hotel but taxi's are so cheap and readily available that you can go further afield with ease. The spa area is a lovely area to relax and unwind with a large variety of treatments and there is also a games room in that area too. Highly recommended for a truly relaxed and pampered holiday.\n", "\nI suggest this hotel everybody. This place, coutry is beautifull. The seaside is very clean.

We loved being part of the Palace Club, the breakfast at the club were great, cooked to order and peaceful location. We did have to show our booking papers to get all of our special deals, most of our main meals were also included this was terrific, certainly worth paying extra for the privledge's. I loved the Cocktails and went to happy hour most nights at the bar, great time with the entertainment and met a lot of lovely people and a lot of Aussies. The Palace Club Ocean View room only has glimpses of the ocean but the room had a separate living and dinning area as well as 2 toilets and a kitchen/storage area and a lovely big long balcony looking over the pond, very nice. The staff were all terrific although it took around 3 days for someone to find me a good pillow. The bed was way too firm for me, so I slept on a down pillow every night. The spa did massages however, my daughter and I need sports type not the fairy finger relaxation massage's on offer. The Resort itself provides some fantastic theme nights with entertainment that were pretty good and it has some beautiful gardens and even the occasional night market stalls, bit pricey but convenient.

Chess Restaurant meals were great quality and highly enjoyed. Pools as always were clean.Free WiFi in common areas only (which is usual for most Bali hotels) was pretty good.

Highly Recommended.\n", "\nBeautiful grounds and excellent service. Staff are a major drawcard especially in the food & beverage outlets. Loved the Spa pool.....keep kids out of their completely for it to be perfect. More quiet and better music required in the massage rooms and the ambiance can be improved. Spas in Bali Collection had the right idea. Staff knowledge and information of the activities around each day need to be improved as well as overall marketing. As a result we missed the garden walk from being told 4 different schedules. Location changes to the theatre dinners were also not provided, we had to walk around to find where to go. Meals at all the outlets were excellent. The only disappointment was Maguro - not up to par with the others. Within close proximity to Bali Collection and local markets. Loved staying here and will definitely choose this hotel for our next stay.\n", "\nWe just spent 7 nights on a family holiday with two teenagers.

At first I thought the resort may have been too big but after a few days we enjoyed walking around. The beach is excellent. Totally clean and no hassle from hawkers. The kids loved the pool areas and we never had a problem getting a seat around the pool. We often preferred to sit at the beach which was very close to the pool area anyway. Service around the pool and restaurants was excellent. My husband got sick one day and the hotel organised a doctor to the room in 30minutes which was great. The only negative would be the buffet theme nights. We found the food bland and disappointing. It would have been good to have a few things at the buffet for the children. Despite this breakfast was excellent and we loved the pizza bar. We loved watching the pond at breakfast. The lizards and water birds were very entertaining. If you are after other options Bali Collection is a 10 minute walk or 3 minute drive. You will find lots of shopping and restaurants here. Easy to get transport from the hotel or find a driver for your stay outside hotel around bali collection. We also loved the walking track that connects all the resorts. We loved jogging along here and up around the park. Kids loved kids club. Lots of activities on offer. Overall the resort is excellent with real Balinese character.

Although being quite large, it felt surprisingly quiet and I had some of the best sleep i've had in ages. The pool area did get quite busy but we always found sun loungers (tip, go down before breakfast and reserve your loungers with the towels supplied - they will still be there as long as you return within a couple of hours). The Breakfasts are really great but the rest of the food became a bit 'samey' after 10 days despite there being a few restaurants on site. We upgraded to the club rooms which was well worth it - the private lounge area was great and the added free afternoon cocktails, and all day soft drinks and snacks made it well worth the extra cost (plus the additional space you get in your room). a couple of other tips - if you want a taxi, don't get it from the hotel, just walk out of the front gates and you will have your pick and can negotiate a price before getting in. Secondly - DO NOT uses airport porters - don't even let them pick up a bag - they will hound you for money and you really wont need their help.

We booked this holiday through Luxury Escapes who every now and then have great deals for this hotel. The hotel has been extensively renovated but still has the wow factor that I remembered. My son 22 walked in and said 'this is a bit too upmarket for me.' Apparently November is a very quiet month in Bali and the hotel was quiet too. Bonus for us as loungers by the pool were easy to get, spa bookings easy and overall staff jumping out of their skin to help us in any way. The staff were great and genuinely lovely.The deluxe rooms are the basic rooms but are pleasant and clean and well air conditioned, which is very important. The breakfasts were awesome in a very nice restaurant with everything you ever want to eat. Really enjoyed the omeletes and fresh tropical juices. We enjoyed the 3 banquet meals at night especially the modern fire dance next to the beach. Heaps of variety on the menu. The only thing we found was that the outdoor venue for the Legong and Kecak dances was too hot. Maybe it was the time of year, or the combination of spicy food and heat. Watch out for whole chillies in the salad, I bit into one and it nearly spoiled my night. Why would you put whole green chilli in salad? The early morning complementary refreshments by the beach was a nice surprise with the staff there especially Dewchtha very friendly. When you stay here try to get up early and see the sunrise and walk along the path connecting all the beautiful hotels. The gardens and surrounds at this hotel were extremely well kept and beautiful. The spa is awesome and entirely relaxing with a lovely pool that is refreshing in the shade. The lobby bar was a nice spot in the evening for cocktails. The swim up pool bar another cool spot for a drink my daughter age 15 enjoyed the fruit punch here. Overall I recommend you go here for a 5 star experience in a grand, sprawling but not too busy hotel with great staff. Found the new toll road a great way to get to see the sights much more quickly than in the past.\n", "\nStayed here for 5 nights and enjoyed every moment of our time. the pool was the cleanest pool I have ever seen.

We ate at the hotel's restaurants a few times and never got disappointed. We used the Spa, the gym and also took yoga classes, all very relaxing and fun.", "My mum had to see a doctor, there is an on-site clinic and they looked after her very well. The next day she got flowers sent up to our room with a lovely card from the hotel manager.", "There are a few bits and pieces that need improvement: on our arrival, the hotel room was not very clean, in particular the floors and also the bathroom could have done with an extra scrub.

The pizza from Sandrino was better of a night than during the day and the light meals from chess very good value at any time. The beach was clean with plenty of lounge chairs for everyone and good service for icy cold drinks. The Spa what can I say only that it was heaven well worth going to this hotel to be pampered and treated like honoured guests We were given tea before and after and we could use the Spa pool which was very private. We would return to this hotel in a heartbeat. The managers and staff should be very proud of what they have achieved at this hotel. A great team from the lowest to the top.\n", "\nMy wife and i had three glorious nights here, rooms were excellent, pool, beach, resturants, the whole expereance very pleasurable.

The grounds are full of beautiful flowers BUT none in the rooms. Mini bar is overpriced so shop in the village for drinks and snacks. Door catches in bathroom and robes did not work and the entire room was a little lacking in lustre. Wi-Fi only works sometimes, which can be frustrating.", "Pool staff generally do nothing all day. and don't bother to tidy around the pool all day, with wet towels lying everywhere and sun lounges all over the place! A bit of direction from management I think is needed here.", "Theme night food is OK but nothing to rave about, atmosphere where the fire dance was held was great and the food was tasty. Thanks to SIOBHAN who helped with my partner and made the night enjoyable for me.", "The Executive Club cocktail food is boring and tasteless compared to our previous stay, but the breakfast and service are great. The food at the Chess restaurant is delicious.", "It was like the food budget had been cut and it showed in the food that was being served.", "The location is close to beach, Bali Collection and the area is lovely.", "We got the impression the Management have lost interest in the Hotel, it just needs its spark back, but in saying that we will return to this hotel.\n", "\nIt's a good Balinese hotel but it's starting to look a bit tired, we have stayed here before and everything was great but this time the air conditioning was not working properly, some meals were not up to standard , and still no wifi in rooms, only in main areas . Staff still excellent and friendly and helpful.\n", "\nThe hotel is lovely, pool area and gardens are beautiful the beach was lovely and clean. The rooms are a good size and the bed is very comfortable. My only complaint would be the cost of food and drinks in all honesty ridiculous a small bottle of water was $4.60 the same price as a soft drink I have stayed in 5* hotels before and never charged this amount. The shop in the hotel sold soft drinks however they were also extremely expensive (they didn't even sell ice creams). When we had the theme dinner at the hotel no water was supplied, we ordered 5 bottles of large water (normal aqua and they were nearly $10 a bottle, It was a shock when we received the bill). The food at the theme dinners was average. Regardless of the exclusive area of Nusa Dua the food needs to be more reasonable. We really enjoyed our stay however if the food and drinks had been a better price we may have eaten at the hotel more. We would get our drinks from the shopping center and bring them back.

Beach was cleaned each day and was very nice.", "During low tides, we would move to one of the main swimming pools, which were always clean and never overcrowded (we stayed 2_9 November, this is also maybe the reason)", "Our daughter enjoyed the Gecho kids club, and loved the kids swimming pool. This is the only remark that I would have, is that next to the children swimming pool; there is no kids\u2019 lounger or a few bean bags. At the kids club, we were always well greeted with a nice smile.

The actual area could do with an upgrade for example better outside activites i.e. pool table and fuse ball were missing parts, kids don't really care though. The toys inside were a bit worn, however it is all overlooked because the staff are fantastic. Especially Edac (Sorry can't spell his name). He made my boys time there so much fun. They still talk about dodge ball and the games they did. The ladies are lovely there also! They even put on a special birthday party for Jacob as he turned 6 while we were there and the hotel gave us a complimentary cake :) Just need to show your passport. They don't advertise so make sure you ask. 24hours ahead. I could go on the free bike tour was great even when you had to pay it was only $15 for 2. The pool was quiet and shady and the activities and balls they had made it not boring.", "The service by the people was so friendly. My only gripe was the price of some of the food was pricey, especially the theme nights when there is a few of us to pay for and the room service was always cold at least 2 of the dishes which I think they should be made aware of as you are still paying top $$ for it. In comparison to Aust it was cheap however we still all go to Bali to save some $$ on a cheaper holiday. ", "The street close by has a heap of great places to eat especially Tropical!

We found the resort to be well maintained with beautiful manicured gardens, an 'oasis like' pool setting and well appointed comfortable rooms. The locale is remote from the hustle and bustle and provides for a relaxing opportunity to recharge your batteries and enjoy the moment. The ready access to the beach with the foreshore walkway made for some enjoyable morning and early evening strolls. This resort and location is ideally suited to the more mature traveller and requires a taxi trip to reach shopping strips or nightclubs. Possibly the only real negative is the quite high prices of the drinks and meals with no real options for a small cheap meal. Also, as with other Bali businesses, always factor in the 'plus (service charge) plus (tax)' on all purchases. Just a little South of the Melia resort is a side street with a small strip of local traders with everything from drinks, to cheap eats and clothing. A longer though very enjoyable walk to the entry of the resort precinct gives you access to convenience and clothing stores as well as several restaurants and bars. I'd advise to include breakfast as part of your package, the breakfast buffet is awesome with many options and cuisines.\n", "\nMy husband and I together with our very good friends are just back from 10 nights holidaying at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort.We all agreed that it is the best hotel for comfort service and ambiance.

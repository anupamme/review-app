1 The food was limited only when you ordered & towards the end of our stay a seperate menu was produced making us feel inferior, the drinks were portrayed incorrectly & not honoured as portrayed in the passport book .

1 I inadvertently lost my book on the second last day & replacing was a huge issue as they couldn't work out what was left & told me all was basically utilised (which I knew was incorrect) however they were adamant.

? I did however end up finding & I still had 5 lunches & 3 dinners left . 

0 There was no apology for the issues & upset our last day .

2 With that aside I would come back but in hindsight would keep a copy of my book each day as proof & get receipts for each transaction.

2 we also had someone inadvertently place purchases to our room but the boys at chess bar picked up, so u really need to check each day on your tab or pay as you go. 

2 Overall though we will likely go back wiser and look forward to another relaxing holiday

3 The service staff of the hotel was very friendly and went all out to help.

2 My spa appointment was booked on the 1st day when I arrived.

2 However, there was some changes to the itinerary that I cant make it to the spa on the 3rd day. 

3 The helpdesk lady was very helpful. 

2 It was near to impossible to change as the 3rd day is a Saturday and the spa booking was full. 

4 However, the spa manager was receptive to accept my idea of having massage in my own hotel room via the helpdesk lady.

4 Kudos to them!

1 One point that the hotel can improve on is perhaps the breakfast menu.
 
1 For the 4 days we stayed, we had the nearly the same international breakfast spread everyday. 
 
1 It would be really fantastic if the menu is varied every other day. Thanks!

4 An absolutely fantastic hotel!!! From the staff to the resort and facilities!! I can not think of a thing to fault and will be back for sure.

4 The restaurant area by the beach is truly lovely and a walk along the path at the beach at night is sure to stir up some romance.

3 Once again like all resorts in Bali I recommend a ground floor room with a pool or beach view after all it's a shame to come all that way and not fully enjoy your time.

3 This was our 3rd trip to Bali and 1st stay at this hotel so we had a measure of what to expect, From the moment you enter the grounds of the hotel with its breath taking Balinese architecture you get a feeling of calm and relaxation.

1 The hotel is a somewhat "tired" in places and in need of refurbishment as it is very 80's in room design and fittings but nonetheless the rooms are clean and functional with a good "wet" bathroom and excellent rain shower.

3 Despite the lush gardens and grassed areas this hotel seemed to have fewer mosquitos than we had previously experienced so they must do a good job in controlling the little blighters!

The public area Wi-Fi was perfectly adequate and in our room was available on the balcony/terrace with enough speed for surfing but probably not enough for streaming videos etc. 

I believe in room wi-fi is chargeable but wasnt necessary for us.I mention this as many previous reviews have been critical of this aspect so I guess it all depends on what you expect in terms of speed and coming from the middle east with low speed internet I can only say we were pleasantly surprised.
 We enjoyed lunches most days at the Chess Bar on the beach and were delighted with the food and service (the black sesame prawns are a must!) As we had learned from previous visits to Bali the bars and restaurants outside of the hotels offer great value and excellent food especially if you want to try the more local food.
 The resort is quite a long walk from the main strip of restaurants in Nusa Dua and you will most likely be advised to take a taxi. You can walk along the beach and get to the main area in 15 minutes or so but the beach promenade is only partly paved and a bit dark at night in places so best to take a torch (hotel supplied in room). We had a few evening meals in the resort however we had a bad experience on every occasion which was probably "the luck of the draw" but these experiences didn't fill us with confidence for eating in the resort. Our concerns were managed adequately by the F & B manager and the GM although when compared to how such matters would be dealt with in Dubai where we live the management reaction was somewhat laid back although this is from our experience to be expected in a private independent hotel rather than a brand resort where collateral brand damage is not at risk. 
Its family friendly although there were only a small number of children at the resort so it was generally quiet especially when compared to some of the other Nusa Dua hotels that are not !
At the time of our visit a lot of daytime construction work spoiled the quiet surroundings as the resort is building a new beach restaurant "Tamarind" which looks like it should be open in August - the noise was a bit of a nuisance but we feel sure once this is complete the bar and beach area will be excellent.
We would definitely return to this hotel again, it is so relaxing and the lovely grounds of the hotel are so well kept whilst retaining their natural charm, it would be a challenge not to relax.

Our family had a great holiday in Bali.
 Nusa Dua Beach Resort had a competitive price. Even though the hotel was kind of old, but was still well maintenance. The rooms were clean, but not fancy. The hotel was big and there were many activities going on everyday. We could stay in the hotel for the whole day and weren't bored at all. The breakfast was included and had a lot of variety to choose from. We asked an extra bed, and there was no extra charge for the bed, only US10 per day for extra breakfast. The restaurants for lunch and dinner, however, were kind of pricey. So we took the free shuttle bus to Bali Collection. Bali Collection was a shopping mall with lots of good restaurants, and it was only 5 minutes away from the hotel. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.
We love this beach resort second year we have stayed there.
 Nusa Dua is a gated peninsular about 30 Mins from Denpasar and Kuta. The staff at this hotel are so helpful and friendly, rooms lovely, grounds are stunning, beach front kept spotless and patrolled by security guards.. The breakfast buffet has everything you could wish for reception staff and concierge service faultless. Beautiful reception area lobby bar and can't wait to go back to see the new beach front restaurant and bar finished. Two large pools one with a swim up to bar. Selection of on-site restaurants and Bali Collection with its bars restaurants and shops is a 5 min cab ride away. Love Bali love this resort hotel.

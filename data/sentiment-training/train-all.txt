2 If you really feel the need to leave this wonderful tranquillity and visit Marrakesh without feeling rushed or stressed, go to the Yves Saint Laurent gardens and Berber Museum followed by lunch at a delightful restaurant a short distance away called Amal.

3 Amal runs a training programme for women from disadvantaged backgrounds. They train women in the restaurant to develop job and life skills in order to transform their lives and become economically and socially stable. That is very worthy, but it is also very pretty, very calm, full of smiles and the food is just delicious and very very reasonably priced!!

2 They would arrange for them to pick you up/take you at other times too, but you had to pay extra for that. It was about 150dhs (which is about 10 pounds) and a little less than a taxi, so for convenience sake a great deal. The journey was about 20mins.

3 Upon arrival in the riad the owners were helpful and friendly.

1 We had booked through a travel agency who had ignored our request for a twin room and booked a double.

3 The owner offered us a big 5 berth room between the two of us unprompted.

3 As many of the other reviews state this is also the owners' home so their children are often running around but we felt safe and welcomed.

1 Con's:Attempted to charge us "city tax" for our children who are all under the age of twelve. The City of Marrakesh exempts young children from "city tax", so we had to show the owner this from the official government website.

1 Room was very cold at night during the month of December.

1 Opted for airport pickup by the hotel (5euros per person).

3 Upon arrival we were welcomed by the host and then taken to the main sitting room where we were given tea.

1 Ended up sitting there for around 30 minutes before the host decided to show us our rooms.

1 She was a bit too pushy about trying to get us to do one of excursions she runs and it was a bit difficult talking to her as she knows very little english (you have to know either french or arabic to communicate properly).

2 Served a typical Moroccan breakfast on our first morning there (croissants, freshly squeezed orange juice, hot milk and coffee).

2 However, the night before we left we asked the host what breakfast would be as we had to leave the hotel by 7.45am.

1 It seemed to us that she was planning on letting us leave without breakfast even though breakfast was included in our booking.

0 The morning we left the host was not the one who saw us off but instead it was her father which gave the impression that the host just wanted our money and didn't really care too much about our experience at the riad at all.

0 It was very difficult to sleep at night at the doors have about a 2inch gap at the bottom so you can hear everything outside your room.

0 All throughout the nice there was constant noise (child screaming, man watching tv, man talking on the phone, two other guests talking ridiculously loud).

3 Despite all this, the hotel is a very good location from the main square (Jemaa el Fna) which requires about a 10-15 minute walk.

0 No key is given either so you have to ring the doorbell and wait every time you want to get back into the hotel.

1 I think the price could have been a bit cheaper but it was an alright experience.

4 My friend and I had a fabulous stay at Riad Chennaoui! We were upgraded from a mulitbed room to a privet one, were served a delicious breakfast every morning and the owners organized a FABULOUS overnight camel treck through the desert for us! The riad even offers airport transfers and I suggest TAKE it! It would have been very hard for us to have found the hotel if we were not shown the way.

1 The cons:- this sort of place is built to stay colder than outside, which is great during the hot season, but not so great during cooler months; they had an AC, unfortunately no remote control or other way to start it- the boilers were unable to provide hot water (or lukewarm at least) for a larger group, that is something that they should really take care of- the breakfast was not too great, the coffee was horrible, and same things every day- it can be noisy, so beware if you're a light sleeper (though wonderfully crazy Marrakesh should cure that for you)Since we were a very large group and the prices were negotiated for us by someone else, I can't really judge the price/quality ratio.

1 LOCATION:Very tricky to find this Riad. You will need a good sense of direction.

2 It is in the heart of an old part of Marrakesh.

2 Jmaa El Fna is a good 15 minutes walk through a very narrow alley lined with many shops.

2 If you are a first time visitor you will most certainly need a taxi from the airport to this Riad. Or better still contact for the Riad to arrange for airport transfer at 150 Dirhams (pounds 12).

0 Myself and my wife had planned to stay for 4 nights over the new year but left after our first night something we have never had to do in many years of international travel.

0 Our room, and indeed much of the hotel smelt of sewage (which can happen in city's with less developed infrastructure what was unacceptable was the denial by staff that this was a problem), there was no working lock on the door to our room (again apparently not a problem!).

0 One to avoid (even if desperate) as there are plenty of far, far better accommodation options in wonderful Marrakech.

0 We ended up in a far more convivial Riad which had friendly staff, a warm atmosphere, was better located and (incidently) cost almost half the price.

2 We stopped off in Marrakech for four days, and, at the suggestion of a friend we met in Casablanca, we went to Riad Chennaoui.

2 We stayed here in Sept 2011 as part of our honeymoon tour of morocco.

2 We wanted somewhere to just freshen up and sleep.

2 We spent all day and night out and about.We got to pick what ever room we wanted.

2 we choose the largest room upstairs, one kingsize bed, with Moroccan sedari/beds used for additional guests.

3 The Shower was really nice and large, the sink was traditional.

3 As for the toilet, moroccans are never any good with designing those things! Was a beautiful room.

3 This suited us fine.

1 We didnt eat in as its much cheaper to eat outside.

2 its about 10min walk through the narrow streets to get to jama al fin'a.

2 Which kicked off at around sunset.

2 Before then its pretty quiet.

3 They have lots of good shops, cheap things if your local or Moroccan.

2 If your a tourist you will be ripped off i am afraid.Its very difficult to visit the country without the language or prior knowladge of the area as people will see pounds  signs when they look at you.Me and my husband came across two english girls who were lost, and looking for the Earth cafe, a worker at a resturant gave them wrong directions on purpose.

3 there was no one up there, very quiet and over looking the city.

3 I would come here again due to location, price and room size.

2 But also open to try another Riad.

3 We went there a couple of times when coming to Marrakech and it is a wonderful riad, not too far away from the centre of the medina.

1 The only downside was the desert excursion the riad recommended, it is sourced to an outside company (Mami tour excursions) so none of their fault really, but the tour was a bit of a disappointment and lacking in many ways.Otherwise, great place.

2 My friend and I (both recent college grads from America) stayed in Riad Chennaoui when we visited Marrakech in February 2011.

4 The riad is really beautiful and the terrace is amazing, with gorgeous views! I booked an 8 person room (I think) and it was actually two different rooms with four beds each.

3 The rooms were really basic but clean and comfortable.

3 The staff at the hostel were all very very friendly and welcoming.

3 The location of the hostel is great as well, just about ten minutes from the main city square.

3 All in all I had a great time at this hostel, it was very clean with an extremely hospitable staff;it was a great experience for a very low price (only like 8 euros per night, I think).

3 I've stayed in a luxury Riad (Julia) and Ive stayed here in one of the cheapest rooms but I would go for this one.

1 Dont get me wrong, the room wasnt very good at all and everyone sharing had to also listen to each other use the toilet with only a curtain inbetween.

3 What makes this riad worthwhile is that its quite close to the Medina and it has a license for alcohol which does come in handy! The communal area is very good with little nooks for privacy but it also has a big TV for catching live football games with fellow travellers.If I went back to Marrakech, I'd come back here but splash out a bit more for a private suite if I was with my partener although with friends then I'd just go for the cheapest again!

1 The medina in Marrakech is a tough place for budget travelers as many riads are very expensive.

2 Riad Chennaoui is a work in progress.

2 We paid 550 MAD for a triple room en suite, not including breakfast.

3 The riad itself is very airy and has a great roofdeck, as well as free wi-fi and cable.

1 Unfortunately when we were there they were ripping up the tile in the center courtyard so there was a lot of mess.

1 Also, like in many budget places in the medina, there is a pervasive sewer gas odor, which may have been worse on the first floor where we stayed.

3 The manager Najeem is very nice and the riad is not in the thick of it but still close enough to Jen El Fnaa.

3 This riad is worth checking out.

0 this riad is in a good location, thats about it.The 'charming' manager sold us a tour that was quoted in Dirham and was changed to Euros on our return, an absolute and complete stitch up ! His mate the driver was also Mr Smooth, we were VERY RIPPED OFF.Very dissapointed and a considerable amount of euros poorer.The hammam on site was a grubby little room for 100dh you couldnt even get up a sweat, local hammam 10dh around the corner.

1 We booked this hotel before reading the reviews and were a little worried about what to expect after we had read what some people had written.

1 On arrival at Les Oliviers, we too were moved to the annex around the corner (which is actually a seperate Riad called Riad Chennaoui).

3 The service on arrival was immediate and excellent.

3 There were three principal members of staff who made our stay incredible.

3 Breakfast was delicious, meals were great and the rooms were very clean and beautiful.

3 I arrived at 09.50 and was already up on their excellent roof top with a glass of white wine by 12.

3 The Swedes fro Sweden arrived at 18.30 and we had a marvellous dinner prepared by the chef at Dar Zelda.

2 My wife and two grown daughters and I stayed three nights at this riad in late December 2014.

3 They arranged pick-up at the airport, and the driver was there, patiently waiting, even though we ended up clearing customs almost two hours late.

2 After a terrifying ride through Marrakech -- I lost count of how many people we almost hit -- we arrived at a location inside the medina beyond which the streets were too narrow to drive.

3 A guy with a pushcart was there to porter our luggage to the door (I over-tipped him with the smallest denomination I had -- 100 dirhams).

2 The alleys leading up to the riad looked pretty sketchy, but we later learned that this is just how the alleys look there.

1 The front of the riad -- like the front of just about everything in the medina -- looked somewhat dilapidated, but.

4 wow, the inside was beautiful.

3 We were met by one of the very nice women who work there.

3 She sat us down in the interior courtyard next to the small plunge pool and brought us the best orange juice we'd ever had.

3 Michele and his assistants were so very gracious throughout our stay, always asking if there was anything we needed.

3 Breakfast was included and was simple but tasty fare.

3 French bread and some sort of delicious fried crepe along with butter and jams and of course more of that delicious OJ.

3 The location of the riad is a little off the beaten path. It's away from the souks so it's very quiet in the evening, but you're only about a five-minute walk from where the stalls are (assuming you figure out which direction to go!) It's about a three minute-walk to the Museum of Marrakech and the Ben Youssef madrassa and about a 15-minute walk to the Jemma el-Fna, which is the main plaza.

1 the two large heaters in the rooms did not work our first night so it was chilly, but they got those swapped out the next day.

2 We wanted a riad that was traditional, authentic and most importantly gay-friendly.

3 And we were pleasantly surprised with all of these points at Riad Dar Zelda.

3 The indoor courtyard was lovely & peaceful, the room was clean and minimalist, the bed very comfortable and the shower nice and refreshing.

3 It was lovely to enjoy this on the roof-top terrace.

3 Wifi in the room worked well, the tv didn't work (but who goes on holiday to watch tv anyway?) and the two female staff were always around the riad should you need anything.The riad isn't located right in the middle of the medina but jemaa el-fnaa square is just a 15-minute walk through the souks (once you find the right route!) A point about the 20 Euro airport transfer: I had read other reviews which mentioned having to pay a 'guide' to walk you to the riad where the car drops you in the medina but this wasn't the case on our trip.

3 Although this is relatively expensive for Morocco I think it's a fair price to pay for the peace of mind.

3 The medina is one big maze and being dropped at the nearest road and trying to navigate to the riad alone would have been a bit of a nightmare.As a gay couple we didn't want any awkward questions about sharing a double bed and this is partly why we chose Dar Zelda and I'm pleased we did.

3 After an hour of queueing at passport control in the airport, the driver did not appear to be frustrated with having to wait for us.

3 Once we arrived near the riad, our taxi man called on another man who then led us to the riad.

1 Unfortunately, you don't really have any other option as you would not find your way to the riad any other way.

2 PLEASE NOTE: have a small amount of dirham for this 'transfer man' (I think 15-30 dirham is the norm, we unfortunately only had big notes so got caught out).

3 Breakfast every morning was fresh and whenever you get up essentially! Room was clean and comfortable, bathroom was very grand in moroccan fashion.

2 As with everywhere in Marrakesh, you are never far from a minaret of a mosque.

3 This was not a big deal for us as we easily went back to sleep in our beautiful rooms.

3 We booked the airport transfer for 15 euros and as expected we were picked up from the airport by a taxi.

1 Disappointingly the taxi did not have any seatbelts (which we found was generally the case in marrakech), the taxi then dropped us off in place moukef and introduced us to a man who he told us would show us the rest of the way to the riad, as the streets are so narrow.

1 Our holiday in Marrakech actually got off to a bad start.

1 After our driver (airport transfer) dropped my wife and I on the main street, we were escorted to the entrance of Dar Zelda by a man whom we thought is a staff.

1 Apparently not as he started demanding 200 dirhams for his 'service'.

2 We quickly rang the doorbell and was let in the riad.

3 Michel (the owner/manager) was around and took care of the situation by paying the man off.

3 The cheese omelet, in particular, was excellent.The riad itself was lovely and has a beautiful lounge area on the ground floor and amazing chill-out/dining area on the roof terrace.What stands out is the service - the staff are very friendly and always greet you with a smile.

3 They also take the initiative to hand us toilet rolls when we put on the "Do not disturb" sign.

3 Laundry and Shisha is free and we appreciate the gesture.

3 We met Aladdin on our last night - a very friendly chap who speaks good English.

2 But the ultimate service gesture was......

4 We actually booked the La Carbone room (99 euro/night) but Michel has SLIENTLY upgraded us to the Kenza Suite (185 euro/night).

3 We only found out about this on our last night when we were comparing our room to the pictures on the Dar Zelda website.

4 We really appreciate the gesture.

4 What really stands out was, unlike other hotels, Michel did not even make a song and dance out of this.

4 He just quietly gave us one of his best rooms!The suite was spacious and have an extra lounge area with a sofa bed.

3 Our room itself has another sofa and was beautiful decorated.The only bummer was there was no wifi in our room.

3 Not a problem especially when you are lazing on the sofa with a glass of wine and smoking shisha!

3 This is a great place to stay.

3 Dar Zelda is very centrally located in the Medina and about a 10 minute walk through the shops to the Big Square

2 The Medina is a maze so it took us two days to realise how centrally located we were, it was fine once we decided to ignore the advice of local people on the streets who claim to be directing you to the big square but actually want you to visit their carpet shop/tannery.

2 Be sure to get the taxi collection from the airport, otherwise the Riad might be hard to find, like I said, the Medina is complex.

3 The room in the Riad was lovely, and well air conditioned, which is much needed in the summer heat.

4 We inquired about the best way to see the Cascades (a waterfall 3 hours away) and instead of just seeing the Cascades, we saw the Cascades, the Arch, experienced a Hammam, saw Aladdins home town, and met and celebrated the end of Ramadan with Aladdins family.

4 This definitely made the trip!I would highly recommend Dar Zelda.

4 Dar Zelda is an absolutely beautiful guesthouse.

4 The photos don't do it justice! We were upgraded on arrival as we were the only guests.

4 The location is excellent - about 2 minutes walk from the souks.

3 The staff were all so accommodating and helpful.

3 The roof-top terrace and plunge pool made the perfect retreat for afternoons when the Marrakesh July heat beat us.

3 The dinner we had at the Riad was really great (if a little more pricey than other local options) but overall Dar Zelda is excellent value for money.

1 It is however difficult to locate so definitely opt for the airport pickup as we would have struggled to find it after our late evening flight.

3 Thanks so much Dar Zelda - we hope to return soon!

4 We had a fabulous stay at Dar zelda.

3 Michel and his staff are extremely pleasant and helpful.

3 The location is perfect if you want to experience being in the middle of the old medina.

3 When you need to retreat from the intense atmosphere in the streets, this Riad has a peaceful, great terrace and spacious rooms.

2 Spent 5 days, headed out to the mountains/coast and then 2 more days.

3 Couldn't have been better.

3 Michel and his team..Tissam, Meryem and Alladin made us feel super welcome.

3 They were great with the kids.

3 Good breakfasts on the terrace, and the food that was cooked in the evening was some of the best we had in Morocco.

4 Having travelled in over 70 countries, no small feet.A fun, great place, with a very warm atmosphere.

4 Michel and his great staff make Dar Zelda a great place to call "home" now for my wife and me.

4 Dar Zelda has so much magic, because not only is it breathtakingly beautifu decorationl(see the new decor done in December 2012), but in the great hospitality of the staff: Alladin; Meryem, Tissam and of course the best host in Marrakech, Michel!

3 Prices were right.

1 we booked one of the rooms but got downgraded to their most basic room upon arrival, which wasn't a pleasant experience, other than that it was a nice place, but the restaurant they recommended was terrible...

3 We stayed a couple of nights (for the second time) together with our two young children and enjoyed it very much again.

3 The whole place is a nicely restored beautifull historical house, generously and tastefully (contemporary French/Moroccan) furnished (also in the rooms!), clean, good location, very helpfull and friendly staff (also English speaking).

3 A private riad/residence, carefully restored with beautiful spacious rooms and a wonderful spacious roof terrace where we spent long warm evenings sipping rose wine and eating olives.

3 The riad is situatied very close to the souk and many good restaurants.

3 We were extremely well taken care of by the very friendly owner couple who made us feel completely at home.

4 This is a trip I will remember for the rest of my life - and I will most definitely return.

4 Cannot recommend this place enough!

4 This Riad is a real gem! Everything, from the stylish antique interiors and spacious, comfortable rooms to the attentive service, exceeded our wildest expectations.It's only a few minutes walk to the Souk (near the Ben Yousef Mosque and the Marrakech Museum), and even closer (100 yards) to our favourite restaurant and bar, Le Fondouk.

3 Above all (no pun intended) we loved the big, cosy roof terrace looking out over the Medina.

3 Here, we drank rose wine and watched the beautiful North African sunset while the muezzin called out the evening prayers.

3 The terrace is separated into different sections, allowing for privacy as well as bigger parties.

3 Breakfast, and an unlimited supply of coffee and water, was available completely free of charge.The charming hosts, Michel and Brandon, who even invited us to lunch with them on our last day, really took care of us throughout our stay and made us feel very much at home.

3 Staying att dar Zelda made our first time in Marrakesh a complete architectural experience.

3 This beautiful private house has been restored in exquisite taste.

3 We were lucky enough to stay in the traditional suite of rooms that combinined traditional arabic grandeur with modern comfort in a way that I won't forget in a hurry.

3 I fact, I don't think I have ever stayed in rooms as beautiful as these, anywhere.

3 The roof terrace with the wiew of the minarets was perfect for breakfast and early evening relaxing after the bustle of the streets.The location, close to the northern part of the Souk was perfect for exploring the medina, The staff very friendly and efficient, and made sure we felt perfectly at home in this beautiful city.

3 Pesonal service from the start, providing a taxi pick up from the airport (for a fee).

3 This car journey is an experience itself - the traffic in Marrakech is manic! As we arrived in the evening, we ate in the hotel the first evening and the food was lovely.We paid for one of the smaller rooms available but it was well sized with a large, comfy bed and very clean.Breakfast was served on the roof terrace which was nicely laid out and very peaceful.

3 We enjoyed returning to the riad about 4pm each day and relaxing on the roof terrace with a bottle of wine and a book before heading out in the evening.

3 All staff were very helpful and polite and went out of their way to ensure an enjoyable stay.

3 This included telephoning restaurants on our behalf to make reservations (Le Foundouk) and actually leading us to the restaurant to avoid getting lost in the winding streets!The Riad is close to a mosque with external speakers and so you will hear clearly the prayer chants (including 4am prayers!) but this is part of the Marrakech experience, isn't it?!!I hope that we will be able to return to Dar Zelda again in the future but at the very least I would definitely recommend this to others.

2 We just come back from Marrakesh where we spent a week.

3 We stayed at the Riad Dar Zelda and had a wonderfull time.

3 The riad is very well situated, 5 min. walk from "la place aux epices" and 10 min. walk from "la place Jemaa El F'na".

3 The owner, Michel, is very frendly and professional like all the employees, many thanks to all of them and especially Mustapha and Nadja who were so kind and helpfull with us.

3 Our room was a junior suite, plenty of space and very good value.

3 I defenitly recommend this place to stay in Marrakesh.

4 We will come back again for sure.

2 Jerome.

3 We had a wonderful stay - the riad is very well appointed and a great value for the price.

4 When I mistakenly paid twice (once on a credit card, once by cash - it was my mistake, not theirs), the manager jumped on his moto to intercept us at our car and return the money when he realized what had happened.

3 There are many riads in Marrakech now and I couldn't compare it to all of them, but we had a lovely few days here and I would return in a minute.

2 Amidst the sights, sounds, and smells of Marrakech's markets and souks, it's easy to become overwhelmed.

2 Even if you're only spending a few days in this pink city, you'll find yourself surrounded by both excitement and (sometimes aggressive) enticement from the vendors and locals that make up the Medina's population.

3 Dar Zelda is a lovely, welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of that excitement.

3 Tucked away on a small path, it's interior is charming and sophisticated.

3 The staff is attentive and accommodating.

3 Throughout our stay, we were treated to lovely balance of European hospitality and local custom.

3 Simple rooftop breakfasts in the morning and mint tea in the evening.

3 They are happy to walk with you to restaurants so you don't get lost in the endless criss-cross of streets, score you a bottle of wine for a night in, launder your clothes, or suggest recommendations for better shopping, nightlife and the like.

3 Marrakech often times felt more like "travel" than "holiday" because of the locals' tendency towards over-embracing it's tourists (to put it gently), but Dar Zelda managed to become the kind of peaceful home base that one needs if they are looking to find relaxation in this vibrant and colorful city.

3 Easy to walk to all places within the Medina and to two amazing restaurants: Founduk and Terrasse des epices.

4 Just a super place to stay in the Medina very near the Souks and the Central Place of Marrakech and with a super great and kind staff ! I do highly recommend such a place for a stay !

2 We stopped at the Dar Zelda for a week between Christmas Day 2009 and New Year's Day 2010.We were picked up at the airport by the Dar Zelda chaffeur and after the initial culture shock of the journey, were met a short walk away from the riad by Nouradine, who offered to help with our bags and offered us a drink and settled us in on arrival.

2 I had heard so many glowing reports from this popular North African country, and as I had travelled in the East and South of the continent I thought I'd give the north a go.

2 Only 3 hours from London I couldn't wait to experience the cultural change of what would usually only be sufficient in flight times to reach Eastern Europe.I was, however, much to the frequent questions and constant frowns from friends and family, travelling alone.

2 I was, however, much to the frequent questions and constant frowns from friends and family, travelling alone.

2 I had done this a few times before and had mixed feelings about it.

2 Yet as most of my friends were obliged to travel with their other halves, especially over Valentines Day, I thought I'd brave it alone and make the adventure for myself! I have always found that when travelling toute seul its best to afford some luxury in case things go really wrong.

3 the cool courtyard provided relief from the heat outside, and I was sat down and instantly given traditional mint tea by its owners, Michel, a charismatic and warm hearted Frenchman, and Brandon, a delightful and welcoming American from South Carolina who to my great relief had efficiently confirmed my booking over the phone in English when I was fretting about how do it in French or even worse Arabic!

3 The rooms are each individually tailored and given their own unique names like Chambre Carbone, and Chambre Afriquaine.

3 Traditional lamps and furniture form the Souks adorn the rooms, and bathrooms in their soapstone features added to the overall feeling that I couldnt have been further away from the my pokey flat in West London.

2 As there was no travelling companion to plan my adventures with I decided to get out there and J.D.I (Just do it!) A haggling person myself I loved sitting In the shops discussing the price of beautiful camel skin bags for at least an hour whilst all the time saying to myself let him agree to my price and not the other way round! Alas, I agreed to his and we shook hands, both with beaming smiles after our cultural exchange.

2 I have often found that lone travellers can quickly be ignored by staff at the accommodation you are staying at.

2 You fade into the background, and at some of the worst places I have stayed you even begin to feel like you're in the way.

3 Not so at Dar Zelda.

3 I was given sound advice when planning my itinerates, and was invited to dine with Michele and his friends whenever possible.

3 When tours were organised for the guests I was asked to join in by Nourdine who had become my constant mentor and comedian of a local guide.

3 took us to the markets and out of the medina to the mountains and even got us into Richard Bransons Riyad to have a look around! The food in Morocco is a wonderful blend of herbs and spices and a pleasant assault to the senses.

3 A vegetable tagine is a must as well as the freshly squeezed orange juice which is served by eager stall vendors in the Jemaa El Fna.

3 At the Riyad, breakfast was served promptly each morning with fresh coffee and croissants.

3 In the evening if you wanted to retreat from the Marrakech madness, dinner was served at whatever time you wanted, no menu required.

3 After 9 days I left feeling refreshed yet sad to leave.

3 I had not only had an amazing time in this colourful and vibrant country but had made some amazing friends.

3 I am now planning my next trip out.

3 Thank you to all at Dar Zelda for making such a memorable experience and making me feel so welcome.

3 Shukran! 

2 A Night at Dar Zelda starts from 69 including breakfast, though prices change according to season.

3 We were met in the medina by the manager Aiden who is British, warm, and extremely helpful.

3 Aiden goes out o his way to make you comfortable, welcome, and is gracious.

3 The hotel is very nice, big rooms and baths, and the staff is second to none.

4 the riad itself is beautiful, clean, infinitely photogenic with sunlight bouncing off of marble floors and whitewashed walls, tastefully accented with local craftsmanship.

1 The only negative point is the access which is a problem is most of the Riads.

2 The Riad Sapphire is within the walled Medina in Marrakech.

2 The Medina like all others is made up of many narrow alleyways.

2 There is a drop-off point to get to the Riad as cars, taxis etc are unable to go through the narrow alleys.

3 The Riad itself is stunning when leaving the noise and heat of the alleyways and entering this beautifully Moroccan styled 'home'.

3 There is a plunge pool to cool off in after the heat of Marrakech.

3 A beautiful courtyard set in marble allows you to relax and this is also one of the places where breakfast can be eaten.

3 What made this truly spectacular was the help from Manager Aidan Webster.

3 He did everything he could to make our stay as stress free as possible.

3 He helped with places to eat, directions through the Medina, places of interest to visit and also arranging a tour to the Atlas Mountains.

4 would recommend this Riad as we had a fantastic time there

2 I stayed here for just one night, and was the only guest.

3 The riad is newly renovated and tastefully done.

3 The rooms are elegant without being over the top.

3 There is a useful plunge pool (it's 45 degrees here at the moment).

4 Service is excellent.

3 Breakfast was lovely.

3 Had a massage in the spa which was one of the best I've had in years.

3 Location is pretty good if a little hard to find.

15 mins to the main square but through the souks so a great walk.

4 Incredible value when you think about it.

3 There are more opulent riads in Marrakech but, at least for me, Sapphire is comfort and service at the perfect level.

3 Would not hesitate to stay here again.

3 This was a lovely find - calm and cool inside and a birds eye view of Marrakech from the roof terrace.

3 Gorgeous, spacious rooms and super clean riad.

3 The breakfasts were absolutely gorgeous, served where and when you wanted.

3 Cool, refreshing pool which was the perfect antidote to the heat of the medina.

3 The staff were utterly charming, friendly and couldn't be more helpful.

3 We were given an umbrella for the rain, advice about anything we asked about, help with directions and just good banter which made us feel so, so welcome.

3 We'd also recommend dinner here.

3 The chef is great and the roof terrace is an extremely atmospheric place to dine.

3 Thanks to all at Riad Sapphire!

3 Arriving in Marrakesh can be a little unnerving for some, but the staff at the Riad made sure that we felt safe and even went for a walk with us to get our bearings, recommending us places to eat and explaining local customs.


3 The Riad is wonderful with a wonderful rooftop terrace and we especially liked that breakfast was served whenever we got up even if that was after midday.

3 Thanks for a wonderful stay.

3 We had a reunion of 7 friends and found the Riad Sapphire a perfect venue -- very comfortable, stylish and well-situated within the old city.

3 The staff were very helpful and accommodating throughout our stay - helping with a guided tour as well as drinks and dinner on the roof terrace as the sun set over Marrakesh.

3 We are here at the moment and being looked after exceptionally well.

3 The staff and facilities are superb.

3 Perfect Setting and breakfast.

3 Even in the searing heat the courtyard is very cool.

3 Had dinner on the rooftop last night under the stars.

4 Fabulous

3 Great riad.

3 Very friendly and accommodating.

3 Always checking we were ok.

3 Room was beautiful and comfortable.

3 Great breakfast too!We got a transfer from them with Mohamed with Mali tours who then drove us to and from Essouira in nice MPV and was super helpful also.

3 great guy and very trustworthy.

2 His number is +212 667994778 but the Raid can put you in touch with him too

3 There are plenty of Riads to choose from in Marrakech but this one was a perfect choice for us.

4 Pristinely clean, beautifully designed rooms, gorgeous rooftop terrace and a large pool in the courtyard (it is LARGE by Riad standards, but small for anyone outside Moroccoit does the trick for a cold plunge).

3 The Riad is located in a quieter, residential part of the northern Medina with easy access into the main paths of the Medina.

3 Breakfast is served every morning and is included as part of your stay.

1 The meal is the same every morning.

3 In addition to crepes or other sweets and freshly pressed orange juice, the cook will make you a simple omelette.

3 While the breakfast is good, the dinner is amazing.

3 We had dinner here once during our stay and the Tagines and Moroccan salads were some of the best we had (and we had a lot of them!)Adrian, the Riad Manager, was accommodating and very helpful in organizing airport transfers and local guides for our first day in Marrakesh.

3 We had a chance to use the Hammam and get massages on site.

3 It is a small space and really is best suited to having a treatment for one.

1 The service could be improved, it was a little disorganized and given the language barriers a little awkward at times since there was confusion over the fact that there were two of us but only one massage room.

3 The Riad itself is amazing value and a perfect home away from home!

3 I was welcomed by the Riad manager, Aidan, who patiently showed me how to navigate the similar streets of the Old Town.

3 The rest of the staff were incredibly friendly and happy to go the extra mile - I am gluten-free and this was easily accommodated for.

3 The Riad itself was beautiful with a very sophisticated decor - in particular on the roof terrace.I definitely recommend!

3 We were only going to be in Marrakech for three days and I wanted the colleague who was traveling with me to experience it all: Moroccan tradition and modernity, comfort and style, easy access to cultural historical sites, and within reach of the meetings that had brought us to Marrakech.

3 Riad Sapphire proved to be an ideal choice.

3 We opted each had a beautiful, well-appointed, immaculately clean room and its own ensuite bath and/or shower.

4 The staff was friendly and helpful to a fault, attentive to every detail of our arrival and stay, and so hospitable we felt like guests in their homes.I'll definitely stay there again and have already recommended it to friends who are travelling from Toronto to Marrakech in June.

4 Absolutely fantastic, could not fault it.

3 So glad we decided to stay here.

4 Completely worth the money.

4 The staff were so friendly and helpful.

3 The riad itself is beautiful.

3 We have already talked about visiting again next year!

4 Having been to Marrakech before and stayed at some equally beautiful riads, I can say with confidence that Riad Sapphire tops the list.

4 I booked this stay for my friends 21st birthday, looking for a relaxing weekend away and it did not disappoint.

2 As two young girls in Marrakech I was slightly apprehensive when booking and reading that there was a short walk to the Riad.

4 This was not an issue at all, the staff were there to ensure whenever we got a taxi to and from the Riad they would arrive to accompany us back to the Riad and vice versa! This service was impeccable, as well as the rest of the service and staff back in the Riad.

4 The Riad itself is beautifully decorated, absolutely spotless, and bears one of the larger roof terraces amongst Riads in Marrakech.

3 The room was beautiful (we stayed in Peridot), and the food we were served on the roof terrace one evening was delicious too.

4 The recommendation to eat at the local Dar Zellij restaurant was fantastic.

4 And the affiliated taxi company to the Riad, with driver Mo made our trip even more enjoyable!  I can speak nothing but incredible things about this riad, and being a young traveller that seeks out new places to stay on every trip I will definitely be breaking tradition for this Riad, and am positive I will return in the near future.

3 Thank you to all the staff for being on hand, both before and during our trip.

4 My family and I have just returned after spending a week at Riad Sapphire , and I cannot speak highly enough of the excellent attention and friendly service which we experienced.

3 3 The manager and all of the staff made sure that all our requirements were met and made our stay memorable.

3 The staff and facilities at Riad Sapphire were wonderful.

3 They met us at the taxi drop-off point, great orientation, and full support throughout the weekend.

3 Supportive all the way through the three days.

3 The Riad is relatively new, and sparkling clean and white.

3 Lovely roof terrace for breakfast or sunsets.

3 Located away from the more touristy areas but still in the old medina with friendly community around.

3 We walked everywhere, and greatly enjoyed the history and culture.

3 Riad staff Aidan organized a half-day medina tour which was excellent.

3 All in all, a wonderful place to stay!

3 Just back from Riad Sapphire.Riad was spotless, our evening meal on arrival even though late at night was truly wonderful.

3 The breakfast was also amazing even made fried eggs for myself.

3 The staff were very welcoming and helpful.

3 We have been to Marrakesh four times and I must say this is the best Riad we have stayed at so far.

3 Only a short walk through the Medina to the square.Thank you to all staff for making our stay one to remember.

3 Great ace relaxed serene and wonderful contrast to hustle bustle of outside.

3 Also beat massage I've ever had.

3 Sweet staff and gorgeous decor.

3 Nice clean fresh simple food too - a good thing in Morrocco!  

3 I loved the traditional interior (painted a fresh white).

3 Beautiful roof terrace, stylish & spotless rooms/bathrooms, excellent plumbing, good food.

3 The staff were friendly, efficient and unintrusive.

3 From before we arrived to when we left, we had a wonderful time at Riad Sapphire.

3 Getting to and from the riad was made so simple with the airport pickup and drop off and having our bags carried from the taxi to the riad.The riad is recently renovated and is very stylishly done.

3 We stayed in the Cinnabar room which was both spacious and comfortable.

3 The public areas of the riad are also very comfortable and homely, including the roof terrace complete with sun loungers.Everyone in the riad was very helpful and informative about Marrakech, from Aidan the manager and Beryl, one of the sister owners, to the staff who worked in the riad.

3 We couldn't have been made to feel more welcome.

3 Providing a mobile phone for use when out and about in Marrakech was a nice touch, making us feel more sure of ourselves where it can be confusing about location in the Medina.My wife had a spa treatment which she found very good though the exfoliation is not for the fainthearted!We love Marrakech and have now found a wonderful oasis in the hubub of the Medina in this wonderful city.

3 I'm sure we will return to Marrakech and when we do Riad Sapphire will be our first choice of where to stay.

3 On arrival my husband & I were welcomed by Beryl & Aidan.

3 We had pre-booked a meal which was delicious.

3 Our room was very clean & comfortable, with an excellent shower.

3 The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

3 Nothing was too much trouble for them.

3 We were given maps to help us get into the town which is a 20 minute walk if you don't take a wrong turn! We had dinner in Le Jardin and Cafe Arabe and we would recommend both restaurants.

3 The food was excellent and the wine was reasonably priced.

3 There are local gardens which are well worth a visit, very tranquil with a beautiful cafe in a lovely courtyard.

3 We are very happy to recommend this Riad.

3 Such a beautiful riad, thoughtfully designed and decorated with a wonderful roof terrace and stunning views of the Atlas Mountains.

3 It's a different experience staying in a riad, much more personal than a hotel and the staff were so friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.

3 They went the extra mile to make sure that I was well looked after.

3 The food was good, both the breakfast and the evening meals were excellent.

3 A great experience, I highly recommend it.

3 My sister and I stayed at Riad Sapphire and had a wonderful time.

3 3 All staff were friendly and helpful and the Riad is beautiful.

3 Restaurants and taxis were booked for us on request and we were accompanied to and from the taxi drop off/pick up at night time.

 3 We were also given a mobile phone that we could have used if we had got lost.

3 All these things enabled us to feel safe and confident enough to explore Marrakech fully.

3 The breakfast was delicious and plentiful and the supper we had on the first night was tasty too.

3 We each had a hammam and massage in their spa, which was both relaxing and a real experience! The location of the riad is excellent, only a short walk from the souks/museums and around 20 minutes to the main square.

3 It is impossible to escape the sound of the call to prayer, but I can honestly say that I was not disturbed in the early morning (I feared I would be as I am a light sleeper) and it was fascinating to watch/listen to from the roof terrace, as the sun went down and all the city lights went on.I extend a big thank you to Barbara and everyone else who made our stay so wonderful.

3 To anyone reading this review, you wont regret booking Riad Sapphire!

3 A delightful riad well located for exploring the medina and souks.

3 Once we had mastered our location - thanks to Aidan's helpful guidance - we were easily able to explore the city on foot.

3 We enjoyed a pre-booked evening meal on arrival and it was delicious.

3 Our room was comfortable, spacious and tastefully furnished.

3 The design of riads all with windows opening centrally mean that the noise level is very dependent upon the other guests; we were lucky and enjoyed real peace and quiet, except for the neighbouring cockerel which did wake us very early each morning (that's medina life for you).We had good weather and found time to relax on the roof terrace one afternoon, gazing over the rooftops of the city and catching glimpses of the snow-topped Atlas mountains.

1 This did not unduly affect our stay, as Aidan was always helpful, but I would say that her lack of warmth may not suit some visitors.

3 I just returned from Marrakech, where my fiance and I stayed at the lovely Riad Sapphire.

3 We highly recommend it! It is run by sisters Barbara and Beryl, and manager Aidan who were all extremely warm, friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.

3 Honestly, it felt like we were staying with family.

3 The rest of the staff there were also delightful.

3 Young Mohammed was wonderful, nothing too much trouble, and we were delighted to find out that his mother cooks in the kitchen, and was the one responsible for the first class food we enjoyed there on a couple of occasions.

3 Probably the best traditional tangines we ate in Marrakech, and we went to some of the best restaurants! On one of the evenings, we had our dinner on the lovely roof terrace, just the two of us under the stars, very romantic.

3 The Riad itself was spotless, and has been recently lovingly and stylishly restored, with hand-carved detailing, and has its own little spa, where we had a thoroughly, exfoliatingly enjoyable Hamam experience together.

3 If ever we return to Marrakech, we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

3 Just what the doctor ordered.

4 Just returned from an excellent Spring Break in Marrakech made all the better by the quality of the Riad Sapphire and Spa.

3 A very well decorated and presented Riad with excellent staff.

3 Everything about the stay was first class.

3 A very nice breakfast was served and all questions were dealt with efficiently and pleasantly.

4 Highly recommended.

3 We were given a very warm welcome by the owner and the manager Aidan.

3 The Riad is excellent value for money, very modern and Aidan and the staff were very helpful throughout our stay.

3 The room was clean and spacious and food served at the Riad was very good.

3 This review is long overdue - we stayed at the Riad Sapphire and Spa for 5 nights in mid-February and it could not have been more special or amazing.

3 We were met from our taxi by Barbara, one of the owners, and she showed us back to the Riad - so helpful for the first time as the tiny streets can be confusing! 

3 Back at the riad Barbara gave us a couple of maps and pointed out the key places to go and recommended a sort of plan.

3 We had some lovely mint tea and Moroccan pastries which just made our arrival perfect! That evening, Aidan walked us down to the main square Jemaa El-Fna which again was invaluable because the little streets and souks are completely confusing until you've done the route a couple of times.

3 These little touches were hugely appreciated.We stayed in the Citrine suite which was beautiful with all the lemon furnishings.

3 Loved the toiletries in the bathroom! The riad itself is so beautiful - very tastefully decorated and very light and airy.

3 The roof terrace was wonderful for whiling away some hours in the sun with a book.

4 We had a wonderful hammam and massage - would highly recommend this for a relaxing experience!We ate dinner at the riad once during our stay but definitely should have eaten in more often - the food was exquisite and it was a lovely, peaceful atmosphere.

3 The riad doesn't serve alcohol but they were more than happy for us to enjoy the wine we had picked up at the supermarket the day before.

3 but they were more than happy for us to enjoy the wine we had picked up at the supermarket the day before

3 Tips for around and about - we had drinks and dinner at Dar Zellij which was beautiful and delicious and two minutes round the corner!

3 Aiden organised a great day trip to the Atlas Mountains for us - very reasonable and completely worth it as the landscape was beautiful.

1 Unfortunately partway through our stay a large group joined the riad and they weren't completely considerate in terms of noise and late night gatherings.

1 The riad is very open plan and noise travels easily, so this group interrupted the peace and tranquility that we had been loving.

3 No fault of the riad, but just something to consider if you are a light sleeper.All in all we could not fault our stay at the riad.

3 Everybody made us feel exceedingly welcome and the little extras like walking us to the medina square were unecesssary but much appreciated.

3 I don't think either of us has experienced service like that before.

4 Please make sure if you are travelling to Marrakech that you don't stay anywhere else! The Riad Sapphire is a very special and beautiful place, and we couldn't have asked for anywhere more perfect.

4 It is an oasis in the busy streets and the staff deserve huge credit for creating such a welcoming and lovely atmosphere.Thank you for a fantastic stay! Chloe and Gareth (Citrine).

4 Im not really sure I can add to all the wonderful comments that have already been said about Riad Sapphire, all the positive reviews are absolutely spot on, but I will try anyway.From the moment we made our booking to our final farewells everything was meticulous.

2 Before our arrival we had several email conversations about our pick up and drop off at the airport, required spa treatments, booking a private guide, lunch requirements and more.

2 We were met at the airport by Mohamed who took us to our drop off point near the Riad as it isnt accessible via car.

3 Aiden (the Manager) came to meet us and was happy to carry our bags for the 5 minute walk to the property.

3 On arrival we were offered refreshments whilst completing the booking in process.We were booked into the Sapphire room which is on the ground floor.

3 3 I believe this is one of the smaller rooms but it certainly didnt feel small and had plenty of space and was decorated beautifully.

3 It was clean, bright and airy, the bed was comfortable and the shower worked well.

3 As we had had a very early start we decided to take it easy on our first day and arranged to have lunch at the Riad, which we did whilst relaxing on the roof terrace in the sun.

3 The food was freshly prepared and delicious.

3 Lunch was then followed by a Hamman by Hanane which was amazing and well worth experiencing.

2 In the evening we ventured out on our own and surprised ourselves by not getting lost!

2 Breakfast was served in the courtyard which consisted of fresh fruit salad, yoghurt, fresh orange juice, omelette of your choice, pancakes, bread, preserves and tea or coffee.

3 all freshly prepared, beautifully presented and very healthy.

3 Whilst staying at Riad Sapphire we both also had a full hour long body massage which was really relaxing and far better value than any spa treatments that you get in the UK.

3 Barbara (the owner), was often around, along with Aiden and they were always more than happy to advise or help as were all the staff who were always smiling.

3 Nothing was too much trouble.

3 On request prior to our arrival the team arranged for us to have a half days private guide Ouidat, who was incredible and helped make our stay informative and enjoyable.

3 We would thoroughly recommend having a guide if this is your first visit and want to really feel this vibrant, crazy city.

3 Barbara and Aiden recommend (and booked) for us to eat at Dar Zellij for our Anniversary meal on our last night, it was a perfect choice to end a wonderful special celebratory weekend.

3 We would like to thank Barbara, Aiden and the whole Riad Sapphire team for going the extra mile in helping make our weekend in Marrakech a truly unforgettable experience.

3 Thank you also for the beautiful flowers that were in our room to celebrate our anniversary.

4 We look forward to our next visit to Marrakech and stay at Riad Sapphire and will definitely be recommending you.

4 Very rarely have I stayed in a hotel where the reviews I've read prior to going actually lived up to the hype.

4 My first visit to Marrakech was truly an amazing experience and our stay at the riad played a large part in that.

4 Tucked away in what at first seemed like the middle of nowhere is this hidden gem and rather stunning, modern riad.

4 Straightaway you feel at home.

3 The team there are lovely and very welcoming.

4 All the food is home cooked and absolutely delicious (generous African portions).

3 We stayed in the Amber room, a decent sized airy space with a sun roof which was very relaxing.

3 Loved the toiletries, deliciously scented.

4 The roof terrace had stunning views overlooking the Medina, with the Atlas Mountains in the background.

3 If you wanted to you could ask to have your breakfast up there.

3 We enjoyed a Hammam and full body massage at the spa, which we booked as part of their winter spa package deal.

3 As two people who live very busy hectic lives this was just the relaxing break we needed.

3 Great place to unwind especially after taking on the hustle and bustle of the medina and souks.

3 We couldn't have asked for anything else from Aiden and the team.

3 They were all very helpful at giving you information on the surrounding area.

3 If you've never visited Marrakech before, I would recommend booking the local tour guide, which you can do through Aiden (very informative and a great way to get your bearings).

4 Highly recommend.

3 A truely pleasant stay.

3 We really felt that we had fallen on our feet after picking this riad from a large number on the Internet.

4 We enjoyed our stay enormously - everything from the warm welcome with mint tea and Moroccan pastries to our final meal when our table was set by the fire and the candles lit.

4 Perfect! Both Barbara and Aidan were very helpful as were the other staff.

3 Nothing seemed to be too much trouble yet the help was not intrusive and the atmosphere was relaxed.Our room was comfortable, the shower was hot and water plentiful and there were some good toiletries.

3 I particularly liked the rose-scented soap! 

3 It was also very nice to have heating in the room when we required it as the later evenings and first thing in the mornings can be cool in February.

3 Delighted with the food too - the cutlery/crockery was always sparkling- good breakfasts with fresh orange juice, fruit salad, crepes, omelettes etc.

3 And some delicious coffee to start the day.

3 We stayed in for a couple of dinners by ordering in the morning and having it freshly cooked just for us.

4 What luxury! I can recommend the soup, the beautiful salads, the chicken with preserved lemons and olives, and the chocolate pudding...so thanks to the excellent cook.

3 We spent a few afternoons on the roof terrace where there are sun beds and a nice seating area - the perfect spot to relax and read with views of the distant snowy Atlas Mtns.We did wonder, when we booked, if the riad was a little too far north but this turned out not to be the case.

3 It became easy to find our way to the main square with only a few wrong turnings to start with.

3 It was a blessing to be in a quiet area a little way from the frenetic souks.

3 I would recommend a massage in the riad too for complete relaxation- we had the works!We very much enjoyed our stay in Marrakech which was in no small part due to the Sapphire Riad.

3 As the title says "an absolute delight"!

3 My second visit to Marrakech, both times in Riads owned by the same propritaire.

3 A warm welcome makes you feel at home straight away.

3 3 All the staff are very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble.

3 I ate very well, always plenty of choice as long as you ordered in the morning, as every thing is cooked fresh.

3 Rooms are all on suite, very clean and comfortable.

3 Trips outside of Marrakech can all be arranged via Aiden the Riad Sapphire manager.

3 Whether you want to bargan in the souks or just relax with a mint tea, you are in easy walking distance.

3 We have just visited Marrakech for the first time and it was one of our best ever trips.

3 I have to say that the Riad Sapphire had a lot to do with that! They made it all SO easy.

3 Barbara and Aidan gave us all the information we needed.

3 3They arranged airport pick-up, gave us a cell phone in case we needed to contact them, advised on the sites to visit and how to get to them, and managed to find a driver who was able to drive us through the Atlas Mountains and back without my feeling travel sick at all.

3 And the staff were wonderful.

3 They were so helpful, from taking us to the main square to even cooking a special cake for my allergic husband.

3 The Riad itself is not only spotlessly clean and comfortable, it is absolutely beautiful.

3 Just a pleasure to stay in.

3 Honestly, we have visited many places and this trip is one of the best thanks to the Sapphire.

4 I can't recommend it strongly enough.

3 Found the Riad Sapphire on Trip Advisor after some other favorites (at twice the price) were fully booked.

4 And, wow, did we luck out! We were a professional design team (two women) traveling on business, picky about our B & Bs, our food, our location, etc.

4 Riad Sapphire did not disappoint during a six night stay in February.

3 The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, always available, but not intrusive.

2 The spa hamman and massages became a nightly ritual.

3 The gourmet meals cooked for us and served in front of a warm fire in the den were preferable to even the best restaurants we frequented.

3 Initially we felt far from the center of the souks, but once we realized it was easier than we thought to find our way, we were actually glad to be in a more quiet location.

3 the interior decor was a soothing white with a dash of color and curated art & objets.

3 There is really nothing quite like a devoted British host.

3 Barbara was very professional, but also as accessible as an old school chum.

3 Aidan, the new maitre d'hotel, was the Energizer Bunny himself, popping up just when needed.

3 Mohammed cheerfully accompanied us in and out of the winding alleys whenever we requested his guidance.

4 The beds were excellent, duvets plentiful, the electric heaters in the rooms were new and efficient, and I lust for whatever the shampoo was that was stocked in the bathrooms.

3 A big thanks to all for making a working visit more like a vacation.

3 Authentic Riad but very clean and comfortable, Felt at home staight away.

3 Staff very friendly and helpful.

3 Locals also friendly.

3 Owner gives you plenty of advice on where to go, what to do and what not to do.

3 The Trip was a Last Minute decision with no planning in advance but luckily we stayed at Riad Sapphire.

3 Barbara gave us ecxellent advice and support and she also arranged a one day trip for us when we wanted to see more of Moroc.

3 It was just a perfect stay.

3 We stayed in this riad for 4 nights in January 2015 and the stay was absolutely amazing.

3 We wanted to stay in a riad to get the most out of our stay in Marrakech, and that I recommend everyone to do when you come to Marrakech, you won't miss the big hotels at all.

3 As there are many riads in Marrakech, using tripadvisor I had a hard time selecting the perfect one.

3 So I had to google around and found this luxury boutique riad, and yes it was perfect.

3 We booked the stay from their official webpage, and I do recommend that as the prices are cheaper and also you can book airport transfer and meal on arrival.We booked the airport transfer, and i do recommend that because it can be difficult to find the way to the riad.

2 We booked the airport transfer, and
1 i do recommend that because it can be difficult to find the way to the riad.

3 We were picked up from the airport by a very friendly driver who drove us to the medina.

3 In the medina Barbara, one of the owners of the riad, was waiting for us, she welcomed us and then guided us to the riad which was about 4-5 min walk from the parking.

3 The first walk to the riad was truly an awesome experience and then to walk into the beautiful riad was even more astonishing.

3 We were welcomed by the staff and served fresh mint tea.

3 We were given information abput the riad and map over the city.

3 We were also offered a cellphone with local number for 100 dr deposit, we could use the cell for emergency use, like if we got lost in the medina etc.

3 We felt extra safe by carrying the cell with us around.

3 Barbara and the staff of the Riad Sapphire were really nice and always helpfull.

3 They all took really good care of us.

3 We were given a complimentary room upgrade upon arrival, and from there everything just got better and better.

3 The whole riad is super clean and so well-decorated.

3 Nice details all over and a lovley roof terrace with 360 degrees view of the red city.

3 We had freshly prepared breakfast every day, so lovley.

3 The location was perfect for exploring the Medina, and it took us about 20-25 min walk to the main square.

3 There is plenty to see on the way to the square and we enjoyed our daily walks.

3 The riad is loacted away from the busy and noisy areas of the medina, but still being close enough for exploring by foot.

3 We appreciated this alot and felt we could relax in peaceful enviroment after a busy day.

3 We want to thank everyone at Riad Sapphire for making our trip to Marrakech so memorable, and we can highly recommend this riad to everyone and will surley go back.

3 My daughters and I just returned from a two week trip to Morocco over Christmas and luckily, by pure chance found the Riad Sapphire in Marrakech on line.

3 What a hidden gem this Riad is.

3 The owners Barbara and Beryl made sure that our every need was taken care of, from airport transfers, helping with the retrieval of lost baggage, being met by Muhammed who guided us back to the hotel and was on hand for all sorts of requests.

3 They even purchased bus tickets for our on-going travel while we were away on a camel trek.

4 This Riad is a wonderful place to stay: it is beautiful, the rooms are just delightful, the food prepared by the amazing Fatima was delicious, and impeccable service from all the other members of the staff.

3 They were always smiling, even during a random power cut during dinner one night.

3 Nothing fazed them.

3 We were given a cell phone on our arrival, during our welcome chat, and told to use it if we got lost and needed rescuing or help in any way.

3 So comforting, because the little streets are very easy to get lost in.

3 I cannot recommend this place highly enough, it set a very, very high standard for the rest of our trip, and was by far the best place we stayed.

4 I have never written a review before, but I wanted to following my stay here!Staying at the Sapphire Hotel and Spa was the best decision that we made when travelling to Marrakech.

4 We have just arrived back after spending 4 nights there, and we already miss it.

4 The location is excellent; a short walk to the markets and close to the taxis.

3 An airport transfer was arranged from the airport to the Riad, which was extremely useful as it would be easy to get lost otherwise! It is a hidden jewel amongst the streets, one that would not expect to find until you step inside.

3 It has been decorated beautifully.

3 We stayed in the Topaz suite which features a four poster bed and an extraordinary dome ceiling.

3 Upon arrival, you are treated with mint tea and moroccan pastries, and are told key facts about the city; places to go and visit, to eat and given useful tips and hints about the local area.

3 We were given a phone with numbers for the Riad, to use if we got lost.

3 We also received maps and key attractions were pointed out.

3 On our first outing, Muhammad was kind enough to be our guide and show us the way to the main square.

3 By the end of the day we felt like we knew the area well and I am glad to say that we didn't need to use the phone during our stay.Breakfast is delicious, served by a talented cook and attentive staff.

3 The ingredients used are fresh and bought locally.

3 Being someone who doesn't usually eat breakfast, it was my favourite meal of the day in Marrakech! We would also definitely recommend having dinner at Riad Sapphire at least once during your stay.

3 Make sure you set some time aside for the spa; Hanan is brilliant and we enjoyed the massages and facials.This is a beautiful and relaxing Riad, where nothing is too much trouble.

3 They go the extra mile to ensure the trip is perfect.

3 We would specifically like to thank Muhammad, Barbara and Beryl, who looked after us during our stay and made it one to remember.

3 Myself and my family stopped here for 4 nights over the New Year period.Everything was absolutely first class from the pre-arrival communication to the wonderful service throughout our stay.

3 The Moroccan staff led admirably by Fatima were just fantastic and look after our every need with an constant smile, in fact they made a stay in the wonderful City that is Marrakesh!
3 Breakfasts and the evening meals we had at the Raid were of the same very high quality.The tastefully decorated Riad had a lovely fresh feel and the roof terrace afforded a superb place to soak up the sun (yes - even at this time of year).Honestly we couldn't have stopped in a better place.

3 We travelled to Marrakech for Christmas, and found the Riad Sapphire by chance online.

3 It was meant to be.

3 Beverly and Barbara took so much care and attention to make our stay in Marrakech hassle free and memorable, from their online blog and emails before we left to being greeted from our taxi and the chat over mint tea on arrival.

3 We were even given a mobile phone to contact them during our stay should we need it (which we didn't, thanks to all their advice).

3 The Riad is elegantly renovated and our room (Topaz) was calm and beautiful.

3 The staff were warm and friendly, and the cook prepared delicious breakfasts and meals.

3 We enjoyed an authentic professional hammam on site and a relaxing massage.

3 If a friendly, convivial and relaxing atmosphere in the old Medina is what you're after, I would recommend this Riad.

3 We immersed ourselves in the city and walked everywhere, but there is a taxi drop-off only a few minutes away.

3 Our experience of Marrakech was undoubtably enhanced by staying at the Riad Sapphire and Spa.

3 I would like to say how much of a great and relaxing time we had at the Riad Sapphire in Marrakech, the Riad was lovely and so peaceful and just what we was looking for, as we were looking for a relaxing break for me, my sister, my brother and my mum, as we thought we would take my mum away for her birthday.

4 I would say the service was excellent, all the staff were very friendly and helpful, Yvonne who was in charge of the Riad was very helpful, she had a great knowledge of the local area, and told us exactly what to look out for and recommended some great places, her and her lovely team made our break very relaxed and comfortable, I would say this place is ideal for family breaks, couples or even friends, as the location is great and the Riad itself is beautiful.

4 Thanks again to Yvonne and the team, would definitely come back!!

2 A group of us 'took over' this riad in the quieter Marrakesh.

3 The rooms were spacious, the roof terrace a brilliant place to chill out and get the late November sun, the lounge was also a good chill out space.

3 The service staff of the hotel was very friendly and went all out to help.

1 One point that the hotel can improve on is perhaps the breakfast menu.
 
1 For the 4 days we stayed, we had the nearly the same international breakfast spread everyday.

2 I believe in room wi-fi is chargeable but wasnt necessary for us. I mention this as many previous reviews have been critical of this aspect so I guess it all depends on what you expect in terms of speed and coming from the middle east with low speed internet I can only say we were pleasantly surprised.

4 We enjoyed lunches most days at the Chess Bar on the beach and were delighted with the food and service (the black sesame prawns are a must!) As we had learned from previous visits to Bali the bars and restaurants outside of the hotels offer great value and excellent food especially if you want to try the more local food.

1 We had a few evening meals in the resort however we had a bad experience on every occasion which was probably "the luck of the draw" but these experiences didn't fill us with confidence for eating in the resort.

1 At the time of our visit a lot of daytime construction work spoiled the quiet surroundings as the resort is building a new beach restaurant "Tamarind" which looks like it should be open in August - the noise was a bit of a nuisance but we feel sure once this is complete the bar and beach area will be excellent.

3 As with anywhere in Nusa Dua, the ready availability of everything you need means you may start to get cabin fever after a few days, however taxis are waiting right outside the hotel doors, and day trips to Uluwatu, Ubud etc help break this cycle.

1 Witnessed a couple of instances of disputes between guests over sun lounges around the pools which I think would be easily remedied by maybe getting some hour glass sand timers or something like that so you had only a 1 hour window to leave your chairs unattended so someone else could use them.

1 A few more chairs under the trees would help as well as not everyone needs to be right next to the pools.

3 This resort retains a lot of Balinese heritage and charm compared to many of the newer more "Americanised" venues that surround it so it depends on what you are looking for on your holiday as to weather this is the place for you or not but we think things like the large Lizards wandering around the dining area, squirrels on the room balconies and the wonderful local staff make this hotel our first choice when we return.

2 From what I can make out from other reviews, there seems to be quite a difference in quality between the basic 'Deluxe' rooms, and the better 'Premier' rooms. 
 
4 We stayed in a Premier room in the west Agung Garden wing of the hotel, overlooking the garden and small lake- it was truly a joy to awake to the sounds and sights of tropical birds, cheeky squirrels, other wildlife and the fountain in the lake.

1 The one disadvantage of staying in the Nusa Dua area is that, being a gated 'enclave', local dining options are limited to either your hotel, neighbouring hotels, or the Bali Collection mall.

1 Afterall it was a good experience but I believe it could be better 
flies at sushi section of breakfast , need to cover the food

The bathroom smell was awful

2 Prepare to pay high prices for all items within the hotel - this is expected in a 5 Star Hotel and we didnt mind The Bali Collection is 10minutes walk from the hotel (half the price) and the town itself is 15minutes walk from the hotel (cheaper again)

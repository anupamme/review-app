3 I always stay at Blue Hotel when travelling to Sydney. The location is fantastic, fine dining restaurants below, pubs across the road for more relaxed dining. Lovely views of the boats and the city and pack your runners for a walk or run around to Opera House. The renovation has improved what was already a fabulous hotel

3 My husband and I recently stayed here to celebrate our anniversary and were so happy with the amazing welcome and phenomenal hospitality from the Blue staff Stuart, one of the managers was particularly lovely and really went above and beyond to make our night really special; even making reservations for us at the restaurants downstairs to make our night a little smoother

3 My boyfriend and I stayed at the Blue Hotel a few weeks ago and had a fantasic stay We both live and work in Sydney but like to have hotel dates from time to time The location is unbeatable - one of the most beautiful spots in Sydney (Tip - go for a stroll through the Domain or the Botanic Gardens the next day)

Thank you guys for being a professional hotel but also a little bit different - you set yourselves apart from the other players in the game

4 This fabulous heritage listed building has the WOW factor all whilst maintaining its original character and cultureI recently stayed in Sydney for a special occasion and having traveled from the Gold coast (which I do frequently), I decided to see what Woolloomooloo Wharf had to offer instead of staying in the heart of the CBD

1 When I booked this visit some months ago, no mention was made of the fact that the interior of this hotel was being gutted. 

1 Two days before arrival I was informed that some facilities might not be available On arrival the absence of a reception desk in the hotel tipped me off that something was up However, the hotel came to the party by providing in the room a so called "Noise Survival Kit" This contained a pair of earplugs-one each for my wife and I

2 The receptionist explained that information about the refurbishment works was on the website On checking this I discovered that "the noisiest of works taking place from 10am to 5pm" When toe building began to rock at 0830, I assumed that this was an earth tremor However, the survival kit contained a pre-opened miniature of Bacardi rum to deal with this issue

1 We were not disturbed by the room cleaners until after 500pm. This was irritating since the lack of any hotel foyer forced us to remain in the room, particularly in the wet weather

3 I had initially wanted to stay at Blue’s sister hotel but it wasn’t available on my travel dates, so I went with Blue and couldn’t be happier with my decision For the same nightly rate, you get much more room and a better location at Blue By location, I mean easy access to the Opera House, Circular Quay (ferries to Taronga Zoo) and Harbor Bridge, cabs lined up on the curbside, a nice walk via Victoria St to Kings Cross train station (beautiful houses with Victorian-era terraces on Victoria St), and a quiet neighborhood on the waterfront

3 On my last day I wasn't flying out until late evening, and as I was going to Bondi during the day I asked if it was possible to take a shower before collecting my luggage and leaving for the airport, the reception staff were more than happy to let me use the changing rooms by the swimming pool and provided me with towels, shower gel, etc and so were very accommodating

3 Currently undergoing renovations but this was not intrusive No ferry from wharf but good bus service or easy walk through gardens to city once you find the overpass About $15 by taxiWe went there last August 2015 during my birthday The staff gave us a champagne, wow, that was a first as opposed to a cliche birthday cake

3 The hotel itself was really unique, I hope they won't change the look-and-feel that much The room view was not that bad, facing a bunch of navy ships, but I was hoping to have a harbour view with the city as the background I know it was still under renovation. My only gripe is the location of the pool, you have to literally walk along the hallway to reach it I hope this was just temporary because of the renovation that has been going on

3 When we arrived we were a bit disappointed because we booked through the wotif mystery deal we ended up in a twin room, which wasn't ideal for my partner and myself They were too full to move us on the first night, but they moved us on our second night to an amazing and huge room with water views and city views

3 We stayed in a "luxury marina loft" which has the living room on 1st level and the bed and shower facilities in the loft 

3 There is no way we are able to carry out luggage up to the loft as the stairs are narrow and there is limited space on the loft which is impractical as one needs to shower upstairs and dress downstairs However, what we both like is the skylight as we are able to look at Sydney skyline during the evenings Overall, it's a nice hotel despite the impractical layout of the luxury marina loft

Nothing was a hassle and assisted in making bookings for restaurants on the wharf Stunning location, clean rooms, added bonus of valet parking, close to the city and all in an unique building Enjoyed the room service and yummy breakfast Would not hesitate to stay here again Thank you to the team at Blue

3 I have stayed at Blue Hotel a few times now, mostly for business (but really for pleasure)The rooms, food, position, views and beds are all top notch, but it's the service that keeps us as a company coming back The people managing Blue Hotel clearly understand the importance of happy staff for happy customers

3 There was a bottle of champagne and some goodies waiting for us as the hotel knew I was celebrating a birthday - this was a really nice touch The hotel manager even helped us negotiate a great price for dinner on the wharf Great location if you would prefer to be slightly out of the hustle of the CBD but close enough to walk right back in World class restaurants right outside the front door all the way along the wharf We are really looking forward to going back once all the work has completed, it is going to be amazing

A fun experiencenot inexpensivebut worth every Australian dollarThe staff of the Hotel were lovely and courteous The room was lovely however the position of the room was not so good I did request when I booked not to be near a road and was assured that I would not be placed near the road However when we arrived on Thursday evening the room we had been given was at the front of the hotel overlooking the road the noise to the room was extremely loud was woken up all 3 nights with people yelling and carrying on outside the front of the hotel and was unable to get back to sleep :( I would stay here again if I could be guaranteed not to be near the road and be further down the side of the hotel The reason I chose this hotel was because of the close proximity to the functions we were attending apart from the badly positioned room everything else was goodI will try this hotel again and hopefully my experience will be a better one

The Blue Sydney hotel in Sydney is an excellent option It has a great atmosphere, excellent service and the room is very comfortable It has great restaurants in the same location of the hotel, like an excellent chinese 

The hotel staff is very prestative and efficientI stayed here 9 years ago when the facility was under different management and loved it then, returned for the location steps from the Botanic Gardens Close to gardens and shops for me, and close to good, cheap eats for my 18 year old son I can happily report that the hotel has only improved with time 

Large room, clean, well appointed I love the large, soaking tub and the kettle with nice assortment of teas Attentive, helpful staff

Stayed here for our first wedding anniversary Great loft apartment style room with city views Location is fantastic easily walk to Botanic Gardens and Opera House etc but the other direction is Potts Point and heaps of great coffee and restaurants We dined at China Doll which is also in Finger Wharf Brilliant meal see other review 

Rooms very comfortable and staff friendly Pool area also niceStayed here for a night while travelling through Sydney 

The hotel was very nice, conveniently located, easy stroll to either Circular Quay or the city shopping precinct 

Upon arrival, valet parking was quick and easy Reasonably priced You'd be mad not to use this option if travelling in your own vehicle Staff at the front desk were great, pleasant and easy to deal with 

3 Room was nice and spacious Bed was comfortable and clean Bathroom was a good size The view from the balcony was beautiful Restaurants below this hotel are some of the best in the city Would recommend to others looking for a romantic weekend getaway

1 The hotel is located at Wooloomoolloo Bay on Cowper Wharf Road in walking distance to the Royal Botanical Garden The location itself is a bit remote with no nearby public transport such subway etc You can take walk through the garden to the Opera house which is very nice (beware the closing times of the park in the evening)

3 You can take walk through the garden to the Opera house which is very nice (beware the closing times of the park in the evening) 

The building is a remodeled wharf with an industrial design Its combination of hotel and private apartments The idea of wharf as hotel is splendid and lobby is nicely designed 

The breakfast room (breakfast is good) is on the ground floor of the wharf Openly designed and very nice However, when the outside temperature is low, the wharf inside cools down too So it can be pretty cool during breakfast (in winter) However, the rooms and its furniture are old and run down and not worth a 4-5 star hotel at all (and we have been to many) We've complained about it and received an upgrade However, that didn't make it nicer 

The interior design is just not up-to-date The comment from management (very friendly) was, that they will remodel the place in September This didn't help either - a discount to match value for money would have been nicer

 We have tried to rent their bikes, which they offer for free The bikes were not up to the safety standards ( breaks did not work) and not in good shape For this we received free breakfast Overall, as most hotels in Sydney (even Australia) you do not get value for money 

Unless, it receives a major upgrade I would not spend that much money for room anymoreWe decided to treat ourselves with a night in this hotel 

The loft room is great, clean and with all the comforts The heater downstairs wasn't working properly, the temperature difference between the two levels was a bit uncomfortable The pool is heated and the jacuzzi very relaxing Staff is friendly One only negative thing: for that price we were expecting free wifi and breakfast included - nope

I was looking for somewhere to stay in Sydney before leaving for an overseas holiday I decided on the Blue Hotel From the time that I made the booking until my departure 10 days later I had made the right choice The staff were polite - always smiling and most obliging with any request The most perfect location to the best restaurant in Sydney Opera House - Conservatorium - Art Gallery plus the most amazing harbour walk and beautiful gardens I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the Perfect Hotel to stay at in Sydney  Apparently the hotel will have a new name shortly OVERTOThank you everyone at BLUE

3 I've stayed at the Blue a number of times and love it Right on the water and a very quick taxi ride to downtown There's a "meat pie" truck parked just down the street which has the best meat and pea pie (you have to try it ) ever King's Cross is just a stone's throw away if you're up for a night out and the Botanical Garden is walking distance with all manner of flower and critter There are also a number of awesome restaurants connected to the property so finding a place to eat or drink should not be a problem It's my go-to hotel whenever I'm in Sydney

3 Overall the Blue is a unique hotel with a lot of charm in an interesting area Unfortunately they're under renovation right now (until end of September), and that negatively affected the experience I didn’t hear noise while sleeping, but did find it annoying while leaving the hotel both days The "noise survival kit" was cute, but not replenished like they said it would be

3 Sockets: Tons 6 on one side of the bed, 2 on the other 

I charged everything each nightTV: 1 TV, didn't use it

3 Minibar: Chocolate, small selection of alcohol- liquor and beer The liquor was $19/bottle for those tiny bottles The highest I've seen

1 Coffee: Coffee Bags- tea bag style, which I hate, and little milk cups They had a plunger and grounds but it cost $6

3 Desk: Ethernet cables, good size

3 Bathroom: Large tub, nice shower with top down and side shower heads Good temperature control that was consistent

1 Toiletry options: Decent size, but I had a really bad hair day the first day that I blame on the shampoo and conditioner Also, a couple of them were already open when I checked them And, the vanity kit was an empty box

3 Closet: Two closets, lots of room

3 Clock Radio: iPhone5 jack, didn't try it

3 View: Nice, but faced the wrong way

3 Thermostat: 28 <--> 16 Best I've seen, nice airflow

2 Special Features: They're under construction starting 7th July, ending in September They gave me a "noise survival kit" that included a fancy face mask, ear plugs, tea, and a shot of jack daniels 

1 They told me at reception they would refill anything I used the next day Unfortunately they did not Perhaps I just had a bad housekeeper

3 From the moment we arrived to when we left we felt totally spoiled We enjoyed a spacious a king room overlooking the wharf and city The room fittings are beautiful and unique maintaining its rich history including timber beams and iron features It was warm and beautiful overlooking the city skyline on a winter's evening at sunset

3 We had a perfect coffee and tea just a few minutes away at Toby Estate cafe in Woolloomooloo

3 We liked best the location of Blue, the excellent service, staff, the room and that our favourite restaurant in Sydney is on the same wharf It was winter so we weren't tempted by the indoor pool this time and it is a bit of a chilly walk at the moment to the pool through the area being renovated

3 This is a fabulous hotel but it can be very noisy on weekends from the wine bar area The music is extremely loud so try to get a room as far away as you can I'm surprised the hotel focusses so much on this clientele rather than the paying guests

3 This hotel has a great location for seeing attractions, shopping and restaurants Located on The Wharf it is metres away from some fantastic restaurants (including China Doll and Crinitis both which I'd highly recommend) It is a short walk away from the main shopping district and other major attractions

3 Good location, right next to a bunch of fancy restaurants Two locals advised us to steer clear of a street just up the road at night (apparently a little dodgey) - not a problem though, we just took an uber after dark

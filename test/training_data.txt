The covers on the bed felt damp, and the air smelt musty : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food and beverages always served with a smile and concierge area most helpful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
However the hotel is mainly aimed at people that just want to enjoy the beach and not experience much of the "real cultural Bali" : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The club offers great value for the money spent upgrading : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Trying to think of a down side all I could come up with was the flight but it was well worth it would not hesitate to go back : []
(maybe this could be included in the room rate as many other hotels offer Wifi for free???) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The attached beach at the back of the resort, just past the swimming pool, is almost private and one can stroll along it for miles : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

While there are many other hotels around competing for their quality, Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is going to opposite direction : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Better than Australia and cheaper : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
It will be very good if they hv indian recipes : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Overall this is a lovely place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of luxury or somewhere special, bear in mind though it's not cheap, but then nothing in Nusa Dua on the beachfront is : [u'location', u'forest']
The balcony overlooked superb gardens : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
:( There is a taxi counter after baggage collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']

Tide recedes in the mid to late afternoon, so plan accordingly : [u'location', u'sea']
I commend to the Hotel Management, Kadek Rasni - such a beautiful, kind soul for whom nothing was too much trouble, Walyi (a lovely lady, whose name I can't spell), again, she went out of her way - very gracious, Anik - she possessed excellent PR skills and with a wonderful sense of humor and Fedelia - great problem solving skills, although, absolutely ALL of the female staff were excellent : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

Didnt try the Spa this time but it was ok the first time and i didnt hear anyone complain : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Venturing just outside of it found considerably cheaper prices (anywhere up to a third cheaper for something like a massage or bottle of water!) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Had to cut down towards the end : [u'location', u'sea']
The Resort itself provides some fantastic theme nights with entertainment that were pretty good and it has some beautiful gardens and even the occasional night market stalls, bit pricey but convenient : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As it is close to the airport this hotel is a good place to start or end your journey to Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We were having a 'relaxing' massage but all we could hear was the lady chatting away in the room next door, for expensive massages this is not okay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Nusa Dua is on the penninsula with all the other higher priced hotels : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']

Location - this was prob the downside for us : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Would have preferred to stay at pool longer and then have happy hour drinks near the pool instead : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Things to look out for: : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bedrooms are small though (we were 3) and the layout of the bathroom makes it hard for two people to be in it at the same time : [u'location', u'sea']
Arrival - Naturally the security is high to enter the Nusa Dua area but fairly straightforward checks and the guards were very polite : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
This is huge hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We asked for a separate cot and single bed which was no problem : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Sadly the beach is blighted by plastic garbage like most Bali beaches , although the cleaners rake up the bags, bottles, and other rubbish ,the next day more just washers up from the ocean, the cleaners bury the garbage in the sand, not ideal, the main solution is too stop garbage getting into the ocean : [u'location', u'sea']
Hotel has private beach only a minutes walk from the pool area and is well maintained : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
I can have my breakfast now & come back later : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
In fact, very surprised how much we enjoyed the resort lifestyle : []
On the plus side the pools were good and the resort surrounds impeccably clean : [u'amenities', u'pool']
This time round was no different : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We also quickly noticed the vast arrange of activites and classes to do : []
The hotel was as described in the brochure and more : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The personnel was very friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There is a "Taxi" counter which is really a hotel car counter at two to four times the price of a taxi : [u'amenities', u'conference']
so you must known that there's possibility to take time (walking) to your room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
This wasn't very comfortable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Some minuses i can set only for the beach (was not so clean) and shower cabin can be more comfortable : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
With our deal we also got theme nights included and attended the Legong night and the beach BBQ : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Absolutely relaxing resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Just walk down 200-300m from resort and you will find can stand from where you can bargain up to 60-70% : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It has a bath and balcony : []
The service at times was very slow and i feel the food was over priced : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Staff, room, pool, breakfast was all good : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It has a good pool area with chairs also in the garden and easy access to the beach : []
The restaurants add a service charge and tax to the bill, which does bump the price up, but we were given vouchers to deduct from the bill, so it equalled out : []
This was our second stay at this hotel, and we must say it was even better than the first with more entertainment like classical guitar the BBQ/Fire dancers etc : []
breakfast was amazing with sausages, hash browns, waffles, pancakes, eggs, assorted bread etc : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We mainly ate in the hotel and there are a number of restaurants including a lovely outdoor pizzeria by the main pool : [u'location', u'sea']
It is just a short ride on the free shutle to shopping and restaurants(who drive you home for free) : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I look forward to coming back to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for another visit next time I come to Bali : []
Our friends (first timers) were very impressed and can't wait to come back again too : [u'overall', u'culture']
If you want to stay in a quiet place with private beach, pools and cocktails within a reasonable price, this one is perfect : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The services were prompt : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We made special friends with the bar man at the pool bar & each day we were treated like royalty (even though we only drank there in happy hour, which actually runs across a few bars from 4pm - 2 am!) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The 4 restaurants within the hotel all served beautiful, fresh food : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The air con in the second room was below average : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
They are quite pushy and take you straight to the money changer to get cash for their tip! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Also, as with other Bali businesses, always factor in the 'plus (service charge) plus (tax)' on all purchases : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It became very upsetting and spoilt my stay greatly : []
There is a cash machine towards the back of the hotel which was helpful : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This was our(me and my wife) first trip to Bali and undoubtedly we made an excellent decision to stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
The 25 m lap pool at the spa is an oasis of quietness and beauty : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
SHEAR LUXURY IN PARADISE : [u'location', u'sea']
Many people rave about the Palace Club but we booked the 8 night package which was great value : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They had a business centre but again the connection was terribly slow and you had the inconvenience of having to go to the business centre to use the internet : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We loved the place : []
Also highly recommended is the spa/pool area - a sanctuary within a sanctuary! : [u'location', u'general']
Coming back with my family next year : [u'location', u'sea']
There was also a full roster of activities at the fitness centre and the beach to keep everyone active, some of them with an additional cost such as the bike tour : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Now, there are a couple of things that should be addressed but they did not take our enjoyment of the place away : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
From the moment I arrived I was impressed : []
Being conscious of security I do remember walking out of the hotel at night and seeing a huge crowd of staff in the dark waiting for a ride home and this did feel a little eery : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Needless to say we will not be returning to this resort or recommending it to any friends : []

Only gripe is the excessive price of the food for quality that is actually quite average : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We took the upgrade to the Palace Club and are so glad we did : []
We stayed here for one week for our honeymoon : []
And again it was fantastic! Breakfast, staff : []

Stayed for a week in January and had a fantastic time : [u'location', u'sea']
The ground staff are exceptional and must work like fairies in the night as they are seldom seen and in no way intrusive, yet manage to ensure not a blade of grass is out of place, a tremendous credit to this 30+ year old resort : []
I must take this opportunity to make a special mention of the property as a whole is very beautiful and is surely very impressive morever all the pools and restaurants are ideally located and accessible also food served in all the restaurants are excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
I loved shopping through here except beware of the two fellows giving you tickets to win a prize : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My wife and I are not people that like being waited on hand and foot, although you could see with other guests, there was never a request that was too much for them to do : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

This is the 2nd time I have stayed at this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It's one of those hotels that give you the "feel good" feeling : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you can handle that, the beach is amazing! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
evening cocktails start at 5 : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']

We didn't use the palace club facilities : []
I am recommending this Hotel to everyone I know and will be back again soon : []
This is one of the original resorts in Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I suggest that you will benefit from using "google earth" to look at the location also : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great, pleasant staff, huge pools, great beach, heaps of food options : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This was our second visit to the Resort and an 8 night package : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua is a very quite area indeed with the last bar closing at 1pm : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
A great team from the lowest to the top : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Everything is just of such a high standard! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Lovely place to finish our holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Internet & wi fi not free : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The buffet breakfast is first class and extensive (I still miss it) but the buffet for the traditional entertainment night we went to was dreadful and an embarrassment to the executive chef : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Most of the restaurants will collect you and drop you back to your hotel for free (if you can plan this in advance or call them if you know where you want to eat) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great location, great staff, great surroundings but bathrooms/rooms(rate as 3 star due to their age) need renovating to keep up with some serious but expensive 5 star competition : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The Resort is very well positioned excellent facilities, restaurants reasonably proced, breakfast a very large variety to choose from, staff are very friendly and go out of there way to do whatever they can to assist : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great hotel to stay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Fabulous pools, gym, spa, themed nights & the food options were great, even catered for allergies!! Plus I even saw the turtles hatch! AMAZING!! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Did not leave the Nusa Dua strip for the whole 15 days : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
First off, the hotel itself is really stunning : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
However we attended three theme dinners which were sorely lacking : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Stunning, developed gardens and wildlife everywhere : [u'amenities', u'garden']
I would recommend this hotel to any travelers going to Bali : []
And highly flexible service very good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were shown to our room which was quite nicely appointed but the cleanliness was no where close to what a 5 star hotel should be : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The breakfast and the restaurants serve great food : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We walked & rode up & down the beach several times & inspected a couple of other resorts along the strip : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
My towel rail fell off in my room, I didnt have hot water in my room, and I could not open the bottled water due to a broken bottle opener : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Pool bar is an added bonus! Loved it and will definitely be back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I have to be honest, I just love this hotel : []
We enjoyed our spa, we wanted the 3-hours spa package though but we have tours during the day : []
All services and food outlets are great with a wide choice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Nusa Dua Resort also provides timely pick up and drops at specified timings throughout the Day to the local Mall - "Bali Collection" which boasts of abundant eateries covering mostly all major cuisines of the world : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We stayed at the Nusa Dua for a week during Easter : []
The best part is the staff : [u'amenities', u'conference']
There is very little to do except relax which is just what we wanted : []
We selected a Palace Club room for 8 nights : []
The pool area is very nice with a lovely beach : [u'location', u'general']
My husband and I spent the main part of our honeymoon here : [u'overall', u'culture']
The resort is 1st class all the way through : [u'amenities', u'pool']
That is why all the returning guests keep coming back and are a somewhat of a family within the hotel : [u'amenities', u'conference']
In the past I have spent alot of time at the Westin resort however, although beautiful it no longer has a club and def : []
Pretty sterile area : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
one small issue with the reservation on seats on the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Breakfast variety was good but quality was only average : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
this was a holiday of a lifetime : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel is one of the best hotel in Bali, love it here, their employees are well trained, educated and fast in response : []
We enjoyed the facilities : []
Almost free baby sitting from 9-5 pm! They even take the kids to the pool (pool next to the pool bar) : []
Good to see the manager out and about a lot, ditto the Executive Chef : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I had a most enchanting, relaxing and blissful six short days! Being a true 'Ballinese' design hotel of some 30 gracious years, the gardens are quite simply magnificent and seemingly wherever one looks, there are beautiful, mature gardens : []
However, because it looked so lovely, I invited my mother to fly up from Australia and share my room : []
My wife and I had 7 days here and loved it : [u'overall', u'culture']
I can appreciate this resort would also be perfect for those who are after a much more relaxed holiday than what we had : []
The afternoon tea was exceptional (excellent food), breakfast was without fault : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Breakfast was ridiculously good! Friends of ours got married here in May 2013 and also had nothing but great feedback : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Great atmosphere to enjoy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A great family holiday from the beginning to end! The pools are fantastic, the staff are beautiful and friendly, the beach is clean and the whole 'strip' of Nusa Dua is beautiful and accessible : [u'amenities', u'conference']
That would be my only very small criticism : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our second stay at this great Hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We highly recommend the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for a peaceful, relaxing,enjoyable holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Other than that I would definitely recommend Nusa Dua to those who want to travel to Bali and experience the serenity away from the touristy spots : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We Have enjoyed every minute staying here : []
the staff are lovely, magnificent gardens, wonderful spa area and the hotel itself retains a sense of old Bali which is becoming harder to find : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Hotel one of the originals in nusa dua so can do with a bit of an upgrade : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast was very nice, I personally am not one for the local cuisine however there were quite a few international options with a lot of fruit, pastries and pancakes/waffles available, we had no complaints about the breakfast : []
Though I requested a dvd player to be in my room at check in and it wasnt there : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
I could pick out a few names but I think this would be unfair to the rest of the staff as they all are so professional and friendly to all guests : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I really wished I understood what they were doing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Dining on the beach was just one highlight : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet', u'patio']
We did the pouring : []
The buffet breakfast is outstanding : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
At the time of our stay, part of the hotel was being renovated and the main pool was out of action but there was no noticeable noise or dust and the other pool was pleasant and not crowded : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The staff at Nusa Dua were really helpful and went out of their way to make it a special and memorable holiday especially the Guest Relations staff, Minako, Yoni and Dhini : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Excellent western food too (club, pizza) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is upmarket but is not as expensive as I thought and we would be happy to stay in Nusa Dua it again without hesitation : []
The atmosphere and the decoration meet it high expectation : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The bathroom contained a walk in shower with rain shower and a small spray shower with hairdryer, shampoos, shower gel, soap, shower cap, toothbrushes, tissues, and nail files : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
The hotel is a somewhat "tired" in places and in need of refurbishment as it is very 80's in room design and fittings but nonetheless the rooms are clean and functional with a good "wet" bathroom and excellent rain shower : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
I'M STILL STAYING HERE WHILST WRITING THIS REVIEW AND WANT TO ESCAPE : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We would wake up to birds chirping : []
We chose it as our honeymoon hotel based on reviews and star ratings in brochures, and to be honest we were quite disappointed : []
Everyone had a smile on their faces and never passed you without a lovely smile and a friendly greeting : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nice for a stroll : []
Missing Bali already! : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We had a great time here and would happily recommend this hotel for couples particularly : []
That is something to be mindful of when booking, if you are seeking peace and quiet and a restful night/day sleep enquire if children are above,around or next door, noise, crying, screaming travels, request a quite area : [u'overall', u'culture']
The setting was gorgeous and the staff were friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
5km away) , a Mall-type design of stores, supermarkets, clothing and merchandise stalls, and many restaurants, all of which will provide you with free taxi transport to and from the resort (provided you eat at their restaurant of course) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The service at the hotel is however excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
- Pools were nice and pool temperatures were perfect! : [u'location', u'sea']
The price for food and drink was exceptionally expensive : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Staff sang happy birthday to me and gave me a cake : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The beach is kept beautiful and loved the free bus to bali shopping complex : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Overall, a perfect romantic place to visit with loved ones : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Staff were really helpful and made our stay great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
everything is perfect!!! there is a beautiful temple in the hotel gardens and they perform pooja there every evening : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Didn't make use of spa area in the hotel, but it looked like it was having a refurbishment, so can't comment : []
The rooms are getting to the point of starting to need renovation : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The furniture was of a cheap quality which used to squeak on even sitting on them : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Kendi Kuning is actually within walking distance through the beach (10 mins walk) and the owner would happily pick you up : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Gardens are beautiful and spacious ,with many restaurants around the pool area : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Great Facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, the prices of these restaurants are expensive comparing local standards : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
You will have access to the Palace Buffet and Lounge which is quite nice : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Stayed here in June 2013 while attending the Coaltrans conference : [u'amenities', u'conference']
With our package we had lots of options for free meals, we did find that if you were more adventurous with your choice is was a bit bland but with so many tastes to cater for I suppose they err on the side of caution : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Beautiful resort professional staff beautiful well maintained gardens and buildings great spa would recommend to all has everything for families couples of all ages great for people from any country : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Safety is excellent, security car checks going and leaving the hotels and boom gates that are manned : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Much better than staying in Kuta or Legian if you want some quite, relaxation away from the madness : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hotel was amazing and beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Especially if you use the tollway : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff was so kind and attentive and did a great job : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This hotel is very beautiful with its Balinese decorations and lush greenery : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We would get our drinks from the shopping center and bring them back : []
The rooms looked superb, clean, modern and yet still with the feel of being in an exotic place : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
This is what we should have done to alleviate the inconvenience and stress it created : []
A happy hour cocktail is still going to set you back $9-$10 each : []
We had a very nice stay for two weeks in December : []
We ordered room service once - the nasi goreng was one of the best I've had in Bali - and ate at the traditional Indonesian restaurant another night : []
We were invited to some beautiful events, including the hotel's own Nyepi ( Day of Silence and Balinese New Year) ceremony in the hotel's home temple : []
They have beautiful voices, a good sense of humour and take song requests : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
It was great! : []
The hotel is surrounded by stunning tropical gardens and the views of the Indian Ocean are incredible : [u'room-experience', u'view']
Loved the food carving class : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
This time with two children, 14 and 10, deluxe room for 4 (two adjoining rooms) meant two bathrooms and worked well : [u'location', u'sea']
I believe in room wi-fi is chargeable but wasnt necessary for us : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The Sushi bar on the beach is great for lunch as it the pizza bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The suite was compact and traditionally furnished : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The pools are beautiful as well as the beachfront location : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
What we did was get friendly with a local taxi driver and get his phone number : []
but still it's a pleasant hotel with great location & good room rate value : []
The staff was gr8 : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
So I paid for 30 min and was back in after 15, and enjoyed none of it : []
For the 8 days we stayed in four hotels, including the neighbouring The Laguna and Discovery Partika in Kuta : []
The staff were friendly, but this hotel is so big it loses character and familiar faces, making it impersonal : []
Poor service around pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Thank you to all the Staff I miss those smiling faces and daily conversations we will return again : []
I will come back to this hotel some day : []
The room was further away and WiFi was deplorable : [u'amenities', u'internet']
I have seen the renovation and Now I can confirm that this place one of the best resort in Nusa Dua : []
Staff are super friendly and the hotel doesn't feel cramped with visitors, will be happy to stay here again : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The gym and Spa are great and the massage team is very professional : [u'location', u'sea']
The new restaurant on the beach when finished will be a great addition we were told there will be music each night so it will be a great spot to relax after dinner : []

A private pool overlooking the ocean was a great bonus : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The only disappointment was Maguro - not up to par with the others : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Forgot to take the do to disturb sign off the door and went out for the day, came back at 11pm to find a note telling us to contact us on our return and they'd come and do the room : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

Overall, this resort is one of the best, if not the best that i had ever stayed : []
We did have a marvelous time again (2nd time) : []
Comfortable and very quiet : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Everything was excellent, we would love to come again! I would recommend your resort to friends and family : []
The facilities seem to cater for every persons needs : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We felt thoroughly spoiled and special : []
Tranquility was high on my radar and after a quick and pleasant check in I was shown to my room which was on the second level : [u'amenities', u'conference']
stayed here with my family on dec 2012, : []
Our family group of 5 adults and 5 children had a ball! The food was good, service excellent, staff were helpful and friendly : [u'amenities', u'conference', u'recreation']
Stayed here for 3 weeks and loved every second of it! Kids had a blast! Very family friendly : []

I got news for you lady - you never have more than 5 kids there! So my daughter ended up doing scintillating jigsaw puzzles for the whole hour : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Urs the General Manager and all of his staff do everything they can to make sure your stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is an experience that you will not forget : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
5 star hotels often charge a lot and they see their clients as $$$! Well, there is nothing wrong with offering excellent service and ask for the price but of course it is very important to offer such service with friendly staff and values : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There is a nice park at the headland along towards the Bali Collection which is a memorial to those who died in the Bali bombing : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We stayed in one of the Palace Club rooms, which was furnished in traditional Balinese style and had everything we needed, including doors out onto a patio area which looked out over the impressive gardens : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will absolutely return for another holiday soon : []
Having stayed on three separate occasions in Bali at the Grand Bali Hyatt, the Intercontinental and the Kamandala, and on our outward trip this time at Poppies, where the standards at all were excellent, our experience at the Nusa Dua Beach bore no resemblance to any of those hotels, nor, indeed, to any of the numerous hotel we have ever stayed at in South East Asia : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We wanted to be spoiled and we were : []
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa only really stands out if you don't compare it with these two neighbours : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There was great variety in food and all the staff were friendly and helpful : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
2nd visit to Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We'll for sure return again ! : []
The option now is in small kids club , pool and playing sand the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
There's a free shuttle to the bali collection, u can purchase the water fm there is around 1600 rupia : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Staff always ready to help and always have a smile on their faces no matter how busy they were : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Had the time of my life : [u'location', u'sea']
I found the food very expensive in room service and restaurants : []
And the fitness centre looked pretty good : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Lunch at the Italian is a must, pizzas are a winner! Real Italian style : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
But as stated very enjoyable and great service by all whom we dealt with : []
I also found a piece of wood type art (with quite sharp edges) protruding from the bottom end board of the bed : []
Our daughter enjoyed the Gecho kids club, and loved the kids swimming pool : [u'overall', u'culture']
I had a wonderful stay, and found the hotel to be everything I wanted for a relaxing, romantic honeymoon : []
We stayed in a Palace Club Room, imagine our surprise at being recognized and welcomed with open arms, our previous visit was a year ago to the minute : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Spent the first two nights sleeping in w/chair : []
The daily activities organised by the hotel are also really well organised and the staff friendly and knowledgeable : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Alcoholic drinks are relatively expensive, however I understand these are a consequence of Government taxation policies and would be unfair to compare prices other than with similar establishments : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We had heard varying things about Bali : []
Our experience with this hotel was nice, tranquil and comfy : [u'overall', u'feel']
The grounds are just amazing : [u'overall', u'safety']
Has a slippery slide which my son enjoyed very much! : [u'amenities', u'conference']
You don't wanna go to Bali to be on the internet : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Currently staying at the hotel and it is great for kids : []
All the plants were named so it was like being in a botanical garden : []
I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a great family holiday : []
Some notes below: : [u'location', u'sea']
There is a large water monitor lizard that you get to see close up : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Definitely worth a stay here! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I did not have much of a time to explore most of the amenities available though! : []
What's a pity it's so far away from here : []
Pools were good but normal problem with greedy self centred tourists who "reserve" their poolside lounge first thing in the morning and don't use it till the afternoon : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Good service, good amenities and a couple of first class restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Also Lastini at the Beachfront Restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Disappointed when we arrived, and our other couple were not booked in : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Food is expensive and "special event" nights grossly overpriced, but on the whole, we were more than happy to eat lunch and have drinks/ccktails and felt that they were worth it : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
- Some staff are super nice and friendly (some are not, however) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Came back in October with my youngest son who is 8 yrs old, and it just as I remembered and enjoyed it just as much : []
Great landscaping and cute ducks : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only place with decent food is their Raja restaurant : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
In fact, if anything, our experience this time was better : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One of the pool even had water deep enough for diving : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The overall resort has its charm of old world Bali, located in one of the most accessible area of Nusa Dua : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The gardens were beautiful and serene : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Metalia, our vow renewal co-ordinator, deserves an extra special mention : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Ideal location for relaxing on the beach or by the pool and a good variety of food/drink offered : []
Will definitely be coming back again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Our room faced the garden view which in my opinion, was even better than the sea view : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I expected the hotel to be a bit dated due to it's vintage but was pleasantly surprised by the recently refurbished rooms and tastefully simple decor : []
The bar was nice and particularly having drinks out on the outdoor terrace was very relaxing : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We had a lovely time at the Resort : []
The room has a tub which opens into the bed area : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Once we arrived, we were taken to our room which was lovely - probably a little smaller than I thought but very clean and modern : []
In the end it was not really an issue as we had no problem hiring a taxi and the cost was minimal : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Nusa Dua Beach Resort was simply amazing! : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Breakfast was very good, lots of pastries and fresh fruit along with hot items, eggs benny, omelets, pancakes and traditional foods : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
All in all, a good place to stay : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Staff were friendly, the room and grounds were simply beautiful!!! : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Also, they remember how you like things and in offering, do so in that manner (eg would you like your soy latte with sweetener today) : []
Very Quiet location, with paved walking path meandering along the beach for kilometres, excellent clean quiet beach directly opposite the resort, lots of shade even on the beach, large well kept lawns and gardens : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- F&B is good, i try some cocktail and meals are fulfill my taste : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Overall, stay was good, pools are big enough, so you won't feel too crowded, but not enough beach chairs though : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall, if we ever return to Bali, this would be the resort we'd come back to without hesitation : []
We just spent 7 nights on a family holiday with two teenagers : []
The rooms and bathrooms were in need of updating, "tired," the expression others have used : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Be advised however, some of the prices they quote on the menus are EX-TAX - that is you need to add approximately 21% tax on top : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Count me out whilst Urs lives in cloud cuckoo land : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
It is the best hotel in Bali : []
We have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the last few years : []
Thank you guys : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Although the hotel faces east, you can get a semblance of a sunset view by going into the sea and looking back towards the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I have to add that we found all staff genuinely welcoming, professional, attentive and very helpful : []
I did enjoy syating at this hotel however I do think the hotel can improve on customer service when it comes to basics : []
You can sit there looking at the squrills run ip and down the large trees or the swallows flying around all day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel is a member of Leading Hotel of the World that have a reasonable price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
best choice ever : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beautiful gardens and fantastic spa facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just returned from 9 glorious days in Bali all spent at the Nusa Dua hotel : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
No complimentary afternoon tea which is quite common elsewhere : [u'amenities', u'conference']
You set the bar for service and kindness : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They prey on the "first timers" to Bali don't be fooled! One of the worst things is the lack of Internet : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The sun lounges were in a good position and were always available : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The restaurants look beautiful, but we preferred to eat in nearby restaurants : []
Furthermore the cleaners always seemed more interested in cleaning our room than returning at a more suitable time : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
For once the weather was kind to us for our entire stay so we made the most of the main pool area and its swim up bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I am not impressed with hotels that have empty buffet dishes at 10am when breakfast ends at 10:30am : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There is a free courtesy bus that runs from the hotel on the hour to the nearby Bali Centre, which is a small modern shopping Mall with outside shops, restaurants and shops, well worth a visit : [u'amenities', u'conference']
There are a number of restaurants in the hotel grounds with a variety of food types (local, Italian, etc) : [u'location', u'sea']
The balcony looked out onto well manicured lawns and gardens : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
It's gorgeous, big, right next to the beach and the staff is outstanding (special shout out to Asri and Mr : []
Would not consider any other place in Bali : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Our room was spacious and beautiful! The Balinese architecture of the resort is amazing : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
They have a compliemntary professional photograph taken aginst a picturesque backdrop : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Shopping nearby : [u'location', u'general']
As first time travellers to Bali we will return to Nusa Dua Beach : []
We come back ! : []
Everything about this hotel is excellent : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We could not have stayed in a better hotel : []
Internet access was generally good, with some patchy performance : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I would have rate the hotel 3 : []
Everything else was great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach was nice to but not for swimmers, be careful of the seas urchins : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
comment i would make about breakfast (palace) was that it never changed and not a big range and too many pastries : []
Sadyana a manager in the Palace club was easy to talk to and a very happy person, all the staff are in the resort are very friendly : [u'amenities', u'pool']
You may not find any good main course : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But we let him play with the sand at the beach, and yes the water is chill : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Its not a bad hotel all considered, which is why so many people rate it highly, but in the end the room just got to us especially as the weather wasn't great and we wanted to spend more time in there : []
Within close proximity to Bali Collection and local markets : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I would expect that Palace Rooms should include free airport transfers but is not available this is included in most elite resorts , so really should be included here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was my birthday while we were here and we didn't inform anyone but one night we returned to a birthday cake and fruit basket : []
My husband and i stayed here for five night on our honeymoon and couldn't have had a better time : [u'location', u'sea']
The beach is excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The Mee Goring there is incredible, I had it twice : []
We went there for my wedding and everything was so beautifully organised and so relaxing because they have it all under control : [u'overall', u'safety']
Can't help the 21% vat, but would love to know about the +20% service fee on all the bills : []
We didn't do much exploring but will do next time : []
I was not asked to pay for wifi anywhere else in Indonesia so why would a large and expensive hotel have to charge? : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Stayed there for 5 nights in May : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On arrival I was greeted with a welcome drink and cool towel, extremely efficient check in and shown to my room : []
The Hotel possesses a wonderfully relaxing ambience : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It was huge and amazing : []
We enjoyed taking the bikes out as a family but could be quite costly if out for long or often! All in all a really great holiday and we would love to come back maybe next time for a special birthday and bring the rest of our family! Thank you everyone for a super holiday : []
A marvelous experience at the Nusa Dua Resort, this was my third stay at the Palace Club : [u'overall', u'feel']
An excellent place to stay for those who are looking for a typical resort : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We went to Bali Collection (a shopping center in the area with restuarants) for dinner most nights and there if the food was dissapointing at least we did not overpay : []
We would definitely recommend the upgrade if you can stretch to it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast buffet was excellent but our dinner at one of the hotel restaurants was not satisfactory for it's high price : []
Breakfast service very good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our wedding day was sheer bliss! This hotel and all staff are first class in every aspect from grounds, rooms, service, location, friendliness : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We just got back from a fantastic holiday at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : []
If you want peace, this is the place to stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Service: Truly excellent, friendly, corteous and unobstrusive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Restrants are all nice and not so expensive : []
Breakfast was a bit of a disaster because flies and bugs were invading the open buffet which i could not dare to eat from , but you can still order your eggs and waffles to be done : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Reni and Dwi did an amazing job, nothing was too much trouble for them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The temperature in March/April and the encompassing humidity you really need a pool which should refresh you and we found that this did not happen : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On the plus side, the buffet breakfast was terrific, but not all that different to the others : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Internet access is available free of charge as well, soft drinks are available free at any time in the Palace Club lounge : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
(See above for better option) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The rooms felt too humid even with a/c on : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The pools are right next to the beach as well : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
2) Ideal for family vacation : [u'overall', u'culture']
The food was wonderful gained a few extra pounds from the potato wedges which was midnight snack the entire stay from room service : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I had pre-payed for massages when I booked out room : []
I should add they have water aerobics in the pool every morning - I am sure some people love it, but it is a pet hate of mine at hotels to have ridiculously loud music pumping through the pool area at 10am and shouting instructor, but maybe that is just me! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Therefore it was pity that the Spa treatment was lack of its skill compared to other Hotels : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
After scoping out the Nusa Dua area during our last trip, we settled on NDBH as the next place to holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Would happily stay here again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
With the new toll road/bridge, Kuta and the airport are much quicker to get to as well : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We were quite unlucky with drapes falling down and tiles falling down in the doorway if the toilet : []
I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bali and will definitely come back! : []
I didn't want to make a big deal out of it so I let it go with slight disappointment : []
Thank you for making Bali a wonderful destination for us : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
About the see to be honest I was expecting to see better see like Maldives but here it was different : []
it may be disappointing : []
We stayed in the Palace Club wing,was the same with a few new renovations,going for the simplistic feel : []
We enjoyed cocktails at the pool bar and walking along the beachfront : []
So we took the free shuttle bus to Bali Collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Restaurant was nice with a nice selection of food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Food was fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The staff were patient and extremely helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Its really easy to pass time without ever leaving the resort and that's not a bad thing : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Our family wanted to come again in future : [u'overall', u'culture']
I had several treatments and I can highly recommend Buni as i think she gives the best massage! thanks Buni :) : [u'overall', u'culture']
We will certainly come back again in the future : []
negative: finshing in the room could be little bit better, bottle of water in room had mold on the plastic, airco always on when you're not in the room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Will purchase voucher deal again : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
And please watch out for the scalding hot plates : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I prefer this hotel than Sofitel which has contemporary design : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We ate here at the Nusa Dua Beach Cafe in the resort nasi goreng was rp 92,000 out side at the cafe it was rp 36,000 : []
that's the beauty of this resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would prefer more privacy for the bathroom in the room when staying with friends - can be noisy when using the bathroom while others sleep : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I eat this dish every time it is on a menu so am used to much variation but this offering was not served in tomato sauce or baked : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
THE POSITIVES: The staff in the Palace Club (during the day) especially Dian, (who was my saviour), were wonderful : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
However, the biggest complaint was that both bathrooms and toilets were never cleaned properly, nor did the bed linen ever smell fresh : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
The spa is stunning but a little pricey compared to other places around Nusa Dua : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
We had lots of fun feeding the squirrels and birds with pieces of fruit and nuts from the mini bar : []
The restaurants offered a wide selection of menus ,with polite efficient staff : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Friendly staffs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We paid the extra again and stayed at the palace club so the afternoon tea and cocktails was included : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Restaurants - all the bars were great too : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
They were my only choice for transport and were so much cheaper (5,000 compared to 30,000) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Nusa Dua hotel is huge consisting of 3 pools, 5 restaurants & 2 bars : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We didn't even bother to get out for dinner, because the restaurants offer the food that we liked : []
The total experience was one of sheer luxury at a supurb resort : [u'overall', u'feel']
On a Luxury Escapes holiday and really enjoyed our stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In short it was mind blowing : []
At Palace Club level the general choice of food was fine but somewhat disappointing at cocktail hour : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The social area is very pleasant, and the Balinese style entrance garden is certainly a plus : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Very good facilities for wheelchair bound people as plenty of ramps the only problem we could sewas access to the pool as the steps are rather deep : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The Balinese people and their lovely smiles and friendly and relaxed nature just makes you relaxed too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is a long line of hotels along the beach, so first evening I recommend going for a walk along the waterfront to check out other hotels and their numerous restaurants/bars : []
) Breakfasts are HUGE : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We were greeted by the Manager of the hotel and made to feel very welcome from the moment we stepped out of the taxi : []
such a beautiful hotel location and staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food at all the restaurants were delicious and the special nights had such variety of food you couldn't try them all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Only used as day room but facilities were exactly what we needed to refresh and relax on way to airport : []
We found that the service at chess restaurant was only ever half acceptable if the manager was in sight on two occasions we actually left the table after being ignored for an unacceptable length of time : []
It was nice but I wouldn't go back here : []
At night they had live piano & singer by the lobby lounge area and was quite superb! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The building is a bit too old and defiintely needs renovation, and the rooms are okay, but the TV is from 80s and showing black and white while playing DVD for some reasons : []
Before booking, a travel agent told us that there was nothing to do in Nusa Dua so recommended only a short stay : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The vendors kept their distance unless you beckoned them to approach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
At our table, ants marched in lines up the table cloth after remnants of food the birds and squirrels had spilled : [u'location', u'forest']
But we felt that the location of the hotel more than made up for certain issues (like a spider's nest for example) : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We will be returning as soon as possible : []
Great staff, location was perfect : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
such a lovely place warm and friendly atmosphere very welcoming, right on the beach, very friendly staff ,lovely location recommend to anyone to go here, the choice of food in the restaurants was very good and tasted amazing!!! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The food is excellent and all Restaurants are woth to visit : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
But the pool was great so no big loss : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We had our honeymoon last year in Bali and stayed here for 13 nights after being in ubud : []
everything from the beach to restaurants to ambience to rooms - amazing! It was a pity tho that sucha great hotel had terrible staff : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
You know this feeling when you see fotos of your hotel and after arriving you recognize that these were made nice to cover the disaster of the hotel? : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There is a free shuttle to Bali Collection shopping centre with lots of shops and decent restaurants : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
The hotel is beautifully decorated with lots of woodcarvings and other Balinese art : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Well, the hotel staffs were really nice : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Very cool : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beautiful hotel and grounds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
i cant really say from where but maybe a/c : []
Kids will never be bored there : [u'overall', u'culture']
com/stand-up-paddle ) as my wife wanted to try Stand Up Paddle for the first time : [u'location', u'sea']
The lap pool stunning : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Several swimming pools so it wasn't hard to find a vacant deck chair : []
You wouldn't swim at the beach because of sea urchins but the pools make up for that with a beach style pool for the kids and a deeper one with a bar for adults : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
My wife and I were in Bali for a friend's wedding : [u'overall', u'culture']
the standard room just ok, but the club room was amazing : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
This was very spacious and comfort living : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed in Singapore 4 days our way back home : []
If you plan to spend time with your children at Nusa Dua Beach Spa & Hotel do not hesitate because they have facility like a children day care & they have a swimming pool for children : [u'overall', u'culture']
Try the Tavern in the road leading into Nusa Dua, excellent service and great food and very cold Bintang reasonably priced : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
and don't bother to tidy around the pool all day, with wet towels lying everywhere and sun lounges all over the place! A bit of direction from management I think is needed here : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
& so helpful, & loved the massages ! The Breakfast's were Great, and nothing was too much trouble for the excellent staff : []
The food was very good though : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Restaurants: Excellent in general and not overpriced : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Very well equipped with high standard even on the beach area witch is not so common in many resorts on Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We booked a deluxe room for 4, which was 2 adjoining rooms on the 2nd floor that overlooked the main pool & had views of the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It has a beautiful, huge pool which the hotel is centred around : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff were so friendly and made our stay memorable! The general manager even introduced himself on our first day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a Palace club suite : []
- rooms are old and outdatded, felt like 3 star standard : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We would love to come back and stay : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The hotel has been extensively renovated but still has the wow factor that I remembered : []
A must do ;) WE love this Hotel 10/10 : []
Could not fault anything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My children loved to see the first turtle hatch in your Turtle Hatchery on the last day of our stay : [u'overall', u'culture']
Had a truly great stay in the Palce Club : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel restaurants offered a variety of quality meals including Western, Asian and Balinese specialities, located beachside or poolside : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
It was my husbands birthday and the hotel provided the richest chocolate cake we've ever had and flowers - all without prompting or request - these are the touches that make a stay special and to be remembered- thank-you Nusa Dua Beach Resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Instead of renting a taxi through the hotel, we rented directly from the driver and made the arrangements on our way from the airport the first day : []
The club lounge was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
Beautiful staff but activities need changing and need to be more exciting : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
- Beach was large and clean (although the sea can be a little rough and strong longshore drift meant it wasn't ideal for swimming in, but there's nothing the hotel can do about that!) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Beach is fine, the sea is warm and calm, although very shallow during low tide, wonderful staff and very good restaurants : [u'location', u'sea']
I'd recommend with no hesitations to my friends for a great vacation to Bali : []
I was a little concerned that my return visit wouldn't be able to match the wonderful experience of the first trip but I neednt have worried : []
I would be happy to liaise with the hotel directly in regard to my comments : []
We enjoyed all the facilities that the place gave, from tennis, gym, pool and water aerobic : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Pleasant awakening with squirrels : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Lap pool is good though, quiet and possible to swim a km without trouble, nice to have sauna and steambath as well : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The exerience was very calm and personal : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- Free shuttle bus to Bali Collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
There is a timetable in the gym area that shows all the activities for the week - many of them free of charge : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
way too short if you visiting Bali and want to enjoy the Hospitality of this amazing hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Resort manages a beautiful beach with some cute trees! : [u'amenities', u'pool']
I went with my best friend and decided on Nusa Dua beach because of the great recommendations : []
the spa is amazing in that it is the only spa i have been too that plays the generic hotel music : []
All on site restaurants and bars were of the highest quality, and the friendly staff tended to your every need with a smile : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
You do need to book in advance though as there is a good chance they cannot fit you in on the day you choose if you do not : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only problem with this hotel is the wifi : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The beach is lovely and clean, the water is warm and has lots of fish in it - if you like to snorkle : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On our first day the hotel was quite crowded but this was because it was "Silence Day" in Bali and no one was allowed to leave the grounds of the hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Sometimes the ants are a bit of a problem : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Everything about this hotel from its location through to the rooms and its public areas are fantastic : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort is spotless and you have a feeling of safety and a calming atmosphere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Only complaint I had during our stay was inability to obtain WiFi reception in our room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We stayed only for one night at 10 August 2013 but we very pleased to stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
Those facilities were good too : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
When I saw the pictures in this home page, I feel like old style atmosphere, but when I finally I realized this hotel have something different : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Room quality is reasonable, but our air condition (Rm 3003) was not cold enough : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
favourites was the omelettes and the fresh bread selection especially the brioche when toasted with butter and mango jam : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
definitely the place for those who likes beach, and some peace and quiet : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The highlight of our hotel? The squirrels, so cute and if you're quiet and gentle, they'll feed from your hand! We are already planning our return : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The people were very friendly : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I would have got it lower but the driver was complaining the to hotel taxi desk clerk, Dewa, who was very helpful though : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We stayed in this HUGE resort with 3 kids in an adjoining room : []
We loved it but wondered if it was slightly through rose tinted glasses because of tge occasion : []
-local flavours should be encourage to certain extend especially the porridge : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We love that the resort is 30yrs old and has the authentic Bali feel, if we wanted the Gold Coast luxury resort we would have just gone to one, but when you come to Bali don't you want to feel like your in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food was very good however and the facilities were top notch : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It was such an amusing and hilarious incident : []
But of course Hotel staff friendliness was more important and last time we missed Indonesian beer which was removed and replaced with San miguel, that problem was fixed, thanks, Bintang was back : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Overall a really relaxing stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would i stay here again? hmm thats a hard one : []
I am a very frequent traveller to Bali, (this would be trip 51) so I do have very high expectations : []
It offers everything that you could ask for : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
every thing is very good in this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If you are bored of the beach, you can take a free shuttle to Bali collection : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I have nothing but praise for all your efforts and will definitely be back for another relaxing holiday at your resort : []
Meals at this resort are great : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
So we headed out to the beach (GORGEOUS soft white sand) and tried to fly our kite : [u'location', u'forest']
Check in staff had no idea what they were doing and took ages, rooms are very standard, shower floods if you have it turned up to much, the balcony was very small and there was cockroaches crawling around in room! Overall not a 5 star experience : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The grounds are beautiful : [u'overall', u'safety']
And if you want to see the real Bali, I would suggest you visit Kuta, Denpasar or the rice fields : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Chess bar was fine but we would highly recommend Rajas where we were treated extremely well by the staff and the food was fab : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
At the time, we were afraid she might have broken her ankle : [u'overall', u'culture']
Cant wait to return with the kids! : [u'overall', u'culture']
I personally chose this hotel for its Balinese design and the beach : []
There is a shuttle bus but not run by the hotel : [u'location', u'airport', u'station']
Beautiful location and surroundings : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
What we paid for and what we go were two different things : []
We booked a premier room and have ocean and pool views : []
Witnessed a couple of instances of disputes between guests over sun lounges around the pools which I think would be easily remedied by maybe getting some hour glass sand timers or something like that so you had only a 1 hour window to leave your chairs unattended so someone else could use them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Being in the Palace club was wonderful breakfast fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Great info for excursions : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'others']
30 till 10 : []
Children - we bought in our own nanny from outside which the hotel was perfectly happy with : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I would say for people who want to go to Bali for Bali, not a resort maybe stay here a few days then head to a more cultural area : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
I was picked up by the hotel car at the airport : []
A bit pricy but in line with the 5 star surroundings : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Maybe all the renovations mentioned are completed by now? : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
But from other reviews I see that this is a general problem : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food and day spa is soooooo overpriced, and if we didn't have vouchers from he holiday deal we would never have eaten or got a massage on site : []
Breakfast, evening snacks, and all day beverage provided : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There is hotel beachside service with just the raise of a flag : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Bed was two doubles pushed together which was uncomfortable in the middle and on arrival the staff did not provide us with much information about the resort or Nusa Dua area but apart from this we had a wonderful stay : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The Palace Club (like a corporate club) was excellent with the highlight no doubt being the excellent staff, nothing was too much trouble for them and they always had a warm greeting and smile on arrival : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa it's a big hotel area : []
we requested a double room and got two single beds : []
The resort offers a number of other restaurants around the pool area and on the beach side : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The Premior Pool view room - large room very close to pool with sea view as well, huge king bed very comfortable, separate toilet and large bathroom : [u'room-experience', u'view']
Compared to other hotels in the same price range, it is probably the most beautiful and generous place in Nusa Dua : []
The staff were extremely attentive, helpful and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Nusa Dua Beach Resort had a competitive price : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Nearly EVERYWHERE in Bali you can haggle for the cost : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Security is always visible and you can be approached by vendors, but there is no hassle once you say 'No' : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
-Easy access to private beach just past the pool area : [u'location', u'general']
The pool was beautiful, but we had to get there at 7am to make sure we got a lounge! Some lounges were left empty (but reserved with towels) for the majority of the day so people just came down and used them at their leisure : []
Overall better than expected and will probably return for 1 month stay next year : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One notable aspect of the resort we particularly liked, was that the hotel never felt crowded : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The buffett breakfast was first class : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
As you enter the resort, the lobby and grounds look amazing : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
We also had a few issues making our booking : []
Very good value, except for the hotel restaurants, good but a bit pricey, and the free wifi which is of poor quality : [u'amenities', u'conference']
A bit surreal, to walk in a suit along a Beach path on a tropical paradise in Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
It caters for the low end however eg : []
This was a short stay for our wedding anniversary : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua is a very strange resort, it is beautiful and impeccably clean, there are large ornamental gates to the resort which is essentially just several high quality hotels down a nice stretch of beach : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This was the first stop on our honeymoon trip (for 5 nights), this hotel is accredited in the 'best hotels in the world' programme and, having travelled extensively in recent years we can say with confidence it is exactly that! The room we had was huge, well furnished with a modern balianese feel, the bed was really comfortable and the balcony looked over the sea : []
Despite the age of this resort, the facilities are well maintained and cleanly kept with extensive gardens and spaces to relax along with a private beach area : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
My husband and I stayed from 30th October for 5 nights and had a fantastic time : [u'location', u'sea']
Despite this breakfast was excellent and we loved the pizza bar : []
you can feel it aging especially the cleanliness of the room/hallways : []
The way the hotel gave flowers and fruit bowl to our room on hearing our little boy was unwell, was such a pleasant surprise : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We just absolutely loved the food, the people and the place and couldn't recommend a better resort especially for such a great price : []
The staff were run off their feet because there didn't seem to be enough staff to cope with the amount of guests : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
In the dark it was impossible to avoid stepping on them and having them pop like light bulbs : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Staff can barely speak English, which, I would expect I from a budget hotel, not a 5 star resort : []
The grounds are stunning and the service is first class and we felt at home instantly : []
NDBH is a beautiful hotel, with friendly staff : []
This hotel has the most real charm of all : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The rooms are Balinese in design and vary in size (we stayed twice during our visit to Indonesia) : []
) The floor in room is so slippery I've slipped over once already and have had a few other close calls : []
Going back to the Beach Hotel, the service is good and you will see everywere staff cheering and smiling at you and this put you in a very good mood : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool area was extremely dangerous as the type of stone that surrounds the pool becomes very slippery when it is wet (which is pretty much all the time) and we all slipped on it at different times : []
There is an amazing array of TV channels to choose from in the rooms, very good if you just want to blob out in front of the TV, or if it's raining outside! : []
We had booked a Palace Club room but on arrival were upgraded to a suite : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Enjoyed my stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Within 10 mins of arrival, we were checked and in our room : []
What did I like the best ? I think I really liked everything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Of course, when we went to this room, we realised it was facing the aformentioned construction site : []
The room and bath were clean just in need of update : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Although the fully inclusive meal deal took a little bit of working out and an included deal to visit a show at another venue meant we couldn't use one of the dinner meals it was still very good value overall : []
Perhaps indicating the need of renovation to match other resorts around the vicinity : [u'location', u'general']
00 for a wine at St Regis Nusa Dua!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not as nice a resort we felt anyway : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
And I was not disappointed : []
We really liked this hotel, the staff were friendly and the service was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Hotels Balinese theme was fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I suggest they should change the menus and it cater mostly for Ang MOH : []
Calm,wide, clean, friendly, pretty garden and relax atmosphere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Where do I start?? Well the resort is fantastically located and that is the only positive I can provide : []
the place was not booked up : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I guess a complete renovation of this place would help a lot : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
This seems to be an issue with communication (or understanding of english) with the restaurant staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast is very good with a lot of options : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Definitely will come back to stay in this place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Everything is Nico and clean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The cocktails were still very good and staff so attentive and gracious : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
The palace club is the best! Great experience : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Only one thing-low water pressure : []
They are very dated and shabby, should have been upgraded years ago : [u'location', u'sea']
Worst though: the room was tiny, old, no hooks in the bathroom to hang things up, in fact the sink was right off from the bedroom, not as a separate full bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
A spacious room, huge ensuite with rooms being serviced a number of times during the day : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
This resort is luxury : [u'amenities', u'pool']
I didn't want to stay at a sterile five star resort which could be anywhere (Hawaii, CA, etc : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The food in the restaurants we tried (4 out of 5 tried) was all very good and not badly priced for people coming from Australia : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The rooms were cleaned daily and the hotel facilities were well maintained : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
rooms are clean and fresh : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
However, when it comes to their rooms, it was appalling : []
To get a pool side seat under an umbrella you need to be there early though : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
More traditional Balinese style hotel compared to some others around the area, a very good Hotel in great location, (walking distance to Nusa Dua Markets, and Bali Collection) : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'bike-ride']
This was a really nice resort in the gated Nusa Dua area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- Rooms were reasonably modern (our block had recently been refurbished), clean and thoroughly serviced on a daily basis : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The rooms were nice and clean and the grounds were beautiful : [u'overall', u'safety']
1) The master bed creaks as soon as you sit on it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A visit to the Poolside restaurant was disappointing as the Lobster was overcooked : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Also needs to upgrade to free Wi Fi in the room which on international standards is available : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Flyscreens would enable doors to be left open at night : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
That's probably not specific to this Hotel, but it gets my goat : []
Fyi, the "Bali feels" is not luxury by all means, but has the culture built into it : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Wonderful staff, good food, but not walking to outside the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Buffet for breakfast is a fair variety from continental things to local specialities : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Everything from the welcome, room, food, beach, facilities etc : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The rooms are quite small, particularly compared to the Hilton, the beach wasn't that great, the pools were cold, the lobby not that spectacular : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The hotel provides service while relaxing on the beach, there is just a few people selling things on the beach but they are not intrusive : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Don't expect to just walk to the beach and rent a jet ski or anything : [u'location', u'mountains']
We love the friendly and efficient staff : []
Have a wonderful, amazing trip! : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
I stay in this hotel with my wife and 8 and 4 year old boys : [u'overall', u'culture']
We ate at the restaurant by the pool - delicious & saw the kakec Dance during our stay which was a highlight! $1000 USD Resort Credit which could be spent throughout all areas of the Resort!! Free transfers to/from resort : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It was just bad luck and can happen to swimmers anywhere : []
Constructive criticism: Being picky now but : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was my first visit to Bali, I made the reservation through the internet and I was lucky to choose the hotel : []
Lots to do for children too : [u'overall', u'culture']
Room is great with garden view with squirrels, birds : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We ate at the Chess bar one night and it was the most romantic candlelit dinner on a beach we had ever had : []
We got to see the kecak dance with authentic Indonesian dinner : []
I returned to Australia today after nine nights at this resort : []
Our concerns were managed adequately by the F & B manager and the GM although when compared to how such matters would be dealt with in Dubai where we live the management reaction was somewhat laid back although this is from our experience to be expected in a private independent hotel rather than a brand resort where collateral brand damage is not at risk : [u'overall', u'safety']
Use the new toll bridge when you can as it saves sitting in the heavy traffic (get used to that though as heavy traffic is the norm in Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
GRound are great very clean, service in the palace club in the evening was very poor , we waited 40 mins for our drinks order , staff were selective in who they served other visitor got preference at evening time , we felt neglected on all 3 evenings , not like the service when we visited the last time : []
Nice spa with additional pool, saunas, whirlpool, where we mostly were along : []
The entire place is beautiful traditional Balinese architecture : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Don't get me wrong, they were great and new but in my opinion sterile : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They are not responsive to e-mails, but fortunately the experience was much better in the hotel : [u'overall', u'feel']
Cleanliness was good but not spotless - but by Bali standards I think it was very good : []
Note you MUST tell the driver that you wish him to use the expressway ,at your cost of 10,000 rupiah : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
good location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Now for the flaws : breakfast quality is ok, but variety must be improved, our room is humid, the tile in our room is very moist, the bed sheet is a bit moist, probably caused by the old aircon : []
Our suite had two main rooms: the living room area with separate second toilet, extra tv, and yummy tea making facilities and the large bedroom area with a super comfy king size bed, satellite tv, DVD player, minibar, fridge, massive en suite bathroom with separate bath, and closet/suitcase area : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Beach area is also very nice : [u'location', u'general']
Club Med are the pros in this field : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We hope to get back to the hotel before he retires in 2015 : []
-For only 2 nights, I was able to relax and unwind : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Overall if you want a budget friendly stay, or perhaps if your more intent on touring and not going to be in the hotel much, this hotel works : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
there are guides on the beach who arrange them for you and its really cheap : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The perfect holiday on a paradise island with fantastic people and optimum service, highly recommended to everyone!! We travel to Bali every year and always stay at this hotel because it offers genuine Bali traditions and is not just another luxury hotel which you can find all around the world : []
Otherwise our stay was fantastic! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is very small and old : []
Ever so slightly tired around the pool areas - pools not quite as flash as the ones at the Westin or some of the others, the pool loungers older, towels not as smart - but frankly, the prices reflect that : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
From checking into the hotel to our last day there was so so perfect! The people are kind, helpful & you will want to stay there longer : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
As for Bali itself I feel that it is terribly overrated : []
Couldnt pick any faults, they were all very friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Such opulence without being over done : [u'location', u'sea']
Have seen kids eat in the kids club : [u'overall', u'culture']

Only takes half an hour : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
For the price this is certainly not the value that one would look at : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We stayed for 5 Nights in May 2011 for my brothers wedding and it was just perfect, the wedding was beautiful, the rooms were incredible balinese style and the views everywhere were amazing : [u'room-experience', u'view']
The dining rooms offered a very good selection of options to suit all tastes : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']

Other than that, highly recommended hotel! Should stay a minimum of 2 nights to truely enjoy! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Very uncomfortable and even dangerous if you loose it somewhere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The refrigerator in the room didn't work well either, the drinks were warm : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']

It has traditional architecture being one of the oldest : []
Maybe ask for a room away from the pool and restaurants if you really want absolute quiet : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Very clean,secure,good quality shops and restaurants : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff were non intrusive and efficient : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Why are they at least helping the environment and picking up the trash????? Not a cool move Nusa Dua! I also noticed that the waiters by the pool/ beach/ bar did not recycle their bottles : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
excellent facilities, serene and calm ambience and all too friendly and courteous staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was clean and comfortable, the bed was huge! : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
The minor noise during the day that you could hear coming from construction activities on the new resort being built next door did not bother us at all : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
But poor hospitality to local (Asian) guests : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
So much choice : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
it was a 2 mins walk to the pools and the lobby : []
Facilities exceed expectations : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Don't forget to get your picture ahead of time as they do not allow your free professional portrait to be done on the day of your departure : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

Large spacious rooms, clean bathrooms with excellent appointments : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
If wanting a meal a little cheaper hope on the bus which goes every hour and head to Bali Collection but remember the bus does not go at 12 and 6 as its meal time : [u'location', u'sea']
Had a couple of beers at the bar by the beach (where they do a happy hour pizza for next to nix) and then a magnificent dinner right on the beach with a brilliant young guitarist setting the atmosphere : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The beach was great to lay out in the sun or get into the water (the wave break is over 100 meters from shore, so very little tidal action, great sand, etc) : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Rooms could do with an upgrade but still very good : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']

You have to see the squirrels in action - they scamper up trees and balconies and leap from one poolside umbrella to another : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I think we were quite lucky to get sea view room without even requesting it : []
I don't know why, but the UK doesn't seem to be in a financial crisis! : []
We had a look at these before we left and they are wonderful plus you get all the club benefits such as free 24hr non-alcoholic drinks, afternoon tea and drinks and hors d'eouvres in the evening : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Wouldn't mind to stay there again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel had a great pool bar, lounge chairs everywhere, numerous restaurants to choose from : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
and what i must say-during our one week holidays i've heard about more then 5 cases of money stealing,and finally we fall victim to this : []
I wouldnt want to drive there myself as it is a bit chaotic - with whole families perched on mopeds coming at you from every direction : []
You are truly amazing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
15 min walks and you can eat in Bali Collection or in the Street (I recomended Tropical Restaurant) : []
Didnt have dinner at the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Resort is fantastic and gives a great Bali feel! It sits along "hotel row" and there are other known hotels right next door but this resort was more "Bali" - fantastic spa and service! fantasic food! : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']

A pizza at the restaurant by the pool cost about AUD $12 and kids meals, including room service were about AUD $5 : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We purchased an online deal through luxury escapes that included transfers, breakfasts, spa treatments, and a bunch of other meals and inclusions : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Both very different experiences : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Hotel in general was beautiful, well maintained and laid out, but the service was not as impressive as in the Club : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Also I must mention they were quite arrogant and rude : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The breakfasts have both western and Asian options and are amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Stay futher north and head to the east, west and north coasts for unspoilt beaches and several hundred less deck chairs : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
This hotel was just the relaxing oasis I needed after my energy filled adventure through south east Asia : [u'overall', u'culture']
Back after 18 years - this time with our teenage children : [u'overall', u'culture']
Located near the Convention Centre and tuck within the same compound of the other 5 star hotel such as Westin Resort, Sheraton Laguna, you can expect a good time to rest and relax at the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Their attitude and courtesy was a delight and they are a credit to the hotel ensuring we had all we needed at all times - basically they spoilt us all week with drinks, meals and towels etc : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
And if you want to explore the transport is so inexpensive that any one can afford it : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

The little touches are everywhere, like the turndown service would put a little mat, and a pair of Balinese slippers beside your bed every night, along with a bottle of water : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Quite multicultural too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
(croissants good) : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Bali seems to stop at the guarded gates that lead into the Nusa Dua area where everything is safe and pretty much manufactured : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The guest room is very comfortable and spacious : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I will return!! : []
IMO, prices should be at least 25% cheaper : []

Ok, those the less than good things, : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Brilliant place for kids and families : [u'overall', u'culture']
All in all, I prefer the isolation and the Tavern pub just outside the area gates is awesome for local food, 15 minutes walk : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We could be wandering in without any acknowledgement and be surrounded by tables needing to be cleared, or the complete opposite : []
How can be such a property on earth : [u'location', u'sea']
Maguro restaurant is particularly good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

The resort is 31 years old and is well maintained and the has the Balinese architectural design and charm that the newer hotels lack : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We have stayed at other resorts on the beach at Nusa Dua and found this to be the best experience : []

I stayed at Nusa Dua resort for 8 days with my family (5 yr old girl) : []
My wife and I had a very enjoyable 7 day stay in a premier room at the start of September '14 : [u'overall', u'culture']
It's not big but is perfect for a cooling dip after sunning yourself : []
We stayed for three days at this exceptional hotel : []

Everytime we breakfast, well received by the registerar at the restaurant "Wedang Jahe" : []
The rooms are very well equipped and comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
right from the staff to the rooms to the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We found it cheaper to return to Nusa Dua by cab, than leave, as the hotel will try to organise a cab service for you : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Good co-operation from the hotels ;-) Similarly, on the land side of the hotels, the well maintained streets & walkways enable easy moving around inside Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
In general terms, our experience was wonderfull : [u'overall', u'feel']
The staff so kind and friendly : []
Little things like this have put me off : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We booked a Palace Club Suite again but was upgraded to the Agung Suite - this suite has the best views in the entire hotel with a verandah that wraps around 3 sides : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If we had any small complaint of the Nusa Dua it would be no free wi-fi (expected in most 5* hotels) and charge for cycle hire : []
Coordination of people and food were excellent : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The breakfasts and high tea each day are also very good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There is a good choice of restaurant type (and price) in the resort and WIFI is FREE in the large foyer area (just ask and you will be given a code) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Special offer from the Hotel directly highly recommended : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We spent time walking around the many garden areas and taking time to sit in the many shaded areas and read our books : []
We have travelled alot and I think this has to be one of the best hotels we have and will ever stay in hence me really wanting to review it : []
The beach might as well be non existent as when the moon isn't full the tide is so far out, all you get is 500 meters of mangroves with sea urchins : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There is a small kitchenette that we used to warm up food for our daughter and make some tea : []
It could well do with a renovation to give it a bit more shine; and compared to its neighbours, the water area is quite small (though the main pool is nice and deep) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The owners of the resort are some middle eastern investment arms of an oil rich state in the middle east, and they have recently injected funds to re-do the resort : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Very well suited to families with several large pools, volleyball, table tennis and basketball available : [u'amenities', u'gym']
If enabled, I myself will be happy be back here : []
however, All in all this is excellent resort, perfect for relaxing and rejuvenating the soul : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

Rooms were clean and tidy with amenities appropriate and adequate : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Breakfast is included in the rate : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Dressing room was a bit too small for 2 adults : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Breakfasts were excellent with a great variety of choices : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The Palace Club rooms represent good value, the private breakfast is ideal, as the buffet seemed very busy, the variety of food is excellent : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The only negative was leaving this place : [u'location', u'sea']
Chef who was always making time for those guests wanting a moment of his time : [u'amenities', u'patio']
There was free WiFi available in the lobby area but the connection was so bad that is was barely usable : [u'location', u'general']
It was a bit disappointing in the end, we had to wait for a while for check-in, the food wasn't that great, the service at the restaurants was poor (not enough staff to serve all the guests), not enough pool chairs and everybody seems to come very early in the morning to book the chairs yet it says that you can not pre-booked pool chair on the sign : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable with a great atmosphere and the grounds are delightful and beautifully maintained : [u'room-experience', u'noise']

08:30 ish nice leisurely 30-45 minute walk along the beach Boardwalk : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I was quite offended in the pizza restaurant when we asked them specifically to not put mushrooms on they (our son is allergic) they just took some if them off, more cheese on and served them again resulting in that we found the hidden ones ourselves : []
I was also disappointed in the customer service as we accidently left some things in the room which they said they never found : [u'amenities', u'conference']
6 x 1hr spa treatments, free cocktails etc etc etc and list went on : []
There was a seafood BBQ on the beach with fire dancers which was reasonably priced and certainly no shortage of food : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They live 1/2 way around the world from us, and we really wanted to be close (we requested this prior to our stay) : []
It was great, staff very friendly, privacy assured in the wing, although the hotel is just about to finish renovating a whole wing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They do have a free shuttle service on the hour to go to Bali Connection : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

Only problem we had was with the passport which contains your benefits : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Nusa Dua is a more exclusive part of the island, so all the hotels around here are a bit more quiet than Kuta or Ubud : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
You can have as much as you want of tea/coffee/cold drinks all day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Even if is not a "european" brekfast", you can always choose eggs with bacon or another prepared food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food at the hotel was, in the main, very good - particularly the breakfasts and Raja Balinese restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
At the end we could not relax in the room, making sure that the TV was not loud, trying not to make too much noise, amongst others : []
Loved the beautiful buffet breakfast so much to chose from : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We had just come from a 3 star hotel in Candidasa that was by far superior in cleanliness : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I have been fortunately to stay at some of the greatest hotels around the world, I must say the lobby and grounds of the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa are fantastic : [u'overall', u'safety']
There was no exhaust in the bathroom and on asking room service if the bathroom had one they behaved as though i was asking for and amenity only available on "Star Trek" : []
All rating categories referring to the room respective suite can be marked excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
18mts to 63 years, first time for some : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Good family location, but somewhat isolated for active travelllers : []
Every restaurant offered wonderful food and wine with friendly staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The bellboy did not even have a flashlight to shine our way there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room itself was a good size with ample storage, safe, aircon, fridge and flat screen tv but the en-suite bathroom and the terrace furniture left something to be desired : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Overall the hotel & spa is awesome! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I was close to plenty of resteraunts so you can eat in the hotel resteraunts or go out : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Not much to do compared to Sanur for instance : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We have booked a third stay again in a couple months time and can't wait to stay again : []
The one thing we disliked was the tax and service charge to everything we ordered : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
for indian meals visited gateway of india restaurant which the hotel had suggested : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Rooms were nice but not the cleanest I have seen : []

Absolutely, nothing was too much trouble : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
That said, my wife and i enjoyed our stay here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great location with a short journey to some amazing restaurants in Tangung Benoa : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
5 mins down the road we got a Bintang for 1 : []
The staff made us feel very welcome and comfortable : []
The hotel in reality has two major swimming pools, both of which are very nice, very clean and very easy to access and were rarely busy during our stay in the first week of Australian school holidays, the Main Pool has a swim-up bar which unfortunately was quite expensive and in some cases prices were higher than Australia after Tax and Service Charge : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Sure there are cheaper places outside of the resort area for drinks and spa treatments but when on vacation at a resort like this, everything you need is right there : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We got upgraded : []
On our third day we were unwell and we had the hotel doctor come to our room : []
16:00 ish catch the shuttle bus to the Bali Collection (5minutes max) for dinner from one of the 20+ specialty restaurants : []
Stayed here for four nights and it was excellent : []
Some of the other hotels are more luxurious but we liked the atmosphere, staff and overall beauty of this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The club rooms are are on the ground floor and you have your own patio with proper padded sunloungers : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The location is great, is not far from the main gate of BTDC : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
I really hope we can go back there again soon : []
Although the potential was there for a great hotel, it just didn't deliver in some areas : []
All staff was helpful and efficient : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Great location for ambience, views of the sea and walking : [u'location', u'sea']
Can't wait to stay there again : []
he changed it but was obviously annoyed : []
What can we say other than, enjoy your stay, its just lovely : []
We stayed in a family suite which were spacious and clean however the bathroom was tight for a 2 room suite : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Everything was fabulous from A to Z; except suggesting to add different varieties of halal food additional to the restaurants available on the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I enjoyed my stay at Nusa dua beach hotel : []
the location is within "walking" distance (depending who you are) to the market and some restuarants : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
After staying in what cost us $70 per night with clean immaculate facilities to paying $175 per night here at Nusa Dua and areas of the room that couldn't be used is not satisfactory : []
The pool area could do with a little attention as it is looking a bit worn (a few loose tiles, etc) however there is a lovely lawned sunbathing area just between the beach & pools, so you get the best of both worlds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Although we had arranged for bags to be picked up at a certain time, and the complimentary transport to the airport the same, neither occurred, which left us rather stressed at the end of our stay as we ended up running late to get to our flight : []
Our 5 year old loved the kids club, most of the time there were only 3-4 kids in there and the activities were quite varied : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

The resort is beautiful with bars, restaurants, pools and easy access to the beach : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The breakfast buffet had a wide selection of fresh food which was always abundant in supply : [u'amenities', u'conference']
A quick drive from the airport over the new freeway & we were at our destination & WOW what a place : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Excellent value for money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
i hope to be able to promote this as I think it would be very special : []
Close to the beach, 5 minutes walk from the convention center and has great service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Furthermore, we were always encouraged to take taxis everywhere, (spas and restaurants offered free transport there and back), which meant that we didn't really get any clear impressions of what local life was like : [u'overall', u'culture']
After a very long flight, it was very refreshing to come to an beautiful oasis : []
Food and service by friendly staff was something to look forward to and enjoy : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
, not supervised by the parents ending a very peaceful experience after a massage : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Breakfast,afternoon tea and cocktail hour all help toward a really wonderful stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A room service Nasi Goreng was about AUD $8, and a beer in the hotel bar was about AUD $5 : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
No wifi in the room and the wifi in the lobby which is free is very slow : [u'amenities', u'internet']
My only negative was no laundry mat on site or near by we washed our own clothes by hand as the hotel laundry was overpriced for a young family : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
Though the beaches were terribly hot in day time it was pleasant in night : []
And, I had some dispute over the wifi : []
The room has been renovated few years ago but they do need to keep the bed sheet cleaner : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
breakfast was better than before, fantastic variety, especially of fruit : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The room was also kept lovely and cleaned every day with fresh towels and change of bed linen on request : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Beautiful gardens and lots of squirrels to feed : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Getting the shuttle to Bali Collection for dinner is highly recommended unless your budget is unlimited though! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
We checked in very early in the morning : []
Not a good start at all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Whilst the breakfast bar and buffet were overcrowded the rest of the facility was great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I like jogging, so when I found out that pavement that lies accross the hotels on the beach, I'm so happy, and I ran 10km from south to north back and forth : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Taxi fare from hotel to airport $25 US which is a rip off : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Finally took that long awaited break, excited to lap up luxury and get absolutely spoilt : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Simply Amazing accomidations,staff and service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The pools were great with plenty of deck chairs : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I was also impressed by the very speedy and effective repair of the in-room electricity that was cutting out intermittently : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Am currently staying in Nusa Dua Spa in Bali which looked fantastic in the photos on-line : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The staff are friendly, breakfast is a little like being in a zoo with tourist trampling everywhere : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Its nice at Nusa Dua for families much quieter and laid back than Seminyak : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Wi-Fi - Unfortantely Wi-Fi is only available in the Lobby/Reception for FREE : [u'amenities', u'internet']
It has what the other nearby hotels don't, a traditional Bali feel, evident through the hotel's lovely stone architecture, beautiful rooms with carved doors and furnishings, fragrant, colourful gardens and very friendly staff : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Feeding squirrels in my balcony was an every morning delight ! : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Upon arrival, you may be given a complimentary drink voucher, it is a nice mix of juices, but is non-alcoholic : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The Spa was excellent and pricing reasonable : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
A coke from the street was 70c, at the resort it was $4 : []
We experienced excellent service throughout Indonesia : []
It's so magical here I've called my husband and told him to book a flight for next week with the kids 7 & 9 and come over, that way I can get another week here too! My female friend and I are certainly coming back and it would be a still be a relaxing pleasurable holiday with the family here! : []
Room service was open most of the time and the food was quite good, although was the same price as an Australian hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Price is acceptable and the Hotel has lovely gardens : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The grounds of the hotel were like a park : [u'overall', u'safety']
Besides all these wonderful surroundings and facilities, I was expecting professional, highly competent staff especially when if there is unexpected problem : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The beach is private and had very little bother from the small amount of authorized local sellers : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We would stay there again but Nusa Dua itself is probably too quiet for us (although it definitely suited our R&R needs on this holiday) : []
The hotel is located in the 5 star area of nusa dua and has direct access to the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Rooms are well used and worn but aceptable,on the otherhand the bathroom and shower clenliness was not acceptilble, we had lots of mould on the shower walls and floor annd asked the house keeping dept to come and clean on several occations untill we felt they were acceptable but not excelent : []
Only thing we didn't like was the bathroom : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Easier to walk and have beautiful view if you have meeting in several hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And yes, the best part of the holiday beyond the property is the staff : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This hotel is a bit oldish so I would choose another one if I had to stay in the part of Bali again : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
All restaurangs are excellent including beakfest : []
Every morning of our 8 night stay I would watch the iguana swim in the pond with the enormous sized fish, very tranquil indeed : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
From that first moment until the last moment when we left we were treated so very well : []
We had a session of yoga on the beach which was a fantastic start to the day : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We haven't even finished our holiday here yet and feel compelled to write something! We are having the most beautiful, relaxed time : []
You get to understand many of the ways of keeping cool in a rtrpical weather zone and this is what had stopped me from spreading my Asian wings I will be forever grateful to all staff and my husband in making our holiday once in a litime dream come true : []
If you go to the Nusa Dua area (outside the gates) most resturants will give you a lift home F : []
It's therapeutic just to sit by the pool, near the beach, in the gardens, or listening to the beautiful singers in the evening by the bar : []
It was close to the Nusa Dua market and the Bali Collection Shopping area and we did not need to venture far from the hotel for anything : []
Our only complaints would be that the rooms are small but none the less well appointed and there is no WiFi available in the rooms unless you pay for it although it drops out frequently : []
Prices are reasonable : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My daughter liked the sandy pool so much : [u'overall', u'culture']
You can take a Bluebird taxi anywhere in Nusa Dua and Tanjung Benoa for $3 AUD - don't limit yourself to Nusa Dusa hotels for dinner - try the restaurants in Tanjung Benoa - excellent food at Bumbu Bali and The Tree - lots of others to try - also the Bali Collection offers quite a few restaurants to choose from : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We had to stay in that room for one night : []
The breakfast was just OK, but I love the surrounding of the restaurant, they have a beautiful and big fish pond : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The view from our balcony was like a dream (gardenview rooms) : [u'room-experience', u'view']
We will definitely come back to this hotel one day - the staff made us feel very welcome : []
If I stayed without children I would suggest a Deluxe room as these are on the ground level,have a little front porch and go straight out to the pool : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Our room was spacious and very well equipped : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The only choice is the business center which is soo slow and what's worse they have "free" wireless in the lobby but it is so bad and the entire population of the hotel is huddled around it that it can take 40 minutes for an email to open! Only about 10% of the rooms are even sea view : []
The resort is perfectly fine if you are expecting the usual Bali fare; but definitely NOT a 4 and a half star experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort structure is very Balinese, you can have good background shoot : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed in a standard room and thought it was well fitted out : []
This resort and location is ideally suited to the more mature traveller and requires a taxi trip to reach shopping strips or nightclubs : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Apart from a few language breakdown moments and one evening when the service seemed to be run by trainees, everything was most enjoyable and I would stay again : []
We weren't sure what to expect from the Palace club but it had everything you could need, breakfast was fresh and plentiful, afternoon tea : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Great place for a beach rest : [u'amenities', u'patio']
For me it was a different kind of holiday but I still enjoyed myself : []
This hotel is a great choice if you want to relax at a beautiful beach and being served by the most welcoming staff you can imagine! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Other points - the rooms are serviced daily, there are minimal mozzies around (which was a huge concern for us), decent wifi, lovely staff (Ratih in guest relations is just wonderful) and a kids club that our 4 : []
Quiet area compared to Kuta, Cheap watersports on the beaches : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
It's sometimes hard to get up at 0630, but if you can get down to the beach for the sunrise, there's something quite special about it, you can even join in a sunrise yoga session if you fancy it : []
They had added some lovely touches to our room as we had advised in advance that it was our honeymoon : []
Thank you, Kim and Rod Venaglia : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The palace club was a fantastic oasis, you must try the scones with jam and cream served as part of afternoon tea : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Plumbing and aircon all worked as they should : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
A free shuttle service is provided each hour to a local shopping center which has clothing, foreign exchange and convenience stores : [u'amenities', u'conference']

The ambience is also quite and relaxing, for those who looked for an oasis for a beautifull relaxing trip, this is the place! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
No way is this a five star hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Many of the other hotels we had a sticky beak at seemed to miss the point that you were in Bali - some were very bland and westernised : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The service and the staff at the Palace Club remain impeccable : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The resort is spacious and well maintained : [u'amenities', u'pool']

The prices in the resort for drinks and meals are more expensive than outside the resort but not exorbitant : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
However, it was a good stay there overall, no, I was more than happier, because I was too careless that I dropped my purse when I checked out at the Palace Club Lounge : []
Staff are incredibly warm, welcoming and delightful with nothing being too much trouble : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We needn't have worried - the staff were lovely, and our deluxe room, and the other amenities were all more than adequate : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

Only downside is the slipery-ness of the floors in the guest rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
It was a great modern room, and yet so comfy, just feels like home : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
It is fantastic place : []
Drinks by the pool could be cheaper as I would have had a lot more of them : []
Wide King Bed, comfortable mattress, great terrace/balcony : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Had a very comfortable relaxing stay and thoroughly enjoyed it : []
The best part of the entire stay was the breakfast : [u'amenities', u'conference']

We particularly enjoyed the beautiful breakfast area and comfy bar lounge : []
The fact that this hotel has been here for many years is a positive rather than a negative : [u'location', u'sea']
To the hotel's credit, they do mention this when you book (via Travelocity or their website), so it's no surprise : []
Mr Keni and Mr Ronda are excellent drivers) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Going on to prices - everything is a tad on the upper side I : [u'amenities', u'patio']

See you in August : [u'location', u'sea']
The food, drinks which are included in the Palace Club are very good : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
You have to do trips, the best one was a 3 in 1 day package we did - (bali adventure tours) bike riding through the heart of bali mostly down hill so really easy, stoping of to see different places, then of to ride the elephants had a tear in my eye they was amazing and very well looked after, then white water rafting was incredible, we will never forget it, amazing day : []
We are actually on our 4th day here and every day brings more of the truly devine Bali care and attention to detail : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
they asked on our check in 160 USD for guarantee! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
- The resort is very big which requires a lot of walking between rooms and the various facilities : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The beach is not as expected, if you want to do water sports or snorkeling, better go with a tour to another island : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They situated not too far from the Nusa Dua entrance gate, but quite far from the Bali Collection mall, where you can get more restaurant options beside theirs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bring a bottle of spirits duty free, have some ice delivered to your room, and buy mixers and Bintang at the market and have your own happy hour on the beach to keep costs down : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

Though the staff was friendly, many didn't speak English very well : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Geoff Clark, the executive chef and the head of the culinary team : [u'location', u'sea']
I had booked this hotel online after seeing its good reviews though most of the hotels in bali are having pretty good reviews : [u'amenities', u'internet']
For a little bit extra we stayed in the palace club rooms, which were clean and tidy and beautiful view of the gardens, they also offer a wonderful breakfast afternoon tea and cocktails every day : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
staff were extremely freindly,food was fantastic and palace club room had everything you could want : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are very large with balconies (although mine did not have a bath) and again the rooms mix old with new, the roof had a traditional balinese painting, but yet did not scrimp on modern comforts : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The hotel itself has a large swimming pool that caters to different groups of users like children : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were particularly helpful and attentive and could not do enough to make our stay more enjoyable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Love the hotel atmosphere, environment and beauty together with the upkeep of the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We found the standard of food on the buffet dinners underwhelming : []
overall good facilities but : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel is perfect and service is great! Can not imagine that there is a better holiday in this area : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Only one thing that we found was at the time as Australians the food by the pool is quite expensive, we paid about $55AUD for burgers by the pool one day my husband nearly died!!! : ) : [u'overall', u'culture']
Staff were very good : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Get a room that opens to the lawn and pool : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All staff in the club were very caring and helpful, particularly Nona and Nyoman : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Free Wi-Fi is provided in the lobby area but it is quite slow so i would recommend using the business centre to quickly take care of emails etc and then get on with your day : []
But the hotel was at a very high standard : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
After 14 years we returned to stay at the Nusa Nua Beach Palace Club and absolutely loved every moment of it, again : []
We dined at all of the hotels restaurants and every one was delicious : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']

This hotel is more on the expensive side, but the hotel is great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I signed one drink bill as 0 cos I used hotel credit to pay for it but I got charged on the statement : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
A comfortable hotel with traditional design nestled in one of the best location at Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There is a supermarket, local craft market and a variety of restaurants as well as the usual designer type outlets : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The palace club gives alot of advantages such as great breakfast, partiatly a la carte and buffet, tea time and cocktail time : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
They were going through renovations during our stay near the pool area but we were not disturbed at all : []
we stayed in hotel for 4 days : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We had 3 children from 4 months to 7 years, stayed for 8 days and loved it : []
You can eat dinner right on the beach which is a gorgeous thing to do but pick up some insect repellent from the shop first because there are little sand flies or something that can be mildly annoying once the sun goes down : [u'location', u'sea']
excellent place to recharge the batteries in style and enjoy the culture and relaxed atmosphere of an excellent resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Been to many countries, This is defiantly the WORST EVER : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We requested breakfast to be bought up to the room on the day of the wedding and it was all chosen from the breakfast buffet and was no extra charge : []
Lunch and dinner menus are very western and I imagine Balinese / Indonesian meals are light on the chilli! Breakfast is well worth having, lots of choices covering most bases, western, Japanese, Chinese, Indonesian etc in a lovely setting beside a small pond of water lilies : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
A walk along the beach showed a number of superior places to stay and research of rates proved these to be more desirable places to stay : [u'location', u'general']
-good eco property but do take note of the running animals may scare people especially children ie monitor lizard : [u'overall', u'culture']
the other trip was horse riding along the beach which was 1hr dive,you were there for about 2 hours,then we drove a further1hr to get to the elephant ride,it was busy and what we didnt realise that you were fed there too,so we had a meal first looking over the beautiful forest scenery,we had a 30min walk on our elephant,you could also pay for an hour,you are asked if you would like your pic taken,in the pool or with the trees only costing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Ate in the hotel lots but also visited other hotels nearby : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
As center is way too expensive, would rather suggest to go out of Nusa Dua for the actual shopping spree : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
There are the exersise facilities then abundance of areas to just chill out : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
There is also the Bali Collection which is a 10 min walk but during the day which can be quite hot, we caught a taxi which wasnt much at all : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The beach is not as nice as others : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Language is the major problem here because although the staff speak English, general communication including trying to resolve difficulties or ask for anything out of the ordinary is terribly frustrating : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
sorry we have travelled everywhere in the world and my wife wors in the hotel industry and rhis hotel is very overpriced! : []
My wife and I at least (we came with her parents) will almost definitely return to this hotel again : [u'overall', u'culture']
Has the best beach strip in Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
thank your to all at this great hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Old Nusa Dua is also just 10mins walk which is a small market with more great places to eat : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The vehicle security checks at the outer boundary of the hotel grounds were appreciated : [u'overall', u'safety']
I have never seen a pool this nice in a long time : []
Also watch out for the tide : [u'location', u'sea']
We stayed in a Palace Club Suite : []
Staff was very welcoming and accomdating : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The only thing I would say is don't got to the beauty saloon as their attitude sucked needless to say we did not give her any of our business : []
Selection of meals is varied depending what you want try Raja's for a nice night out at quality restaurant with Indonesian food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As an older couple who spend more time in the room than most people this was bitterly disappointing for us : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Being my first trip to Bali I can say I had great time and returned with good experience : []
Gardens were lovely : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Relaxing luxurious tropical paradise : [u'location', u'sea']
The hotel resteraunts are excellent but a bit pricey for Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Our first neighbours liked to watch TV until late and again from about 5 am, which was annoying as it was clearly audible in our room, however, this is no fault of the resort and they checked out after two days before I bothered to comment, so meh : []
The kids had fun, going from beach to pool and back to the beach again the whole day : [u'overall', u'culture']
All in all we had 8 days at the Beach Hotel and did not want to come home : []
The spa is also fantastic although expensive : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The two pools were great, although we struggled with the temperature, it was quite warm; but this was the same issue with our previous accommodation in Legian, so we assumed it was due to the warm/humid weather! : []
Bed was comfortable with nice and very firm down pillows : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
There is do much to do there we ended up spending more time relaxing at the hotel than exploring the city : []
We stayed here as part of an internet package deal which was very good value : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Wonderful place to chill out : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I was at a week-long conference in Nusa Dua and chose the ND Beach Hotel primarily for its proximity to the conference venue : []
The staff are exceptional and dining is a fantastic experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The whole experience was perfect : [u'overall', u'feel']
Great value : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is absolutely excellent and worth the money : []
Thank you , I really appreciate that : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Check in was prompt and easy, we were shown to our room & the bell boy/man explained how to work everything in our room which was great! Amazing TV selection (not that you spend a lot of time in the room), the room itself was great! One of the best we have stayed in during our 5 trips to Bali : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It had a private balcony overlooking a beautiful manicured lawn : []
Definitely will stay here again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We stayed in the palace club rooms so we were entitled to breakfast, free afternoon tea 3:00-5:00pm, free cocktail (2 hours 6:00-8:00pm) and free juice and soft drink throughout the day and night (24hr/7) at the palace club which also has free internet and is where i am typing this now : []
Thx for upgrading my room to palace suite : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Restaurants - could benefit from having some daily specials, just to give some variation : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I spent my honeymoon in Nusa Dua, Bali : []
all i can say : []
2014), which was conducted in the quiet gardens of the hotel near the duck ponds : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Only down fall is how expensive everything was : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staffs were also very attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I try massage at so many hotels and countrys, this is the worse : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The pool area attached to the spa was a welcome retreat from the bustle in other areas : [u'location', u'general']
We have just got back from a 7 night stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa, which we thoroughly enjoyed! The resort was fantastic, the staff were awesome, nothing was too much trouble : []
We have actually pretty good experience in visiting different exotic countries, but Bali and Nusa Dua Beach Hotel are beyond comparison : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We were delighted when we arrived and it made a wonderful end to our holiday : []
It was also the most expensive meal I had in Bali, and as mentioned I had stayed in 2 other 4-5 star hotels previous : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The hotel in itself is very charming : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
And when we arrived in Nusa Dua, it was the perfect finish of this holiday : []
I hope I will have a chance to come back again : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
no internet in the room! 5 star hotel and we paid extra! redicous! : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The cleanliness and maintainance of the entire Resort is definitely of high standards : [u'overall', u'safety']
And, when you want to get a good taste of Bali, Nusa Dua is not very authentic : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We did eat a couple of times at the italian restaurant and chess bar : []
yes, it is a big resort but not too big as hyatt or ayodya : []
I read some good reviews on the pizza, so I thought I'd try it : []
Didn't bother shopping or eating there : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
- You could get a little lost walking around because the grounds cover so much space : [u'overall', u'safety']
We upgraded to Club Lounge which I thoroughly recommend for the small extra charge : []
Mr Nyoman Padma was particularly helpfull in making our stay memorable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They also give u vouchers to use to discount food and drinks : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There are several top class hotels along the strip, the Nusa Dua being in the more Balinese traditional style : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We spent most our afternoons by the spa pool as the sunbeds by the main pool where always taken, i did try on a couple of occasions to find beds at 8am but found towels everywhere with no-one on them ggrrrrrr : []
I know this is Asia but we didn't experience the same in other hotels : []
I would definitely recommend this hotel for families & anyone else looking for a beach resort experience : [u'overall', u'feel']
Staff so helpful, many have been there for up to 20 years! I was shocked that the hotel is 30 years old! It is in excellent condition : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Again, you may be able to get cheaper massages on the beach or outside the hotel, but the experience would not be on a par : [u'overall', u'feel']
Initially booked Deluxe room but was upgraded to Palace Club room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for 8 nights in July : [u'location', u'sea']
Great beach location, friendly staff, helpful management {offered late checkout-6 pm} Can't really fault them : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Not helping matters, both of our credit cards would not work and we were forced to put almost all of the Indonesian Rupiah we had on the room : []
My wife had a fall on the trip (in Kuta) and injured her shoulder : [u'overall', u'culture']
pools galore for varying age groups : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I stayed in this hotel for a week-long conference at the conference centre a stone's throw away : []
Had a lovely stay in this beautiful resort with 3 friends in a room for 4 people which is basically 2 adjoining rooms but much better value than booking 2 separate rooms : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We went there as a group recently including two guests in wheelchairs and booked the accessible rooms (they have a twin share and a king as well as an interconnecting room if you are taking personal support with you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All in all the holiday at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was most enjoyable and I would have no hesitation in recommending it : []
fabulous hotel if you are looking for a relaxing holiday, away from the hustle bustle of Kuta/Seminyak : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As for the package, it is impressively facilitated especially given 600 to 800 guests being there on the same deal !! The spa is wonderful, the setting is beautiful and the small lap pool is perfect and never busy : []
We had a romantic seven course meal on the beach in the evening which put the cherry on the cake : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Chess bar staff very helpful advising me of alternative restaurants outside of the resort as I didn't want pizza (sandros) kebabs,burger and chips (beachfront) and no reservations left at modern Asian : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Thanks for a great stay and we will be recommending you to anyone who asks! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We found only one problem and that was the length of the hairdryer cord did not allow you to use the mirror : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Highly recommend for honeymooners and familys : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We will definitely come back, and have been recommending it to all our friends : [u'overall', u'culture']
i like the hotel, room, pools, the ambience and many more : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
- pillows are very nice, the bed for my taste a bit to hard : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
The pillows in our room were the best I have ever slept on and would love to source some for home! 18 of our family and friends all stayed here for our son's wedding which was held at Uluwatu : []
Other than that it is quiet and serene : []
We love this beach resort second year we have stayed there : [u'location', u'sea']
Complimentary afternoon tea, nibbles and cocktails in the evening, with complimentary tea, coffee and juice throughout the day : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Its better to walk out a bit from the resort and catch a blue bird taxi from there which is on a meter and a lot cheaper : [u'amenities', u'conference']
thank you all for a great holiday, will be back as soon as possible! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Will be back later in the year : [u'location', u'sea']
We only had an issue with noise one night- but with one call, the front desk took care of it : [u'room', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'conference', u'elevator', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk', u'post-room', u'checkout']
All the therapists do an excellent job but the quality of the Spa facilities could be improved : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thank you for making our holiday memorable : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
I did expect my room to be more luxurious as they are a little tired and run down in that department : [u'amenities', u'internet']
You will not be disappointed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resorts main pool is small in comparison to other resorts which have mutliple pools, but nevertheless suitable : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I knew that the rooms at NDBH had been remodelled, so was looking forward to seeing how they looked : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We managed to get a table looking out at the garden every morning and the service was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
5 out of 10 : []
We only have two drawbacks; : []
The themed dinners were really special and enjoyable, and my children especially liked the fire dance on friday night : [u'overall', u'culture']
We tried most of the restaurants which were all very good with regard to food and service : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I guess some people are just impossible to please : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Lovely staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The hotel has everything you need, and Bali collection is very close for other restaurant options : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Couple of minor complaints: the pools close down at 7 pm (not sure why) and the concierge was not very helpful in helping use determine restaurants to go to in the surrounding area : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Everything was perfect! Quiet and clean rooms, helpful employees, clean beach, delicious dishes : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Taxis are easy to get when you arrive and very cheap, go with the men in the blue shirts there called blue bird taxi : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
only local wine : [u'location', u'general']
They were very accomodating when we complained that the noise bothered us (gave us a bigger room, no hassle) : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
The disappointment was the staff, hence why I would not rate the hotel 5-star : []
Hotel has hourly shuttle to the Bali Collection and the choice of restaurants and shops will keep you busy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Nusa Dua is in a really good position for reaching any of these hotels and for a nice walk to the temples on the small islands : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The hotel is very nice, beautiful, spacious, clean with very good facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

We received no special treatment for beig honeymooners and upon check in to our Palace Club room we were greeted by a very strong damp smell coming from the bathroom and balcony area : []
They had opted for traditional Balinese bridesmaids and music, it was a really unique and lovely service : []
Suastika on reception was really helpful : [u'amenities', u'banquet', u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Our only disappointment was the over pricing of food and beverages at the resort, also some of the menu selections were not good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We enjoyed our second time at this hotel on picturesque grounds which are fastidiously maintained and with great swimming at the pools and very clean beach : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Been 2 yrs since our last visit to the palace suites and some of the staff still remembered us!! I think i have our super blonde son to thank for that : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Management were also friendly and approachable, and willingly engaged guests in conversation through various social functions : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This resort is unbelievably beautiful : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We stayed at the Nusa Dua Hotel for 3 weeks and it was fantastic! We had our wedding there and everything was perfect! The hotel made sure we had everything we wanted and we had a evening reception meal for the guests down at the beach and it was amazing : []
You can make yourself a cup of cappuccino or latte, you name it, just by a touch!! Amazing! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Renovations taking place at hotel should be disclosed to potential guests : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
My wife and I stayed here four nights back in October : [u'overall', u'culture']
We have been treated like VIP's since we arrived : []
00am, we were able to leave our bags with the concierge and make use of the hotel pool and other facilities until we needed to leave : []
Drinks are expensive as per usual but hey pre dinner drinks back in the rooms followed by after dinner drinks on the beach using our own drinks makes it a pleasant affair : []
The room was lovely and the chess bar was great : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The security to get into the area (gates, guards, opening trunks, etc : [u'overall', u'safety']
We feel like we have arrived home when we get out of the car at the reception to "our resort" : []
Because the property is so huge can take you 10 minutes to walk to your room from reception, therefore not a joke when your key card doesn't work and you have to trek back to reception (happened more than once - a day) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The reception and all areas of the resort are very vice and well set out : [u'amenities', u'banquet', u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
That was a shame as it's pool was the only one open till 10PM : []
The room had nicely stocked Mini Bar,Electronic safe in working condition, TV, Phone line for International calls(though we had problems calling using our credit card : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed in Palace Club Room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The restaurants are of very good quality and offer great value : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Overall our experience was very good; however, the management needs to greatly improve their beach safety facilities - there are NONE : []
Was travelling with my daughter aged 1 : [u'overall', u'culture']
Golf is also down the road if you feel the need to dust off the clubs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The squash court is also great and being able to play with staff is also good : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Its family friendly although there were only a small number of children at the resort so it was generally quiet especially when compared to some of the other Nusa Dua hotels that are not ! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Especially in the palace club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Food was good at restaurants especially the fish and the beach Restaurant had a nice atmosphere right on the sand : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Day Spa was definitely a treat and worth a visit : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
But I think this is an important thing these days : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Specify that you want a taxi-metre and the bill drops to USD 1 : []
If you can do the Palace Club its terrific : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food was good with plenty of choice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The hotel provide free afternoon tea to guests of Palace Club but the choice is somehow limited : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Paying the extra for a palace club room was good value, especially as food & alcohol in particular was expensive for Bali : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Bali is a once in a lifetime trip : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Also, with such an excellent outlook over gardens, we were unable to sit on the outside chairs due to mould etc : []
A lovely way to end the holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Plenty of great dining options within the hotel and Nusa Dua is only a 5 minute walk : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Free WI FI Internet, lovely pools and great buffett breakfast : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Restaurants were excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The hotel provided all that was required for an excellent three day break : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
At Nusa Dua, we were reminded everyday that we were in Bali because of the design of the resort : []
Our room, which was one of the standard ones, was on the third floor (lobby is on the second) and had a balcony with chairs and table overlooking the on-site temple, and a pond with ducks that arrived in a line each morning : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just arrived home from 7 nights in the Palace Club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Overall lovely experience went with 2 adult kids outdoor sporting & diving activities were fun,would recommend deluxe room for 4,reasonable & very comfortable with enough privacy : [u'overall', u'feel']
Will certainly be back, just not soon enough! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
beach is great, semi private and not crowded : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The hotel charged us 80,000 rupiah for a 3 minute drive : []
The restaurant food was great but we were a little disappointed in some of the theme night dishes : []
It was crispy on the outside but soft inside : []
The massages that we had were fantastic and the staff were very friendly and nothing was a problem : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food at Chess is very ordinary and the menu badly needs updating : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The breakfast is good and you can find everything from pancakes to fried rice and omelettes made-to-order : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Came in at 1230pm, was told that the room will be ready by 2pm : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I'll be back to this hotel : []
The staff could not have been more helpful and the breakfast in the club lounge was great : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I had a lovely room (think it was an upgrade) : []
The spa also very good and look forward to staying withyou again next year : []
my kids love it : [u'overall', u'culture']
We ended up staying at a different hotel for the remaining time in Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Wow I wish we were still there! : []
Our son had to visit the doctor at the clinic whilst there, and he received a lovely bouquet of flowers and a follow up phone call- it was a really nice touch : []
The room was a bit far from everything but clean and cozy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Best part of the Hotel is the relaxation inspired by such wonderful staff, the worst part is that you are paying for this level of service and this translates to everything you do in the vicinity : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thank you and we look forward to returning next year : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff were friendly and welcoming : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Beautiful hotel in fantastic location : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We found the spa pool much nicer however the water was quite cool : [u'amenities', u'pool']
This is purely personal preference : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We first stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel in February 2014 and enjoyed it so much that we went back in July : []
The breakfast buffet in the open basement and close to a charming fishpond is substantial and exceptional : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Management were extremely helpful and most supportive of a medical problem : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
They are not minimalist and stark : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
One year ago, On 17th Sept 2012 we got married here, just the two of us, at this fantastic hotel & it was a perfect day from start to finish : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Since our last visit the hotel has rolled out free WiFi which when completed will be available throughout the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
would return and mention to friends : [u'overall', u'culture']
Hotel was great but would have been nice to have a better start : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed in a ground floor room in the Agung wing, near the pool (room 1138) and the room was lovely, with easy access to everything : []
Overall a wonderful experience, we will be back! : []
A week we needed a month here : []
- As it was a family resort, there were a few issues with pool space, i : [u'overall', u'spacious']
The canapes varied from caviar to sushi to char-grilled kebabs and many others : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
I would probably say the only disadvantage of the hotel is that you don't see any sunsets : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was more suited to our needs - quiet, relaxing, not-intrusive and more old-school Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
All in all the resort is lovely and most staff great, spa offers great massages and wraps (again included in package) and the local villages are not far to walk, the Bali Collection is close and the resort offers a regular shuttle bus : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Four night stay in first week of March 2012 : [u'location', u'sea']
There are only a limited number to choose from though : [u'location', u'sea']
we needed a break and it was the perfect place : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We have just arrived back today : []
The room is quite large for the deluxe room, and can fit 3 people with a terrace fronting the garden or the ocean (opt) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Same applies for the bed sheets; they were substituted only if you ask for it! You can even see the spider nets in some parts of the room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast were fabulous : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
This one only had a bathtub with the shower head built in on the wall : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I stayed two nights around Christmas day, and enjoyed it very much : []
The staff and management are clearly sincere and friendly in their individual and collective desire to serve the guests : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Grass around the pool and down to the beach was incredible, it was so soft - like walking on carpet : []
There is nothing around except more expensive hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Not a hotel I`d go back to, but not terrible : []
pool and gym are really good : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Nice hotel with a good location and friendly service : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
One big thing for improvement: Almost all pool beds are being "reserved" in the morning by egoistic people that put a towel on it and go back to bed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Have to agree with others that they need to spend money on more maintenance; the pool especially needs a good scrub as there is lots of black mould below the waterline : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
These are: 1) laundry service is astronomical! They will charge per item and the cost can range from $2 for a pair of knickers to $15 for a shirt : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The live band playing CCR's Proud Mary with traditional Indonesian instruments was a memorable highlight of an enjoyable and relaxing holiday : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There was no doubt in our minds that we made the perfect choice in accommodation : []
I was not prepared for this and was a little frightened at first due to the tragic tsunami : []
Aircon worked well and the bed was very comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
The beach is not clean though and you cant actually go in the sea : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It really is a gorgeous resort : []
Very serene and romantic place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
These kinds of things express how warmly you are welcome : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
-My friends enjoyed their spa treatments : [u'overall', u'culture']
No wifi (paid or otherwise) except for the immediate lobby area which gets overloaded very easily during breakfast because since there is no wifi anywhere else everyone tries to do their surfing at the same time in the morning : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We could rate the restaurants and bars as average : []
Rooms: We were lucky enough to have an upgrade so got a double room (two rooms with a door cut out in between), when there were only two of us : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The beauty of the hotel and this sort of extra assistance really helped us to salvage what might otherwise have been a disaster : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Everything about the resort was lovely the interiors, the decor the grounds the setting : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Staff are wonderful & extremely helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Our complementary breakfasts were delicious : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
A bit of lucky stroke that my bedcover were lying down on the floor right in front of the crib to somewhat cushion his fall : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
For convention participant the lack of free WiFi in the rooms is a clear minus : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We stayed in a deluxe room for four days : []
As always plenty of people who put down towels and then dont show up till the afternoon : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Thankyou to all the staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This was the second time my Wife and I have stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach : [u'overall', u'culture']
We had a three night family stay and really enjoyed the experience : []
Although a bit old, the hotel is still being maintained in tip top condition : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Have a rest when you want and go hit the slides again : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beaches always clean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast cannot be faulted and over all the Pool and Pool area are excellent : [u'location', u'general']
Staff were efficient without being intrusive and the dining facilities and food were excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Very relaxing place with friendly staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
A tip, watch the tide, low tide not suitable for water sports : [u'location', u'sea']
We decided to have breakfast in the main restaurant as the coffee was hot and you got a full cup, you also had a much larger choice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hotel surroundings, garden and beach well kept and lovely : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We had wonderful stay, everything was perfect, the place is such a luxury to stay : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However other than breakfast the food is OK but not amazing but we did enjoy a couple of meals at the neighbouring hotels (The Melia do the most amazing Sunday brunch - unlimited food including lobster, steak, seafood, foie gras etc for 420,000 rupiah +tax) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
I could not get enough of their Ginger Tea, good things it was there for compliment because I loved it so much haha : []
There were numerous water features that brought about a feeling of serenity : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Terrible service as 4 : []
There is a few restaurants there which looked nice and clean and a Starbucks too : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This hotel and their staff are excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A can of diet coke is charged ten times of price of it in the shops : []
Power plug in room did not work : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Over all the hotel is a beautiful gem with some need for fixing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Laguna Garden restaurant in Nusa Dua is great, excellent food and value and free transport : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
rooms are veeerrryyy nice, the people entire bali are very well behaved,staff are good to talk cooprative, understanding : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
What we didn't like was having a room with communication to the next room, something than can be solved easily : []
10 PM, a hotel staff knocked our door while we were still packing and said "Why you haven't leave yet, sir?" I was very disappointed, I knew that we should check out at 12 PM, but it is very rude to said like that to guests, come on it only 10 minutes past the suggested check out time and the hotel was not crowded at that time : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We find this hotel as our sanctuary : []
I found the atmosphere excellent, staff was very polite and always helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We booked our own transport for a day trip to tour Bali as the hotel transport was more expensive : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff are very helpful and always helped when we needed anything including taxis : []
HOWEVER, the staff at the breakfast area and around the poolside area were so nonchalant and rude, that sometimes you didn't know whether to laugh or be exasperated : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
stayed at the deluxe garden view room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Didn't go into Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
When we looking for a honeymoon destination, we wanted something aouthentic : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
All in all a lovely relaxing holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I really love stay in this hotel : []
we arrived around 1pm after a transfer of about 20 mins from the airport : []
Supardmi, are both exceptional but all the staff in the club are so efficient and professional they always go the extra mile, they truly are an asset to this resort : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The room we stayed in was reasonably sized with a small bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We could not fault every aspect of the holiday : []
20:00 ish nice leisurely walk back to the hotel along a well lit road or alternately along the beach Boardwalk for some fresh sea breeze air (about 15-20 minutes max) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Breakfast was amazing for Bali standard : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Yes the meals were cheaper than those at the hotel, but the quality of the food was in no way comparable to hotel meals and the service was non-existent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This hotel was by far the best choice! Maybe it's not that polished and new as some other near by but has special kind of energy : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Nusa Dua is a specially designed part of Bali for resorts : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The only complaint was with the bed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
Nusa Dua area is an excellent location : [u'location', u'general']
Especially the Indian night : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
I was pleasantly impressed with this hotel : []
- Hotel can arrange a Taxi to take you or pick you up from airport; price based on USD : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
we liked the older style of the hotel which was reminiscent of the old Bali : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Scary faces looking down at you whilst you sleep (artwork - some may like this, our two year old daughter didn't) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Try to get the water from the mart outside the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
What a HUGE disappointment, and may I say a RIP OFF : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel grounds are beautiful : [u'overall', u'safety']
There's such a relaxing atmosphere, you felt as if you at home, but better : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Manager was very accomodating and made sure our holiday is improved and not wasted : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Food is eatable but not the quality and variety you can get at other resorts and restaurants (and for cheaper) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The complex is huge and luxurious, so if you really want a tourist resort holiday, there's lots of swimming pools, and a beach area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were the most friendly we met in Bali and all happy : []
The food was lovely and the amenities were great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The grounds go on forever and we decided to hang around the property most of the time : []
The food we paid for (lunches and dinners) seemed really reasonable to me and was always lovely : []
The buffet breakfast is to die for : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The hotel grounds were lovely and the grand kids loved feeding the squirrels : [u'overall', u'culture']
The manager is from Dublin and Danny is a fine man with a superb sence of humour : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
That being said, the hotel is amazing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For #2 I'll go to Bali Connection to eat : []
Thankfully we had a free upgrade to the Premier room from a deluxe room but this only made a difference in terms of space : []
The hotel could do with some decent musical entertainment in the evenings : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The furniture was chipped and scratched, the terrace furniture cushions heavily stained and the bathroom had not been updated for many years : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Yet, being such a small island, nowhere is far from Nusa Dua, so day tours to pretty much anywhere on the island are possible (although a week in Nusa Dua and a week in Ubud would allow you to see and experience more) : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
One hour later fruit basket and two glasses of bubbly arrived : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
And, it's Bali so the staff were extremely friendly and helpful : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We are so please to be able to recommend the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
Asian food through to dohnuts and local fruits : []
Vouchers are a little tedious but worth the trouble- very good value : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
If you're going to Bali to experience the try culture etc then this hotel may not be your best stop : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our children love this resort as much as my husband and I : [u'overall', u'culture']
The hotel is absolutely wonderful and welcoming, rooms excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It probably wasn't the right choice for us, and we'll definitely try an alternative accommodation next time in Bali : []
Try Bumbu Bali ,Sakala,& Tao (at the Radisson ) all in Benoa ,just a short cab ride away : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Nusa Dua is a secluded area, where you don't get to see much of Bali, so next time I'll go, I will stay in Ubud or closer to the nightlife of Kuta : []
Kids play area (isolated and abandoned) : [u'overall', u'culture']
From checking in, requesting another room which was immediately granted (no fault of the hotel), the pool, the restaurants, the food, the rooms and room service, the beds, the setting, the quiet music at the pool / lounge / bar, the service - and not the least the smiles at all times - it was a great and very relaxing experience : []
They looked a bit fresher : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Clean rooms and rubbish whisked away, which when you are shopping is a bonus : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Even though this hotel is one of the older ones in Nusa Dua it is very well maintained and charming : []
An excellent international class 5 star hotel with all the amenities you would expect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
(A group of mountain guides have an office at the bottom of the mountain : [u'amenities', u'conference', u'recreation']
Overall we had a great time at this hotel, we stayed in the Palace Club Suite and had the privilages of Breakfast, Afternoon Tea and Evening Cocktails : []
We had eight nights at this resort and was made to feel welcomed from the moment we stepped out of the transfer car into the lobby : []
Also dust bunnies accumulate on the bedsides : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
The open lobby and choice of food was very good : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
On seeing our room, we first requested a room near the pools but the one available did not have a very great view so we settled for our earlier room and I think that was a good decision : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They were very pro : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Which including heaps of extras : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We received hotel offers to use Santi Lounge for our meeting on November 2012, however we were not really satified towards the meeting room because it seems the room originally not built for a purpose of meeting arrangement : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The room was a bit buggy, even for the region : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Room is nice and big 1 bedroom unit : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The rooms were not very big but were very clean and very well maintained : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
First time at NDBH and it was great : [u'location', u'sea']
The grounds are beautiful, big and exquisitely maintained : [u'overall', u'safety']
The property has a wild cat that wanders the hallways : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was perfect : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
0 in the morning : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Bathrooms came with rainforest shower facility : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
good yoga classes : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
more clean : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Good and clean rooms : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
It will be excellent when this is done : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the gym was small but enough, the recreational place that supposedly has games for kids was nt even working & they only had 2games : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The theme nights were excellent : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The hotel looks very promising and manicured but in reality a lot is missing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
From the entrance all the way through to the beach the grounds are just fantastic : [u'overall', u'safety']
Sugi picked it up and kept : []
I don't know, but the minor complaints I've noticed people mention here, I haven't even noticed : []
fresh salad : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Ok so you could get cheaper drinks outside the hotel and people do comment on that well coming from perth where a cocktail can cost up to $25 we found everything reasonable ! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are several bars / restaurants to choose from and the quality of food was great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
We also enjoyed a few of the pizzas on offer at the pizza restaurant : []
For 15 dollars you can rent a gazebo on or near the beach which is also great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We requested several times for a pull out bed to be in room and it was not in room when we asked for daughter and kids playground not working when we arrived : [u'amenities', u'garden']
we did look at some of the brand new hotels on the strip but they could have been anywhere in the world the NDBH is a lovley little piece of bali : []
Drinks were well priced throughout the hotel, and babysitters are available (something we didn't make use of enough) : []
Enjoyed every moment of our stay, with the staff, location, facilities and ambience of the hotel making our stay very special : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pool was beautiful and clean and the beach was also nice enough to swim in and warm : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Yet, on returning this week with my husband I can still only give this hotel 4 stars because there are two many lapses in staff professionalism and the F&B offerings in the Palace Club fall short of what one expects from a 5-star hotel in Nusa Dua given the competition : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Once I produced the original offer, the staff were happy to provide what was stated : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I had my reflexology massage near a little fountain, the sound of the water and my relaxing feet luuled me into sleep : []
I enjoy very much the beach : []
The room was very clean with fruit basket and the smell of jasmine filled the air : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Beautifully landscaped, clean, and inviting : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Some people have said it looks a bit tired, but I think that is just the style of the hotel, a lot of wood, Balinese style : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very well and nice staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food is fine, drinks cost HEAPS, staff are gorgeous : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Found the new toll road a great way to get to see the sights much more quickly than in the past : [u'location', u'sea']
I learnt few easy and engaging ways to feed my kid : []
Service is superb, food is excellent, room is excellent : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The breakfast is unbelievable- hands down the best I have ever had : []
Staff can be found regularly cleaning, serving, helping guests, gardening or maintaining the resort : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Also stayed at the Bali Water villa 4+5 in Ungasan which is the most amazing place I've stayed in so far, yes out did the Evason Phuket!! see my other reviews :) : []
The hotel grounds were lovely with ocean views and a lovely breeze : [u'overall', u'safety']
the palace club package is great if you like to eat and drink! All the restaurants are great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel is definitely not at a 5 star rating : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There is no stress here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All our queries were answered promptly and cheerfully : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
great pools & beach area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
-Beach area is clean, quiet, well kept : [u'location', u'general']
My husband and I just returned from a five day stay stay at The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'overall', u'culture']
This resort retains a lot of Balinese heritage and charm compared to many of the newer more "Americanised" venues that surround it so it depends on what you are looking for on your holiday as to weather this is the place for you or not but we think things like the large Lizards wandering around the dining area, squirrels on the room balconies and the wonderful local staff make this hotel our first choice when we return : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Pretty large pool for the adults, with a number of smaller pools for the children : [u'overall', u'culture']
An advantage of older refurbished hotels is space : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
the pool area was fantastic and was separated from the white sand beach by a sprawling open-air restaurant : [u'location', u'general']
would return there in a heart beat : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They are friendly, very polite, have a great sense of humour, helpful and so eager to go above and beyond to ensure guests are well taken care of : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Room was great with everything we could want and if we needed anything it was clattered for with super speedy service : []
If guest stay more than 3 days, hope that the management comes complete with WIFI as complimentary : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The room is really clean and privacy, staffs are friendly and helpful : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Also it is only a 10-15 minute walk from Bali collections where you can enjoy hassle free shopping and great food at the many restaurants( but the hotel also has 5 ) in a clean environment and the international hospital ( for peace of mind ) and golf course are literally across the road : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
the restaurants are very priced : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
There is a program of activities and you can be as active as you want, which suited us : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Altough Nusa Dua is relatively far from shopping center area (Kuta, Legian), I really enjoy my business trip by staying in this hotel : []
The property is huge with different sections based on your needs : [u'room', u'furniture']
Great pool, great location, quick walk to beach clubs, cab rides to ubud, easy to find transport in or out of resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Has a true Balinese touch : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The hotel restaurants do have good variety and sometimes entertainments such as singers and bands : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
this hotel is very good for family : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Loved the pools - like warm baths : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The spa facilities were heavenly : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A huge Jaccussi bath in a modern luxerious bathroom with fantastic seperate walk in shower and seperate toilet : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
the hotel has very nice breakfast and nice facilities! Nothing more than that!!! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Good food, surroundings are kept up to scratch every day, squirrels are amusing, I can only complain about one aspect : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
This was my 5th stay here and it just gets better every time I stay here : []
The ground are immaculate however the room and personal courtyard was looking old and unclean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
As long as the doors remained closed, the rooms were absolutely perfect : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
What can I say but we will return : []
We had our wedding party stay here (50 Guests) and it was great : []
There were two chairs on a rather squashy balcony which were a bit grubby and often wet from heavy showers : [u'amenities', u'conference']
But this is a mute point if all you can hear all day and even after 11 pm are angle grinders : []
But this time, it seems that the crib does not have safety standard : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Overall though we will likely go back wiser and look forward to another relaxing holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The only negatIve point was the internet: no free wi-fi in the rooms and the connection in the lobby (where there's free wi fi) was terrible : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Just returned from our second visit : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
I would recommend this resort to singles, families or couples - it is accomodating for all : []
And we didn't get any compensation, just apologies : []
Keep in mind that you will be forced more or less to the high prices at the hotel restaurants : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- Access to the beach is easy and good to do relaxing : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Certainly not something you find from most hotels in Bali (for instance- try the Westin next door) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So much to do when it does anyway : []
We chose the Hotel as we had spent part of our honeymoon there 25 years previously! Obviously we were concerned that things would have inevitably changed over the years but it was all for the good! We were greeted with smiles when we checked in, and shown to our room which was very well appointed with a lovely view from the balcony : []
We arrived in at 1am from Perth : []
We had dinner which was poor quality and over priced : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Went to Bali from 12Jan to 18Jan14 : []
Large and lush swimming pool shaded by palm trees, lots of activities either for adults or kids : [u'overall', u'culture']
All in all I couldn't really be bothered to review this hotel is was so mediocre, however wanted to stop other couples making the same mistake we did in booking it! : []
anything you need will always be helped by the warm and friendly staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel never seems crowded : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Some things at the hotel make you scratch your head, for example the hotel has a great breakfast buffet spread, yet you have to scramble to find your own table, search to find your own high chair, you aren't offered any tea or coffee and if you aren't randomly asked halfway through your breakfast and ask a staff member, they seem confused and need to be asked 3 or 4 times before doing anything! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
A little complain: The "congee" rice soup was good on the frirst day, but then it : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
During our trip Hotel had several big groups, 100 people's dinner, lunch, waeding, several and often sametime, we "normal" tourist at beach and elsewhere didnt much notice these happenigs, so very well kept and arrange, didnt disturb any activities, so smoothly that if ever need meeting and celebration service this is a place, or new weading :-) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Toilets were not cleaned to a satisfactory level : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Tons of facilities, bikes to hire, and staff everywhere offering to help : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Next time I would like to try laguana and Westin : []
The music in the lobby bar was first class : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
Food was average - I thought : []
The hotel is quite a walk to the village so I would use this more for a few days beachside / poolside break rather than a base to see and explore everything that Bali has to offer : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Beachy pool was cute : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Gardening is exceptional! : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Special mention to Dermot for making himself known and sorting out my small passport issue with the number of beers : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
And it wasn't a new age funky open shower concept : []
Room is spacious and comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I feel the hotel needs a staff member at reception who speaks and undrestands the english language so they can communicate with there guests : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We visited for two weeks before christmas : []
Booked through a company that had advertised the palace upgrade as adults only, but it was in fact a place children were allowed : [u'overall', u'culture']
I had 2 excellent balinese massages at the SPA : []
Great and safe location, attentive staff, and awesome grounds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was our First trip to Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
3) About $15 for Wi-Fi that the hotel would not waive! They recognize this is a problem but they have a contract with a third party that has to run its course : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Otherwise excellent location, great price and great staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is immaculate and well maintained and leads onto an amazingly beautiful beach couldn't fault the location or cleanliness and the food although a bit dearer than outside the resort was amazing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is clean, peaceful and feels really romantic! I recommend walking along the beach around after 9pm :-) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Comments , photos ,great nature ,traditional Balinese style made me focus on this area : []
We also enjoyed our private swimming pool which is very discrete and not visible from other guests : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The bedroom had t : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
The staff were so friendly and attentive throughout the resort, nothing was too much trouble for them and the food was outstanding, each and every night : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Free wifi is available in the lobby area : [u'amenities', u'internet']
A calm high quality hotel in a beautiful setting with very charming and helpful staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We stayed in a Premier room close to the beachfront and pool which was lovely : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Although the room was a little small it was always cleaned by lunchtime and suited us as a couple : []
They smell a bit bad : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Back then it was the only hotel in Nusa Dua : []
Cons: I have been to 2 dances the kechak and legong dance, both of them don't have voice : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
this resulted in my partner getting quite rude with them which proved necessary : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The breakfast was amazing and the omelettes are a must to try : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I came back after my breakfast & another assistant manager told me that it can't be refunded cos my friend paid $100 upfront for all the kids meal : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
A beautiful prisitine beach, swim up bar and poolside restaurants made life easy and relaxation easy : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
If you'd like to eat off resort let me recommend a restaurant called Tropical : []
We also took advantage of a massage and facial at the day spa which was also amazing,but again probably around the same price as Australia : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Food & drinks were very pricey at hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
One night we did have amazing service at the International restaurant though! : []
We stayed in three deluxe rooms with two being interconnecting : []
we couldn't tear ourselves away from the beachfront! : []
We went in October 2008 and the weather was glorious : [u'location', u'sea']
I sit at the bar overlooking the ocean and ponder what it is I love about this Hotel : []
The Chess bar and Majuro's are great restaurants - the Theme night buffets weren't so good, but the theme night shows were great (balinese dancers & Kecek dance) : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
The pools were superb and were the highlight of my childrens' holiday : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
i really like garden and breakfast resturant and has a good outdoor pool and lobby was really nice and warmly : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We stayed here 4 years ago and loved it so much we booked in again - (2 adults and 2 teenagers) for 5 nights in a Deluxe room for 4 : []
Nusa dua is a quiet area so wouldn't suit people looking for heaps of action : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Quite a few of the pool towels need replacing and the pool lounges could be a bit cleaner and balcony furniture could also do with some regular cleaning : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'conference']
Thank you for a great holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Would like to thank the event manager Kadek Dwi : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
The rooms were clean and spacious and serviced appropriately : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
There is a shopping arcade there but its all fixed price and expensiveThe swimming pools are very nice and large and the grounds are gorgeous, especially the huge lobby and breakfast area : [u'overall', u'safety']
They said that's because the rooms are connecting : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
After our experiences enjoyed here it is now not feasible for us to return to anywhere other than the Nusa Dua area when next we stay in Bali : []
The honeymoon suite is huge and luxurious with a dining room (including a cappuccino maker), living room, bedroom, bathroom, and powder room, with a furnished double balcony : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
And there is a kids club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
We were looked after very well here - really enjoyed the amazing choice for breakfast every morning , the massages were awesome and the pool bar was a treat : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Did have dinner at one outdoor area - Chess, but not sure on the food, had Nasi Goreng and quickly followed up with a dose of Bali belly, even after taking Travelan and using hand sanitiser meticulously : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Premier room location only have garden view there was no ocean view for premier rooms : [u'room-experience', u'view']
Each day began with the most delightful buffet breakfast served by genuinely friendly and gracious staff : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The cocktails on the drinks menu are worth a mention too; packed with fresh tropical fruits, they are difficult to ignore! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
unforgetable honeymoon : []
Trying lots of new foods during afternoon tea and cocktail happy hour is a great experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you are willing to live a truly Balinese style - do not hesitate going to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pricewise, from highest to lowest would be L, W, Nusa2beach, then M : [u'location', u'sea']
For breakfast we could have anything we wanted - freshly made smoothies, boiled eggs, pancakes : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
This continued for 1 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The mirror for the basin is installed on a sliding door which is not realy working : [u'amenities', u'conference']
See you soon : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We felt like we were treated like royalty : []
Pools are OK but a bit shabby, with loads of noisy kids : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I also overheard another guest remaking on the lack of sauce on her cannelloni : []
We waited for 2 days for it to be corrected : []
side restaurants weren't bad : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
This time I took a massage session at the Spa - very professional, very relaxing, and excellent surroundings : []
Facilities were great and staff were extremely friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We met up with our Australian family and young grandson for our yearly get together holiday : []
Breakfast: Plentiful with a great variety to suit all tastes : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
One of the most beautiful and comfortable hotels I've been : []
We got the room facing the central stage area at 1st level : []
What I liked the most about pools was the depth up to 2 : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The driver will take you anywhere you want to go : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You can walk along the beach and get to the main area in 15 minutes or so but the beach promenade is only partly paved and a bit dark at night in places so best to take a torch (hotel supplied in room) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
BUT, don't get stuck at the hotel pool everyday -you can do that at home! Be sure to get out and see BALI while you're there! Hire a driver (only $40 US dollars for an entire day! and have them take you to see traditional Balinese temples, the Monkey Forest, go river rafting, ride elephants and go snorkeling : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel is too good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It was an excellent tour, very informative and good value : []
The Hotel itself is one of the first to be build at Nusa Dua but you would not know it was 20 years old, it adds to its charm, it is well established & the landscaped gardens, pool & balcony growth as gorgeous : []
Having two main pools was good as the swimming pool by the beach could get a bit crowded at times : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
the breakfast had a decent spread of choices : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The food is bland, sadly so with wonderful fresh ingredients and spices this was disappointing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pools were lovely, clean and well serviced and supporting staff great : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Need to pick up used towels from pool area when guests leave : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This is our second stay in the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was our 6th trip to Bali, having been to Kuta, Sanur and Ubud previously but this was our first time to Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For us personally, I am glad we didn't take the Palace Club option, whilst it looks beautiful and the tranquil duck pond side of the resort is gorgeous, we prefer a little action and "people watching" and found the pool side to be a little livelier whilst not being too busy or noisy at all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We will defenitely come back! : []
The staff are nice, room was great ( they upgraded me even though i had already paid a great price) : []
The noise from slamming doors started at 6 : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
Stayed here with the whole family for a whole week : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Nusa Dua is a great place to stay any resort along the beach there would be pretty good : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We did struggle a bit with suppers as we are vegetarian and there are very limited options to choose from : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Had prebooked hotel transfer through my organizers, it was roughly 20-30 drive from Denpasar Airport(Nearest International Airport) : []
So there were no shortage of eateries : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This was absolutely worth every money and luxury : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
myself and my new wife have just returned from paradise ! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only negative was the dirty towel and bathrobe in our bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
They only have wired in the rooms and the cables don't work for newer computers : [u'amenities', u'internet']
A fabolous Red Snapper and superb tiger prawns, verz simplz grilled on wooden fire : [u'location', u'general']
Despite being quite busy, it never really felt crowded : []
We really love Nusa Dua region , totally different than Kuta : []
Beach is safe and picturesque - just a bit ratty several hundred metres south close to the Nusa Dua headlands : [u'overall', u'culture']
I stayed here in 2011 and the resort made a mistake by giving us a one bed room versus two beds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
, was really great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Palace Lounge was excellent, witht one of the best marinated salmons I ever tasted : []
Breakfast buffet was ample with good quality : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Although older and maybe more worn than some of it's newer counterparts (it's 30 years old), the hotel retains more Balinese charm and for us was a far better choice than some of the more sterile (and expensive) brands further along the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It is a big hotel so walking is required : []
The Duty Manager explained that the person cleaning our room had found our safe unlocked and open - he walked back to the room with us to check all was well - it was : []
The pools are fantastic, the gardens beautiful, access to the beach easy and the staff were absolutely wonderful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Hotel cleaning staff cannot be better, polite also laundry service worked very well and for us it was also reasonable price : []
The only thing that marred what would have been a perfect stay was the fact that I got a smaller room than my sister (my room had no bathtub, hers did), although we paid the same price : []
The other facilities were well mantained : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We only left the hotel to go to the water park & we also had a wedding so we can't comment on the area : []
The staff is attentive and helpful in general : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I would have liked to see a sports bar in the complex as I kept going back to my room to watch the tennis : []
This must be one of the most amazing resorts that we have ever stayed at, hence the reason for it being part of the "Leading Hotels of the World" : []
Our honeymoon was in Bali and we spent 4 wonderful nights here : []
The room stank : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Couldn't have wanted anything more : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel has a relaxed feel and we felt comfortable at this 5 star hotel with our young children : [u'overall', u'culture']
The grounds and pool area are fantastic, buffet breakfast amazing & staff wonderful : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Cocktails in the evening, breakfast in the morning, afternoon tea/snacks and service with a smile at the palace club is worth the extra : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
Service was sometimes slow : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Food is too expensive and not very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The food is great although a little limited re the menus available re the package but the quality was great and the kids menu went down very well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Great location on Nusa Dua beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Because of this we had a large balcony which was great to sit on at night and have a few drinks - don't forget spray for mosquitos though! The bathroom was clean, there was a shower over the bath and a toilet in the bathroom, outside the bathroom was the sink : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Far North Queensland : [u'location', u'general']
The food was fantastic, the rooms extremely comfortable, with the beds and pillows out of this world! We have not slept like that in years!!! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Hotel facilities were great, although rooms were slightly small : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The location is great - thank you for a relaxing holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Overall the resort is excellent with real Balinese character : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is old world charm : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Plus: Nusa Dua is like an island to the rest of Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
a long time after a long flight : [u'location', u'airport']
There are two huge pools, especially designed for families and young children in mind : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The hotel itself is stunningly beautiful, it is as close as you could get to living in an ancient Balinese temple-palace : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A highlight of this resort is the wonderful pool bar - does life get more relaxing than sitting on a chair waist deep in water enjoying a beer or cocktail and simply plunging back for a swim to cool off every now and then : []
Overall, a great stay that is highly recommended : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast buffet has a huge range of options, covering every taste : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I was very worried about coming to Bali, but after arriving at your resort, I felt totally at ease : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
The spa area had a great 30 meter, two lane lap swimming pool in a really tropical environment : [u'location', u'general']
Bicycles for rental : [u'room', u'furniture']
Other guests would put towels on them early in the morning then only come back in the afternoon : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
My girlfriend and I spent 5 days in this wonderful resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
(We look forward already to our return ) : []
There is a shuttle to the Bali Collection, which a shopping area and also has many restaurants, but you can walk here also : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, you can find many options of recreational activity provided by the hotel and local area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was not as expected : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The kids club was great, our spa treatments were perfect, all our meals - whether the breakfast buffet, poolside menu or restaurants - were fantastic : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They were building a large wooden structure in front of the beach (noisy by the way) that could be nice when finalized : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
What we got was normal check-in at 2pm, a room on the second floor, no view to speak of, with some noise at night from the entertainment in the restaurants and not too close to reception, but not the furthest away either : []
The electrical switches didn't coordinate leaving no option but for the bathroom light remaining on all night and having to put robes and towels and the shutters between the bathroom and bedroom to keep the light out : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
There is also a free bus to shopping centre called Bali collection : [u'location', u'airport', u'station']
We had our two boys in our room in rollaway beds but we had a seperate living area for after hours which worked so well : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Based in Nusa Dua, we got the best of two worlds : []
The shop in the hotel sold soft drinks however they were also extremely expensive (they didn't even sell ice creams) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Aircon was good apart from it didnt seem to switch off : []
Being a fan of Nusa Dua, I've been looking for the winner across the beach line : []
An incredibly warm welcome, excellent service throughout and all staff are incredibly helpful and attentive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Make my kids happy of course : [u'overall', u'culture']
They rooms are lovely : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Was all we had hoped for and more : []
I stayed for a conference for one week in November 2014 : []
The island depends on tourists for their economy and its dog eat dog and when walking taxi drivers always stop and ask to take you where you are going : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed for three days and had a beautiful time, the staff was so courteous and very warm : []
The rooms come with bathrobes, slippers and umbrellas, there is also an electronic safe which was perfect for us : [u'amenities', u'conference']
00pm for cocktail hour : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
As other reviewers have mentioned the resort is somehow old but perfectly maintained : [u'amenities', u'pool']
This will be the main reason for our return : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We thought our Luxury Escape package was great value but advertised as a 2 adults and 2 children deal you need to supply a bed for each person : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I cannot speak highly enough for the attention to detail , the attentive staff and organisers, the photographer, all staff : []
Fantastic staff and service always eager to assist,we absolutely loved this place : []
The general area is safe, but a bit dull : [u'location', u'general']
Would definitely recommend Nusa Dua Beach Hotel as an excellent family get away : [u'overall', u'culture']
Great place to stay, a very couple/family orientated hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The setting and gardens are wonderful and the pools are excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The location of the hotel is excellent : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Our room was spacious (standard room), and it was cleaned twice a day : []
A nice breakfast was served daily : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
On the back of the swim up bar is the kids pool, which means you can be having a beer watching your little ones! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hopefully it won't become an over priced tourist trap but as it stands it's still a beautiful Island with Beautiful friendly people : []
We were at the beach end of the resort so the long treck to the spa was not an option as it is at the front of the property : []
Spa was delightful : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
It tastes quite bad : []
We returned as we were given 5 nights free bed and breaksfast in a Royal Club room due to a few lets say minor issues on our wedding day : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
We will return without a doubt : []
The room was situated at the back of the complex, took us ages to figure out how to get back to reception or anywhere else from it, but, for one night, we knew we wouldn't have a prime position : []
The range of pools and spa facilities kept us all very busy : []
A group of about 30 of us stayed at the Nusa Dua hotel : [u'amenities', u'conference', u'recreation']
The breakfast buffet was extensive and appetising, catering for guests from various cultural backgrounds; only criticism would be the lack of tea and coffee staff circulating at breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
WC door many times locked : [u'location', u'sea']
It is located on Nusa Dua beach amid very large gardens : []
Nearby shops do overcharge vs normal parts of Bali - they cater to "wealthy" - so catch a taxi to buy at normal prices : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Very picturesque, but a warning to parents of small children, it is still a body of unfenced water! : []
The small restaurants around the pools are fast serving, delicious and at a great price : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach for 5 nights in Feb 2012 after previously getting married there in Jun 2010 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Dinner: We tried Chess Restaurant dinner buffets on two occasions- the satay on the evening we arrived and the seafood BBQ mid stay : []
" EVERYTHING was perfect! I'm going to miss the coffee and juice at sunrise, the amazing buffet breakfast, the pools, the beach with tall cold beer, the lobby bar with Eti, dinner with a show or a special dinner at Raja's Balinese Restaurant, and of course a cool clean room with a very comfortable bed!!!!!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The administration staff cannot sort any problems with accounts at all and checkout was drawn out and exhausting, The wait staff are mostly very obliging - especially the staff in the executive club, you all deserve a big pat on the back!!!! Some management staff (executive chef) need to be a little for considerate of guests when holding loud conversations whilst traditional performances are staged on theme nights, we found this disrespectful to the Balinese culture and rude to paying guests : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Free shuttle every hour to Bali Collection convenient for all shopping & evening meals,lovely ambience : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
Finally, as mentioned, this hotel has a traditional Bali feel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Another key ingredient is the spectacular traditional settings, including the garden surroundings and pool areas, which encourage plenty of relaxation : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Not too noisey : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We got a free upgrade to a family room which was so nice : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Larger room and better amenities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our 3 year old son enjoyed the swimming pools and the food : [u'overall', u'culture']
Resort - Lovely pools and plenty of sun loungers : [u'amenities', u'patio']
will certainly go back again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The rooms are a good size with a lovely bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I also had one of the best meal in Bali at the hotel signature pizzeria, Sandro's Pizzeria, you'll ask for more than you could chew! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were not being taken care of and not sure if we will ever return : []
Will only stay again if the price is right : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Check in and out was excellent at the Palace Club : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
With small kids as well, the lack of milkshakes with ice-cream or iced chocolates was disappointing : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
To see how the staff handled kids made me wish I had taken my 22 month old son with, but on the other hand we had quit and adventurous trip and late nights : []
The rooms have large balconies which lead straight out to a beautiful garden with pond and fantastic trees and plants - a little slice of heaven when you wake up in the morning : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food was also very good with breakfast, afternoon tea and canapes and cocktails served daily : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Though other hotel in the same area include breakfast for two : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The resort is well laid out and suits familys or couples : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Being able to get bottle water all day free of charge as a privilege is such a treat : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
(coming from South Australia we have some amazing beaches & this was a disappointment) We were so grateful to re-enter Nusa Dua & head straight to the beach & calm down : []
How can a 5 star hotel not have free wi-fi in the rooms? : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Service irreproachable at your table : [u'room', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'conference']
Could not recommend highly enough : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Aside from that just relax : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So we got back to the reception and they gave us an upgraded room, which was not only clean and beautiful, with great view, but we could enter the room directly from the beach and pool aria : []
My wife and two young daughters enjoyed many of the resort facilities and had a great time doing so : [u'overall', u'culture']
50 massage I had a flower in the street : []
The hotel itself was beautiful, welcoming and very important very clean! The breakfast was wonderful and the restaurants, especially the Asian one (forgot the name) was lovely : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The combinations of one dishes to another is somewhat confusing : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
In order to get wireless you need to sit in the open, non air conditioned lobby : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I think our total dinner cost us $13 with one beer and one soda! And it was really great! I think I had shrimp with pasta in a vodka sauce! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff at the Chess Restaurant provided a birthday cake for her and sang Happy Birthday to her which was very special : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We've been to Jimbaran and Kuta and I could say this is still the cleanest beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Special compliments to mr : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
The Palace Club was very useful but would be more suited to couples who want to get away from young children : [u'amenities', u'patio']
There was a choice of at least 6 restaurants and we tried most of them, except for the high end restaurant : []
actually inquired about extending the stay but our airline tickets would have charged a big penalty for the change, so we decided to forgo : []
Only way to avoid this was to have breakfast quite early : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
more free activities for kids at kid club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Wonderful staff, room, amenities and extremely wide variety of good food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
This was my third visit to this hotel, and it was like coming home : []
I ran out of reading material so asked if there was a library : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The wi-fi is all over the place, but you need to purchase if you want to use it in the room, unfortunately, the cellular reception inside the room is not good : [u'amenities', u'banquet', u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Simple things like ordering room service or calling reception were next to impossible to get any one to understand : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Not too many knew it was there as most would gather around the main pools at the other end of the resort which includes the childrens pool : [u'amenities', u'conference']
An example of their excellent co-operation was on display when my wife had an accident and had to go to hospital : [u'overall', u'culture']
Stayed at the Nusa Beach Hotel on the 22nd Sept to the 29th Sept,2012 Loved the place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Bedding was comfy : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens', u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
The Bar was a little overpriced, but still it is cool to enjoy cocktail sitting in the pool bar : []
I had to stop myself going back for 3rd and 4th helpings! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I'm not saying it was an awful hotel, it was nice, but the area, meals served, prices and swankyness/removed from Bali was not our cup of tea : [u'location', u'general']
After a million dollar renovation, I was expecting a swanky modern hotel, it was a let down : []
There is also another poolside bar and restaurant which serves drinks and lunch by your lounger! : [u'amenities', u'conference']
But I preffer to keep my phone with me even when I'm on holiday : []
We spent 9 days at the Resort with our Family : []
Drinks and food at the hotel are very expensive by any standard, anywhere in the world : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We had a fantastic time at Nusa Dua for our 25th Wedding Anniversary : []
Thank you to Management and Staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Very Balinese : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The place is clean and every single staff is nice and duty full : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The entrance of the hotel has a huge architecture which resembles a gateway split into vertically symmetrical halves : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We have just spent 3 nights here and was far beyond our expectations : []
Highly recommend to others with young children : [u'overall', u'culture']
I would recommend booking a palace club room as it looked amazing and we were quite jealous : []
Two lagoon style pools in main area plus tranquil lap pool in spa area : [u'location', u'general']
The room we did get was damp and musty - we saw mould : []
Very easy to get a cab out the front to take you anywhere you want to go at a very cheap price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The swimming pools was also clean and comforting, with our baby on his own swimtrainer ring didn't want to get out from the pool : [u'overall', u'culture']
Facilities were fantastic, services were great and staff very attentive : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
All the hotel staff we interacted with were very friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
A relaxing experience with ample space and clean environments : [u'overall', u'spacious']
I think he will be a great manager if not a much higher management position : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Our checkin was fast at the Club Lounge and we were taken to our beautiful room which opened to the gardens only the Club had access to : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
needs more range and high end options : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
A special mention to the BREAKFAST: all you can imagine is there! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
What is known as "the village" is a short stroll out the front gate : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Housekeeping is great with the rooms serviced twice a day and plenty of towels and water : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The Nusa Dua Spa is delightful : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The deluxe double room for four is spacious with the children in an interconnecting room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I unfortunately didn't get to eat much whilst there but what I did have was lovely : []
Our room was a triple that was just remodeled : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff there were very helpful too, as they helped me to confirm our dining reservations outside the hotel and with our driver to Ubud : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
If you don't like the room you are given the reception staff are very good at makin gyou happy:) Go for it : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Beautiful complex and lots of Balinese Hindu influence in the building : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Here you can taste coffee, see the rice patties : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room is very big, clean and comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Was moved to a nicer room later : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We were also given a free alcoholic cocktail voucher to use at the lobby bar : []
Can watch the sunrise, and the on-goings of the hotel below : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
This time we stayed at the Palace Club rooms, wonderful! : []
The facility itself boasts a few different restaurants, two swimming pools, morning yoga sessions, gym, kids playgroups, function rooms etc etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The kids pool is also good for adults and its nice and shady and also deep : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Lovely bathroom : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
First time was 21 years ago : [u'location', u'sea']
We booked a deal through Luxury Escapes for 10 days and up graded to a palace room at a cost of US$80++ per night : []
the rooms are private, clean and air conditioned) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
hospitable staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was 'nice' and the pools were great, having "kids club" was handy (although they could be a bit more creative in the activities they offer for boys!) : [u'overall', u'culture']
It was a best hotel I have ever seen : []
In summary, the hotel is very large with great staff and a nice beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Fortunately we had the documentation and we can only surmise that the staff were confused with our earlier Luxury Escapes package and the most recent one which varies significantly : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel is beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We took family guests with us this time and they thoroughly enjoyed the facilities : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I had the pleasure to stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for some days in September : []
Also, my room was facing another hotel, try to ask for a room either facing see or pool for a much view : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Other guests: Mainly couples in their 50's and 60's or families with young children : [u'overall', u'culture']
Lacks authenticity : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
You have the opportunity to hide away in a secluded paradise or be social with other guests and enjoy the many and varied activities available : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
With a cold towel and a very welcomed fruit juice : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
Excelent service, always with a smile! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nothing is free, its all a con : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
More education to the wait staff and the process please! : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The beach is beautiful and so are the swimming pools : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I traveled with 7 other adult women from California (US) mid Oct 2014 and stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa in Nusa Dua for 2 total nights : []
Overall it was pretty good but I have to admit I have stayed in better hotels : []
This Resort is best in Balinese style in Nusa Dua Area : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Didn't like being pushed to do a review : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We took at shuttle past the newer hotels nearby and most looked pretty standard with convention posters up front and metal detectors like casinos : []
It was so disinterested : []
There are some vendors on the beach but they are friendly and don't pester you too much : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The pools are good for families with children and offer a non-chlorinated pool as well : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Our package rate included a 60-min Traditional Balinese Massage and the masseurs did a good job in relieving our aching muscles : [u'amenities', u'gym']
I was told to return after breakfast, he would see what he could do : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Transport by car from the airport take just over 20 minutes : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The area where the Palace Club was had a park like setting with a large pond with its own flock of ducks : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
) makes the area very secluded but also too isolating at the same time : [u'location', u'general']
I guess it will boil down to future reviews and whether the Summit can manage their staff better as well as price/deals : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Two strong points of the hotel are (i) the large lagoon pools and private beach access (i : [u'location', u'sea']
The room was spacious, with nice large bathroom, mini fridge, usual bathroom amenities, free bottled water : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
the beds were comfy & the linen was amazing, top quality : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Only minor grumble would be the price of drinks : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We had a ground floor room facing the pool which also had views to the ocean : [u'amenities', u'conference']
All in all a relaxing stay and great hospitality! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pizzas covered in raw garlic (which we could not see because one has to eat in darkness) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We found the Customer Service was of a high standard : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Would definitely stay there again in the future : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Once again we sampled everything Nusa Dua Beach had to offer : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Not only do they do a fantastic job, but they go way beyond the call of duty and they did that with me : []
I love the staff who are always friendly and helping is not an issue : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Very beautifull hotel : []
I am surprised by the good reviews the breakfast has received : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel as a good full-service, resort-style hotel -- not quite as nice as the Grand Hyatts and Oberois of the world, but a reasonable approximation for far less coin : []
This was our first time to Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The stuf is friendly and helpul : []
Pool staff generally do nothing all day : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The rooms are spacious and comfortable, beds and pillows are to die for! Good mix of restaurants and bars and the breakfasts are sensational : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Don't worry they haven't been in our room yet but we keep the door closed as you have a choice between having the glass door open or shut and/or the wooden venitian blind door open/shut : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff is friendly, courteous, generous and humble : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Do not stay here for dinner, take a metered taxi into nusa Dua centre : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Unfortunately $100 in lost golf balls for me too, gee it's so hard an so much wind and water : []
Was expecting to have water sports available to use, so was a little disappointed at this aspect : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We would highly recommend this resort : []
however you can either wonder down to Bali Collection or the main road : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They are not permitted to come into the hotel, but are allowed to stalk the tourists on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The staff made our stay here incredible in every way : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
- very boring at night and only a small bar at the lobby with very bad music : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel is very well maintained : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Highly recommended the Palace Club room! Located at the ground floor : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The hardest working staff on the resort are the pool cleaners, I saw one to submerged for the day fixing tiles and making sure the pool was spotless : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The water is very clear on the beach but you cannot swim out very far : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Wecould not fault the hotel ,or service fom its friendly staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Overall the hotel and service was great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
i love it so much : []
Really appreciate it so much : []
The children's pool was fantastic and was under shade for most of the day : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
There is only one really tiny negative thing I could think of ( just so it's doesn't read as too gushy!) and that is the Chess Restaurant could sometimes get really busy in the evenings and then the wait to get a menu, have order taken etc could be very long, but this only happened a couple of times so it wasn't that big an issue : []
One of these hotels is The Ayodya, which is a lovely hotel with many restaurants, but we picked the Waterfall Restaurant for our anniversary meal, which was really enjoyable : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We enjoyed a wonderful 10 day holiday in Nusa Dua, our first stay in this part of Bali after many, many stays on the other side of the island : []
After spending 4 nights in Kuta and Ubud, we headed to Nusa Dua : []
Honestly cannot fault this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We found the staff always helpful, kind and looking if we need something, at least a little chat : []
Our room was clean and reasonably spacious and looked out onto a beautiful garden setting : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
There is a morning room service and a turn-down service in the afternoon : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
He was trying hard to be pleasant, but not succeeding very well : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
At the time of our visit a lot of daytime construction work spoiled the quiet surroundings as the resort is building a new beach restaurant "Tamarind" which looks like it should be open in August - the noise was a bit of a nuisance but we feel sure once this is complete the bar and beach area will be excellent : [u'location', u'general']
The grounds - beautifully maintained : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The gym was also great, compact but with everything one could want for a great workout : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Beautifully located near beach, pools fabulous and spa area excellent especially the tranquil pool! Tennis, squash, gym and games area all added really well to the experience! Very safe, secure set-up : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We stayed for 7 days, was recommended to us by friends who have stayed there many times : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Not for teenagers or young couples : [u'overall', u'culture']
chess bar and restaurant look a bit tired and in need of updating, and the lagoon pool could also be freshened up, but these are minor observations of ours : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Also, the lack of a DVD player in the family room was a bit of a let down considering this is when my husband and I get "down time" from our active kids : [u'overall', u'culture']
the hotel looks good from outside it has all the art of Balinese taste : []
Beautiful hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However even beyond all the things mentioned what topped this holiday for us was the warmth and friendliness of staff always ready to help in any way they could to make the day special in every way they could , very efficient and professional too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the guest rooms are just stunning, we stayed in an upgraded premier room which was very comfortable and spacious : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I have to call one of them and asked for menu : []
The management is aware of the problem, but is not showing any action to overcome this problem : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Our son had upgraded us to this level of service as a gift : [u'overall', u'culture']
Several pools : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The breakfast area overlooks a beautiful garden and the personal chef will cook on demand : [u'amenities', u'garden']
You can see that is not modern but it recently went though a major renovation that made it up : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
5- There are many restaurants and bars next to the swimming pool which making the area busy and unattractive for shy guests : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It ticks all the boxes : []
Staff were wonderful and attentive consistently : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had a great stay here : []
Always irritated, unhelpful and unhappy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
in a Deluxe 4 room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
If you want to just chill on the beach, this is the perfect 'bang for your buck' : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed from 27 December for 4 nights, 2 interconnecting rooms, 2 Adults and 2 Teenagers : []
Although each hotel has its own beach area : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It was fantastic : []
and beverage cost us an average of $30~40 : []
I don't know why people are writing bad reviews of this hotel? : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Rooms were very well maintained and the staff looking after them were terrific : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The staff were friendly, the drinks were great and the location is charming : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Regardless of the exclusive area of Nusa Dua the food needs to be more reasonable : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The staff , each and everyone, are polite and helpful - we were so pleased that the driver who fetched us from the airport made a point of saying 'welcome home' to us, a personal greeting that says a lot : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff are incredibly nice and helpful! : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
aircon pathetic and I gave up trying to get high speed internet after an hour with their contractor : []
Kids loved the tree house - a short walk along the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The kids visited the kids club for a few hours and had a ball there are plenty of organised activities : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Free WiFi in common areas only (which is usual for most Bali hotels) was pretty good : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The package we arranged for the trip through a travel agent was very reasonable : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Very mediocre : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I ended up giving detailed instructions on how we wanted our food prepared after too many fails, at best I can say it tasted little better than airline food : []
The beachfront is furnished with comfortable lounge chairs and there is never a shortage of luxurious purple beach towels : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The spa is a must, highly recommended - you will not find anything better : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In spa area, there is also little pool which is more private and also you can use the whirlpool and sauna : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The perfect destination for a family holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
I was travelling with my mom and my sister and we really took avantage of the pool and beach : []
The restaurant right next to the beach is really good and a pleasant alternative if u want to stay on the hotel grounds : []
awesome pools,beautiful food and friendly service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I am very greatful to the management of that hotel as well as all of their kind staff : []
The beach is nice, though you can't swim in the sea : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Good atmosphere , very good location , good service and very good value : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our third time at this beautiful resort, and it certainly gets better and better : [u'location', u'sea']
We were only available for 3 whole days due to other commitments, so only took one trip out, which cost $45US each to the fire dance at Uluwatu, which was very good : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The spa is also very good : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The facilities were beautiful and the staff were so lovely : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
From the testimony that I read before I go to nusa dua I had pretty high expectations : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel location is tailor made for people to just wind down and recharge your soul : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
too much chilli : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff were just wonderful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
A big THANK YOU to the lovely staff at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
No Brown or HP sauce at breakfast! Sacrilege! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Need for more staff in busy times : [u'location', u'sea']
There are nothing in Nusa Dua, but the weather is pretty nice, whole day in breezy and comfortable : [u'location', u'sea']
We were upgraded to an ocean view room as it was my birthday and we took advantage of the beautiful sunrises and the view of the pool which I loved : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Anyway, for us, it was great, quiet and peaceful enough : []
Nothing was too hard for this hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Be careful as the taxi driver will drop you at his choice of restaurant : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
The sea is just 30 seconds walk away from the pool, and it is lovely and warm : []
This resort made our family holiday a wonderful positive experience and we will b back! : []
With our luxury escapes deal we held our breath and closed our eyes : []
During our stay we also visited the Galleria mall which is a short walk away, or you may use the free hotel transport if you wish : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Everyone had a great time with the kids enjoying the time they spent in the kids club and the ample swimming pool area : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
This is a great property with excellent staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
(even more choice than last time, if that's possible) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We found the pool area here much quieter than the main pool and sunbeds were always available : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Great location with good swimming beach at the doorstep and good service with drinks and food delivered under the trees : [u'amenities', u'garden']
At the end of my stay I got food seek, perhaps a suggestion to the hotel is to include a soft diet : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
Lovely welcome at reception and delighted with our room (2145) which was above our expectations : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The breakfast is good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
- We reserved an outdoor cabana on the grass for an extra charge (Nusa Dua Hotel does not have cabanas directly on the sand) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There were various options for dining in the resort : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I think what really makes Palace Club are the wonderful staff : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Have just come back from an 8 night stay, on a cudo voucher, and could definitely have stayed longer! Travelled with a 3yo and 9 month old : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great value hotel resort - esp enjoyed our extended daily breakfasts in the package : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Breakfast was great with lots to choose from and the food in the other restaurants was good to especially the iced coffees by the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The location is close to beach, Bali Collection and the area is lovely : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
4) the spa is lovely but try and ask for an experienced masseur as my second massage definitely did not hit the spot as you'd expect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
me and my wife hav had the most amazing time over here in nusa dua beach hotel and spa, : []
You can get several miles in within the Nusa Dua area without too much trouble, although it can be a bit tricky to follow it around a few places where it appears to end at fences or buildings : []
I did not mind that there was no internet in our room : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Facilities are really good as well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The balcony (and view) was nice enough but the room itself was disappointing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
this doesnt mean you wont get a bargain though & an hour massage still only cost me 150,000 rupiah (AU$15) : [u'amenities', u'gym']
You will fall in love with the grand and heavenly bed pillows : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You must try the muesli cookies : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Perfect holiday to Bali with our family : [u'overall', u'culture']
It was a lovely relaxing place with extremely helpful and cheerful staff : []
Fantastic breakfasts in a beautiful setting : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
All the other meals we had out and made use of the free pick up service most restaurants provide : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The jack hammer was a little annoying all day though but it was unavoidable : []
The staff did a great job at making sure you were comfortable, : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The gardens are immaculate, this would be the cleanest resort we have ever stayed at : []
The family rooms that fitted 2 adults, 2 kids and 1 baby were average in size, but the bathroom was very very small : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
The bed was so delightful and a welcome repose from busy days : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
But lot of fruits anyhow : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Unfortunately you had to be at the pool by 7am to secure beds which I found disappointing : []
The only complaint is that you have to pay for your room internet : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff at this hotel have been trained to a very high standard and nothing is to much trouble : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The main downside with this place is that there isn't a fluent English speaker who can handle a grievance : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Red carpet private entrance, 2 storey (bigger than our house in Australia), 2 master suites each with their own spa, 5 bathrooms, Offices, huge lounge & bar area, fully functional kitchen, private pool, Flower arrangements everywhere, fruit basket, 360 degree views of the superb beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Food in the restaurants was tasty : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The resort provided a great selection of scheduled daily activities that everyone could participate in : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And with the new road makes going into Seminyak really easy : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The hotel is okay, but it does really not reach any five star standard, as listed : []
The vouchers we received made the holiday affordable : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
I have stayed before and so loved the hotel and spa : []
It is so much cheaper : []
We enjoyed staying here during days of just relaxing and felt it good to come back to after trips on the island : []
Wine was super & unreasonably expensive!!! : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Upon getting a lift to the airport our driver had mentioned how many complaints he had heard from other guests as well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
On arrival we were escorted to the Palace Club separate check-in area, a short distance away from the main reception : []
Security was great when we forgot to lock the room safe the room was double-locked until we checked all was still present : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I would highly recommend the Nusa Dua Beach Resort : []
The big theater and garden area at Nusa Dua mean the pools are quite a bit smaller than the Westin and Laguna : [u'amenities', u'banquet']
We did unfortunately not receive our fast track through customs and immigration as they blamed a third party : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Rooms are lovely only having been recently renovated : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Stayed three nights : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
and the four hand massage after hours of walking in the late evening in an open air room was just fantastic! : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Nuas Dua Beach Hotel was a great experience : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This hotel has beautiful grounds, great staff, excellent rooms, great pools and a beautiful beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Pool is great, beach is clean and close : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We spent one week in Nusa dua at this hotel : []
breakfast is very poor and every day is the same : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Would certainly return : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we have stayed many times as palace club guests at the resort and just love the place : []
There is a private plunge pool, jacuzzi and steam room in the villa for the couple, so enjoy the complete privacy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Loved the nights where entertainment was provided and the spa was tremendous : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
You need to do something about this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff and management are friendly, professional and extremely helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We are planning another holiday to Bali in Late December and I can say with 100% confidence that we will be staying back at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa and will be recommending it to all we speak to : []
We are pleased to report that it was not : []
We had a wonderful time : []
The hotel is like heaven! The pool is amazing & the service around it (and the pool bar) was fast & reliable : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The area is secure and closed to the Bali traffic : [u'location', u'general']
Not a whole lot to do if you are looking for cultural experiences but nice place to lay on the beach/pool and relax : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach although not that picturesque was clean and lovely to stroll up and down in the evening : [u'location', u'sea']
But, the strongest point of this hotel is on the hotel grounds : [u'location', u'sea']
It is the small gestures that count : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Ended up hiring one from Kuta for $4/day : []
We were ripped off : []
I can't wait to see the renovations to the Palace Club when we go back next year : []
Reception staff is very friendly and accommodating : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The choice of drink included: champagne, martinis, frozen daiquiris etc : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Great main pool and surrounding pools : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I spent a little extra and upgraded myself to the 'Palace Club room; these rooms have are very spacious and have a lovely outdoor verandah area which looks out on the extensive water features and gardens : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Large open plan hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Well, I don't know where they were staying but it certainly wasn't The Nusa Dua Hotel and Spa where we stayed : []
Stayed 7 nights in a superior twin bed non smoking room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The rooms are nice but a little damped : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The only negative - there was a bad smell in the bathroom when we arrived but they attended to this issue as well : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The food, especially at the Maguro Asian Bistro and Raja's Balinese Restaurant, was excellent, and I can highly recommend the pina colada cocktail in the Lobby Bar! Thank you again, we will definitely be coming back! : []
Overall we will be sending a complaint to management as this was just such a disappointing experience and we feel completely ripped off : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There is basically nowhere else to go and eat apart from the free shuttle into the Bali Collection shopping centre which had an awful lot of over priced eateries and very expensive shops, like Prada Billabong Polo, all the yuppy stores : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Family room was great but perhaps having the adults bedroom off the main door would have been more useful : [u'overall', u'culture']
The hotel has a true Balinese feeling (which is something a lot of the other hotels nearby are missing) and the friendly, attentive staff and the beautiful, well kept, spacious hotel facilities made us feel so comfortable there : []
Just some minor details to fix : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
There are a number of restaurants and places to have a drink so no need to go outside the hotel if you don't want to, great service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The coffee machine wasn't working : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Definately will be back for another visit : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Good variety of restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
* Get to the pool/s early to secure a lounge : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
Overall, as long as you are going for romance and/or relaxation, i recommend Nusa Dua Beach Resort : []
Lovely pools : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I stayed in Nusa dua beach hotel during in november 2010 : []
The breakfast was very good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The pools are really nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
A special mention here for the food & beverage manager Sinead Moore who made our stay very memorable just brilliant and caring : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are clean and comfortable and our superior rooms had a balcony which overlooked the gardens and ocean : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The general amenities at the hotel are excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
This was our relaxation and it was everything we expected : []
Mostly they were watching TV, so my kids didnt want to go to club as they wanted to be more outdoors : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The room furniture is made from wood, with balcony facing the big pond : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'conference']
Your staff are wonderful and the whole resort is fabulous : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The hotel has many terraces where you can eat and a gorgeous restaurant for breakfast and dinner : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They also have a kids playground, beautiful gardens, beach access and temple to explore, lets just say the kids we anything but bored : [u'overall', u'culture']
But the restaurants were too expensive : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
We had our room made up for three times a day, and yes they refill all the bath amenities so you dont have to worry will run out of bath gel or shampoo : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The top of all the house in bali is like the style in ancient chinese : [u'amenities', u'patio']
- Many restaurant options and the beach as well as the view are breath taking : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The resport is recommendable even if the beach not 100% : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Even if you miss the bus, a taxi is so cheap as it is only a 10 min walk and a 5 minute drive or thereabouts : []
Best hotel have ever stayed at, treated like royalty : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The rooms and grounds were always kept immaculate by the extremely hard working staff : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The Resorts position was ideal : [u'room-experience', u'view']
8 Amazing nights stay- just to relax, and enjoy Bali as usual : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
However quite expensive, best deal is to have the half board : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The rooms was almost perfect, with great air on, effective and efficient bathroom and quaint Balinese style : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
we were taken to our room at the back, garden view : []
The hotel and staff are the best : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A very solemn, quiet, and peaceful to really forget about your daily routine and fall to deep rest : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The staff are friendly, helpful and always smiling : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The gardens were so very beautiful with ponds : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The premises and facilities were so well suited to what we pictured for our Bali holiday, our children enjoyed the kids club and pools : [u'overall', u'culture']
People return to this hotel year after year and although this was our first visit, it will certainly not be our last : []
The gardens here are the best we have seen in Bali and you get a great sense of space Food at the restaurants good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only anoying thng about the beach that is the huge amount of people selling all kind of stuff, they are very persistent and they are there everyday for the full day : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Just give me a final price I have to pay please, especially when that's the drinks list, the menu, the charge to take out a bike or have a spa treatment : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The sliding glass doors open onto a shady patio with outlook across the gardens to the breakfast room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I could not have been happier with this resort : []
The club staff are exceptional, whether it is making sure you are happy with your food to making restaurant bookings and arranging transport nothing is a problem : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It's a beautiful resort, mature & well maintained : []
The atmosphere of the hotel is amazing and the style is contemporary Balinese : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Had a trio band playing covers at the restaurants every night, they were very entertaining : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
A traditional respite in busy Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The staff were rude and not a nice experence at all I will never recemend this hotel to anyone : []
Other areas of hotel were undergoing refurbishment but we weren't disturbed by this at all : []
My advice to future guests not go for the service of airport pick up from the Hotel as it is pricey at $45 for such a short distance from the airport to the Hotel : []
Most times we went on the free shuttle to the Bali Collection (an outlet for shopping/eating) where meals there were a lot nicer and not to mention cheaper : []
Upon arrival we were whisked away to the Palace Club Lounge for check in : []
Great hotel in Nusa Dua, with spacious rooms and beautiful views : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Some of the nearby hotels look great as you enter, but I need more than a good looking Hotel when I choose where to stay : []
The trip to UBUD was also nice and worth to make : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
We felt like we were home here, which says a lot : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The room was just so old and not that clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We all had an amazing experience yet again : []
The other not so positive issue was the price of the meals inside the Hotel comparing with the prices outside : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We tried to use the same lady,but sometimes she was booked by other hotels in the area : [u'overall', u'culture']
There are lots of boutique shops appx 20 min walk from the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The best from this hotel is a long plain white sand beach to enjoy, eyes pleasing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast at club level was excellent, a la carte style for cooked items with a buffet selection of pastries, cereals and fruit : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
It the room is important to you, we recommend going for the Laguna as a preference, failing that the Westin : []
During the entire massage could hear the workers outside! treatment room had mosquitoes so it was a terrible spa experience in all : [u'amenities', u'gym']
But very reliable service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff etc were helpful and friendly : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This was a very pleasant experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
nice food and better poolside bar : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pillows were a bit soft but that is the only complaint : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We would definitely recommend to book the Palace Club room, it is more than worth your money! The complimentary afternoon tea, cocktail hour, great breakfast in the Palace club garden and excellent service are just a couple of reasons : []
I read that most people raved about the breakfast- well it was just ok nothing great to be honest, apart from the fruit selection : []
The Palace Club also had free breakfast (lots of choices), afternoon tea and evening cocktails : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
having stayed in such hotel you expect a high quality internet service not a free wifi in the lobby! the staff are not so warm compared to the other one which we stayed in Bali and not that much friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We upgraded to the club rooms which was well worth it - the private lounge area was great and the added free afternoon cocktails, and all day soft drinks and snacks made it well worth the extra cost (plus the additional space you get in your room) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Bali Collection is 10minutes walk from the hotel (half the price) and the town itself is 15minutes walk from the hotel (cheaper again) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Overall we truly enjoyed all the places we went and the Resort : []
This was a bit annoying : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is definately a hotel that I will return to, absolutely no complaints its just perfect : []
We dined on a number of occasions at the hotel : []
It was perfect and the staff are super nice and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We like the Balinese design and architecture, the location was fabulous, and the food at Maguro and the Raja perfect : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
When will hotel managers grasp the importance of decent, live music to attract guests to the area, set an appropriate mood and thereby increase bar takings? : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The beach though very beautiful was full of floating debris, garbage! this was a total turn-off : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Rooms aren't huge, but definitely comfortable and clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Very quiet, almost like having the beach to yourself : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Fun was had feeding the squirrels when they came to our balcony : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Secondly I had not been advised of all the works going on at the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I would have better traveled to Kuta for more choices of lunch or dinner : []
My wife and I live in Western Australia and have just had a fantastic 8 night stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : [u'overall', u'culture']
All up, we certainly would return again and we would take our children to this hotel : []
If you are in Bali and need to slightly far from Centeral area nice place to be : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is not the best and to be honest we didn't venture onto it once, but as we had recently been in the maldives this may have just been me being a bit picky : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also give the Chess Restaurant on the beach front a miss : []
Go here we would again ;-) a lady called ade in the bali restaurant was such a sweet heart and very helpful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Greaat food, Great Pool, very nice hotel space and relaxing ambience : [u'overall', u'spacious']
We did a local dinner one night at Sharkeys that was very fun and great food you pick out of the aquarium and is cooked for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Everyafternoon, while our 20months son goes to sleep, our 4 year old daughter will go to the kids centre for some art craft activities : [u'location', u'sea']
Staff in Executive club very good : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Finally the wonderful holiday turned rather sour when at checkout, the arrangements were not initially honoured : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
As part of our package we had 6 treatments included : []
The time before this, we stayed at another hotel close by, but returned to this one as we like it better : []
The service at the hotel is superb from every single person : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We would definitely return here : []
Every time we visit we stay in the Palace Club : []
Only half a litre of complimentary water per person : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
mushadi who was in charge of the pool bar who was patient, attentive and generally good natured, also to the staff at chess bar whose service and courtesy is amazing! a few suggestions to the management, would be to have free bottles of water readily available at bars n restaurants and also for the breakfast buffet times to be extended : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The gardens are lush, verdant and relaxing : [u'amenities', u'garden']
It only took tree minutes get a room and what a room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Excellent experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And the coffee, bread/danish and fruit selection was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
Staff friendly, breakfast was the highlight of my day : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The room boy told us it always did that! The furniture in the room was scuffed and worn and one night there was one night too many : []
But too bad the hotel is too faraway from mini-market/convenient store, you need a shuttle bus or taxi to gain access nearby : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On arrival (late at night) we checked in, but when we got to our room we were not happy with what we booked, so we enquired about upgrading and for an additional US$50 per night we were upgraded to a Palace suite and absolutely loved it : []
The evening began in the foyer at 7pm for cocktails, followed by a magnificent buffet dinner & show : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The therapist tho lacks training : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Recommend upgrading to Club room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The breakfast was amazing and we really, really appreciated the homemade granola bars! I had a pedicure done and was sad to find out it had to take place in the dated salon, and not the spa (as the spa is beautiful) : []
Lots of drawers and storage space : [u'room', u'furniture']
The hotel is situated on one of the best beaches in Bali, seawater is beautiful warm and clean and pool areas are great : [u'location', u'general']
Currently, it is sufficient, not 5 star : []
We opted for the upgrade to the Palace wing which we would highly recommend : []
From early morning yoga to watching the sunrise : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The service from all the staff was exceptional and best wished to all the trainees who have been doing work placement at the Hotel - you have great role models! Loved the invitation to attend the General Manager's Cocktail Party - great to meet the GM - Urs and the amazing and very talented Aussie Chef - Geoff Clarke : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel has beautiful facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Underwhelming pizzas : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The room has a comfortable bed and large tv : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
At low tide the sea disappears but leaves a cool reef to explore : [u'location', u'sea']
The surraounding of the hotel is very clean with great plants and big swimming pool : []
But nonetheless spotless white beach : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Particularly suitable for parents with children : [u'overall', u'culture']
The staff at this hotel are brilliant always smiling, the room was beautiful and the grounds truly wonderful, we had a week before our wedding to chill and five days after : []
Same goes for the spa : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
00 per bottel : []
Although a lovely hotel, will most likely stay somewhere else that don't charge you for anything they can : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This hotel was very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There are many places to eat within walking distance for 1/4 price of hotel : [u'location', u'general']
Greatest hotel in the area : [u'location', u'general']
Book sea-view room, the triple room was much bigger than our twin room! : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I would stay here again because the price-value ratio is good : [u'location', u'sea']
This is the oldest resort in Nusa Dua so a few cracks are showing in the old girl but more than made up for by traditional finishes and features - totally charming : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
In the morning we have a pleasant surprise to see some squirrels outside our garden (we eventually bought some peanuts and fed them, very funny experience) : []
great service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Not a huge deal as we didn't really spend too much time in the room anyway : []
We had a fabulous holiday at this resort : []
First visit to Bali so wasn't sure what to expect however as we were driven into the hotel I was struck by how beautiful the setting, the grounds and the buildings were : []

The only negative was the price of transport arranged by the hotel was twice that of the local taxis : [u'location', u'sea']
We stayed for 9 days and had the same breakfast everyday : []
We travel to Bali at least 3-4 times a year for business, so once I hit Nusa Dua I just want to sit under a tree, swim and eat : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
If you are looking for a party-like holiday with clubbing/barring, hustle and bustle, stay in Kuta : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The swimming areas are large and comfortable : [u'location', u'general']
I did have a massage at the spa which also was very good : [u'amenities', u'conference']
that is all great if you are part of the party but not so great if you try and get a 4 year old to sleep : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The managers and staff should be very proud of what they have achieved at this hotel : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Excellent service & very well maintained hotel/spa : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']

We had a very relaxing time staying here for 8nights : []
All for a reasonable price considering we were in a 5 star Hotel : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

A shuttle service is offered from many restaurants and massage places : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Aside from this the facilities are very good, the kids club is tiny with quite boring and limited activities and from looking at nearby hotels their clubs seems much bigger and more fun, but the pool area was fantastic with a huge sandbank area for kids to play in and plenty of communal toys provided for kids of all ages : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Breakfast overlooking a lake, the squirrels and birds - you never want to move : [u'amenities', u'pool']
They all spoke English very well : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The rooms were cleaned daily , with fresh linen and toiletries provided : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']

The beach is well guarded to keep sellers under control in number and not to bother tourists : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']

As our check-out was several hours before our flight, we were welcome to use the spa to swim and shower prior to departured : []
Safe and clean location : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
We are just back from a three week holiday in Asia : []
The Staff at the hotel were a standout and provided great service : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
However, since the hotel still has the label as being one of the "leading hotels of the world", expectations need to be setted right: : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I explained the whole situation : [u'room-experience', u'view']
definitely would return! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thank you and see you soon :) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Maybe it was the time of year, or the combination of spicy food and heat : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We will definitely be back and will take the kids next time : []
Staff were very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Stay here and relax with great food and feeling of spreading out : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We travelled as a family and stayed for 4 nights at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []

Truly amazing hotel, fabulous staff, facilities just perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All in all we had a wonderful time and would certainly come again if in Bali : []
The room is typical balinese style : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I would recommend stepping outside of the resort and taking a short walk in to town for dinner because the food at Mai Mai is the best and I are here about 3 times : []
Great choice in different kind of bread, rolls and pastries : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The room was quiet and comfortable but it's the grounds that make this place so pleasant : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The pizzas at Sandro's were lovely and it was a lovely spot to eat looking out at the pool : []
The staff were helpful and there is a free shuttle service to a local shopping mall many times a day : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed here for 4 night on Mar 2011 : []
Have just returned from another memorable 12 day visit to this Hotel : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
It was a great place to stay with our 2 young children : []
The Hotel is very well done the staff are great and friendly and will always smile and say hello while you are walking around the grounds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We stayed here for 4 nights early April 2013 : []
I stay up to 5 days! Thats was a memorable holiday with Family : []
In terms of the location of the hotel, yes it is situated in a very sanitised complex which is very secure - you go through one checkpoint just to get into the Nusa Dua area and then another one to get into the hotel - but there is plenty of opportunity to book day trips out to other parts of the island if you want to experience the 'real' Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The ambience was amazing and our room for the honeymoon couple suite was very well looked after : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The desk staff asked if we could go and have breakfast and come back afterwards : []
We adore this hotel, the staff are truly wonderful and facilities excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Spa treatments are expensive again compared to others outside the hotel : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
We were tired the first night and wanted to get to sleep early but couldn't because the music reverberated throughout the whole hotel : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
In the morning you can attend different sports activities such as yoga, outdoors : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Wide selection of breakfast, bicycling, sunbathing, swimming, sauna and spa, truly relaxing our body and mind : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Of course you see that it is over 20 years old but the wonderful garden landscape : []
The hotel is right on the beach, The pool areas are very nice : [u'location', u'general']
Breakfast was okay, but being an Indonesian and staying in a hotel in Indonesia, I was expecting a few Indonesian dishes here but I found none : []
Further more, staying in nusa dua is synonymous with "filthy rich" so they charge you triple the price to get a ride into civilisation, and try to discourage you from using a meter taxi (so that you don't find out what it ACTULALLY would cost to get to seminyak, for example, where you will pay only $8 for a delicious meal, compared to $25 for an edible meal, at best, at the resort) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We enjoyed our 4 day stay at the hotel : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The choice is excellent, couldn't fault it : []
The breakfast buffet was fabulous : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
MUST stress though, that these are not details that would deter one from returning to this relaxing and charming hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We loved it all : []
Rooms are sufficeient decorated in wood and noice and clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
There are 4 restaurants to choose from; all excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']

Once a week there is also a special Cocktail Evening for Palace Club Guests where guests have a chance to mingle with other guests and management : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Raja's restaurant was nice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We would recommend to others : []
With much appreciation Niall Forde : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Staffs at the hotel are fantastic : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The Bali collection shopping centre is a 10 minute walk (or 2 minutes in free shuttle) with supermarket, pharmacy, department store, massage etc so you can get anything you need without any hassle : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The service staff of the hotel was very friendly and went all out to help : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
You get complimentary use of the steam room, jacuzzi, sauna and lap pool which we made full use of : []
Only problem was the noisy bed,i request the management to plant fixed beds rather dan movable other den the property worth each and every penny of guests : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
TIPS- you can purchase snacks and water at 1/3 cost at collection mini mart & go out and explore the area! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are a lot of staff, who help you any time : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Our private villa was simply stunning : [u'amenities', u'garden']
So apparently management feels as though it's acceptable for their customers to pay for these 'services' : []
we had to wait about 1/2 hr for our room to be ready so we had a quick look around and were stunned! the hotel was beautiful : []
A very good stay here, we actually went August 2012 but won't let me backdate it : []
But for the rest: lay back and enjoy : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The bunk could be pushed down the other end of the room to give the parents some privacy as I felt I had eyes on me all night : []
I like the traditional of Bali atmosphere and the jogging track which connected the beach and several hotels around : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Luckily I had a can of mosquito repellent and was able to kill the bugs : []
Nusa Dua area is built for the tourists, its clean, safe & much quieter : [u'location', u'general']
Except for the beach, which was about average, everything was just excellent : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is set on a beautiful beach with lots of sun loungers and chairs , the beach is spotless with beautiful white sand : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The staff at the property are by far the friendliest- most helpful group I have encountered at any hotel worldwide : []
We also loved the sandy lagoon pool and the location along the beach front allowed for a lovely walk after dinner : []
For the chaps or business orientated there's WIFI available, (although in selected areas), and internet available in the rooms : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We tried all of the restaurants and bars in the hotel and found them all to be of good value with very nice food : []

My husband and I stayed here when our daughter was just 6 weeks old : [u'overall', u'culture']
We also ate quite a few meals at the hotel as there aren't alot of other dining options around, apart from at the neighbouring hotels on the beach or at Bali Collection : []
Service also consistently good : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Thumbs up guys from the happy kiwis : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Crazy good Seminyak, tranquil and cultural Ubud, luxurious live-it-up Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
There are a lot of young people here; I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for some R&R : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My wife and I will certainly stay at this resort again so congratulations to management on a well presented : [u'overall', u'culture']
Easy walk along beach path to the neighbouring Westin where the conference is hosted : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Especially the SPA is amasing; : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The best hotel experience I have ever had : []
We usually stay in Legian 5* but coming into the NDBH we have been in heaven : []
We think this hotel was a good choice for our first visit to Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The breakfast was a la carte as i said with also small buffet : []
Tropical in particular was excellent value with lovely food : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
For breakfast, we would sit by the pond and watch the birds and fish while we ate nasi and mee goreng : []

I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights : []
I would recommend this place to anyone : []

A nearby lift was also a great convenience for my limted-mobility wife : [u'overall', u'culture']
We have an excellent babysitter and are enjoying ourselves here : []
So I came back this time and looking forward to return soon : [u'location', u'sea']
If we had 1 complaint it was that that the bed was hard, but on request a mattress topper was very quickly put on : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
000 IDR (ca 1 USD) : [u'location', u'sea']
There were lots of security check point about nusa dua, which are normal however as president Obama was due to stay in the hotel next to us the following week security was abnormally high but again not rude or intrusive and made me feel very safe : []
I have read a couple of bad reviews for this hotel and cannot understand how people could write such things : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
If the hotel were to be fully booked, one would have to run 'the German way' each morning to get a spot beside the pool : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
As previously quoted this is a stunning resort with beautifully laid out grounds, semi private beach and a good few restaurants on site all serving very tasty,well presented dishes at a price !The complex has excellent sports facilities if you are feeling energetic complete with a jogging track laid out : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our trip was cut short by a serious ilness in our family that required us to return to Melbourne immediatly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A beautiful location and resort with a unique setting in tranquil gardens : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The sandy beach (light brown sand) is wide and clean, with lots of deck chairs but yet not too closely placed : [u'location', u'sea']
The lap pool beside the Spa is always very quiet and relaxing if you want to get away from the crowds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A lovely hotel and our second visit : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The staff were, generally, not quite up to standard : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Everything about the stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa exceeded our expectations : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We also had some great (and cheaper) meals at Bali Collection (20 min walk along the footpath on the beach) : []
Chess (salads, sandwiches) had a good satay dish : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Our vow renewal afternoon was so special as was the Legong buffet night at Budaya that followed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The decoration and its enviroment,are good and very taken care : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The only other negatives are the bar prices, very expensive for nothing special, it was quiet with no music : []
What an amazing experience and well above our expectations : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It was a 10 minute walk to get to their room : []
Since our last stay, the pool area has been thoroughly remodelled - there are now two main pools - though we actually spent most of our time at the bliss-out beautiful and quiet spa pool : []
Our room rate included breakfast which was of the normal standard of a hotel of this type, plenty of choice : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The gardens that we looked out on with the Duck pond was fantastic and proper serene : [u'amenities', u'garden']
It was definitely a highlight of our trip : []
The staff was great - always polite and friendly, helpful and discrete : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We really enjoyed our short stay here : []
We upgraded on the deal to a Premier room as we did not want to be in a room too far away from the pool : []
There are no forceful vendors to contend with and most of the walkway is shaded by trees : [u'amenities', u'garden']
We have found that breakfast keeps us going until dinner : []
Good wheel-chair disabled facilities t/o hotel : []
The Palace Club was certainly excellent value for money, we rarely had to buy a meal whilst we stayed there : []
But not too worry : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
5* if you compare it to the spa at The Westin next door : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A lot of people were always there , always smiling, always wanting to help : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were very attentive and professional : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We came to this hotel as part of our honeymoon in July07 and we were in no way disappointed it was like staying in a little slice of paradise between the gardens, the pool area and the private beach it was out of this world : []
The architecture is Bali temple inspired without being tacky : [u'overall', u'culture']
Squirrels come down from the trees to be fed and are realy quite tame even had a couple outside on the balcony who knew every time we walked back into our room : []
When we went to check in we were greeted by a very unenthusiastic, almost rude member of staff : []
I recommend everyone try the Balinese cuisine at Raja's Restaurant, delicious : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They charge you double as the hotel gets their cut : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
best to not do this even if it sounds cheap : []
The overall holiday was a lovely experience : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Its a beautiful walk : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I broke my ankle in Ubud and the hotel went the extra mile to ensure I was comfortable and cared for : []
Staff - All staff were 5 star and the hotel should be pleased they have such a great group working for them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
which represented good value : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The rooms aren't the biggest or newest but everyone was happy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We stayed here for a week in July looking for complete relaxation : []
This was my 7th visit to Bali, and my first honeymoon there! I've visited every hotel at Nusa Dua and some are fancier, more modern, newer, and more international than this one : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Good size rooms : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You name what you don't do in other hotels, they are more tolerant than you might think : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Last note: If you want to be connected to the internet during your stay then look someplace else : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The menu were all tasty for my traditional appetite : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Slow respond and the taste was average : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
There is no kiosk or convenient store within walkable distance : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Perhaps to be over critical, the bathroom and shower needed a good scrub : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
My son and family had a great time : [u'overall', u'culture']
My only gripe on this occasion was noise from the ducks, very early in the morning : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
we arrived to a gorgeous lobby n excited bout our stay : []
I forgot to review this hotel last year when I spent four days Lebaran holiday break in Bali : []
Stayed here with our 3 children aged 5yrs, 3yrs, 4 mths and it was great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
One of our friends was having his birthday and they organized a cake and champayne : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Also, avoid hotel spas as they charge much more than the independent ones : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Possible more control or an procedure : [u'overall', u'safety']
We had a beautiful 6 course meal by the pool that evening and the food was truly amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I did report this to guest services and also on a review requested from the hotel but have not had any response : []
Nusa DUA BEACH hotel is a beautifull hotel in a quiet area of Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The tiles around the pool are too slippery : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Went in Feb 2013 with a party of 2 adults and 2 young children : [u'overall', u'culture']
our requests are granted by one service crew just to be later on denied by the other : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
Palace Club Suite was a great combination of Chef cooked meals & super friendly service overlooking the beautiful gardens : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Overall this resort is almost faultless : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Restaurants food varities & quality can be improved : []
Just a beautiful place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you are looking for somewhere different to eat you can eat at any other resorts along the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food was just beautiful and the sushi at the Japanese restaurant was our favourite : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
When we arrived were "welcomed" by a not-very-friendly receptionist : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
It cost IDR 145,200 in total and did not even eat one mouth : []
In general the hotel grounds are very beautifully laid out : [u'overall', u'safety']
Many big trees to provide shade : [u'amenities', u'garden']
A wonderful place to stay, exemplary staff, fantastic food, great massages and facials, lovely pools, and a memorable suite, plus the lounge with afternoon teas and cocktails almost to die for!!! We intend to return four times a year! : []
Average at best? : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We are falling in love with this hotel and will always be our place to stay in Nusa Dua : []
I did not face any issues during the stay : []
It was nice but the price of food was not good 60 australian for a couple of very average pizzas wasn't good beautiful place you let yourselves down with food prices also no atmosphere around pool bar probably wouldn't stay again sorry : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
Short walking distance to Bali Connection for dinners or lunch and reasonable souvenir shopping : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff were very helpful and friendly which is typical of the Balinese people : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Only down fall with this place is the food and the prices for what you get : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We are returning guests and joined my son his wife and their 16 month old son for their wedding anniversary and our own : []
It certainly needs an upgrade with an individual shower : []
Overall an excellent resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I felt I got the same quality in cheaper places : []
The appeal of the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is that over the years it has remained true to the Balinese culture which is reflected in the beautiful Balinese carvings (including the rooms), the stunning & well maintained gardens and the overall architecture : []
Nice area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We spent 8 nights here with 6 adult kids in the royal palace wing on a luxury package and couldn't fault the service or the staff : []
Highly recommend Raja's restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
and Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were able to book excursions and tours via the hotel : []
Definitely worth paying the small amount extra : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
For now, I'll either stay at Nusa Dua Beach hotel or Westin : []
To all the staff, thanks for making this resort so special : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Firstly security in and out of the property ha been increased, which makes you feel secure straight away : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Balinese staff are so lovely and friendly too : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We enjoyed sitting outside and viewing the channel of water next to the dining area, observing fish swimming past : []
The Palace Club at the Nusa Dua Beach hotel, is very unique with personalised service, a separate check-in, a lounge area for Palace Club guests where they can enjoy breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails at sunset overlooking the perfectly trimmed garden : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Staff very friendly and attentive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bali itself is fantastic I would recommend going out and seeing the island and a local restaurant called CASA BELLA is fantastic - ask the reception to call them and they pick you up and take you back to the hotel for free!! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Breakfast: plenty of food, the only disadvantage is the menu which is 90% the same day after day : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We booked the hotel through Luxury Escapes and the price represented excellent value for money as it included three themed dinners, 6 spa treatments etc : []
Please note the hotel is currently running a special on an 8 night stay, advertised on their website and not on any booking sites : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Loved Bali itself and would definitely return in the future : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Spa was amazing and rated spa of the year in 2014 and you can see why : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Well maybe for some people, you need to leave your phone home while you go to Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I don't think so : []
Fantastic hotel, excellent service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Realy peacefull and wonderfull spa + sauna : []
I am a hard person to please and this was great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Heaven on Earth!? : []
If you can leave the pools and fancy the beach the shelter from the beach trees is perfect : [u'amenities', u'garden']
1 suggestion I would say is there needed to be more free entertainment on nightly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I like the view when I entered the gate of this hotel especially in the evening, I can feel the ambiance of Bali with the little light of the lamp, it was great : []
We stayed at this resort because we have a 2year old little girl now : []
Too many souvenir selling locals resting on the hotel beach front, perhaps the security should sort of control that a little bit? This is the main reason I take out 1 star for my review : [u'overall', u'safety']
Overall, though wonderful hotel, Palce Club priviladges are good value, the rooms beautiful and spacious : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We would highly reccomend this Hotel and we will definately return next year to once again be enveloped in the warmth of the beautiful Balinese people at this hotel : []
We went in low season which was good - hardly any kids - but this would be a good option at any time : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Perfectly clean, constantly attended for stray litter (rare) and falling leaves : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Can't say enough about this place : []
The hotel overall was really lovely, we live in Dubai where the majority of the hotels are pretty much brand new and 5*, the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is neither of these but the staff, grounds, location and amenities definitely more than make up for it : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This hotel is just paradise : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The first room we were given was extremely noisy (interconnecting doors) as we could hear clearly the room next door : []
From the people that clean our room to the front line staff all so efficient with beautiful smiles : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Drinks are far too pricey : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
(example proper Calamari and chips $3 : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
After having our spa treatments that morning, we had lunch on the beach then went our separate ways to get ready : [u'location', u'sea']
Bought package through luxury escapes, royal suite upgrade, worth the little extra you pay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was amazing : []
So already expensive - but then they add 21% government tax and 10% service charge to the price! I complained several times and they agreed it was expensive and many guests had complained about it, but there was nothing they could do (was advised to have complained earlier on check out - bartering gets you everywhere here!) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Hotel's private beach was neat and clean, not very crowded : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
12:30 ish down to the In-house beach "Chess Cafe" for a quiet lunch and a cold Bintang (happy hour 16:00-19:00) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
For example, there would be chicken satay (skewered on lemon grass), butterflied grilled prawns, curries, breads, always a vegetarian option, lots of fresh cut crudities and little dips etc, just a perfect accompaniment for a few drinks before heading off to dinner later on in the evening : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I found this hotel absoloutely perfect to relax, exercise, eat well and to just enjoy Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A warm traditional holiday in Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Would highly recommend this property!! : [u'room', u'furniture']
Breakfast was average, not much variety : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Our room was great, very spacious : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The staff were very friendly and always willing to help and advise if asked : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We just got back after what can only be discribed as the most relaxing pampered holiday we have had in years : []
There are a number of pools which is good especially if there are families : [u'overall', u'culture']
Chess Restaurant meals were great quality and highly enjoyed : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Avoid something like this happened again please : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So often we had to walk to the bar to ask for it : []
Such a kind young man : [u'overall', u'culture']
and the daily recreation activities are amazing, from fruit sculpting classes to beauty therapy classes to pool volleyball - all amazing!!! I enjoyed every minute : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The exception was Raja's where we had two extremely nice meals with dishes that gave the taste buds a bit of a treat : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thank you to all the staff for making our stay very enjoyable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Keep up the good work : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 9 days in September 2007 : []
Food was supurb, prawns, fish, lobster, steaks, finished off with Banana Flambe, outstanding : [u'food-beverages', u'meal', u'amenities', u'pool']
Secondly - DO NOT uses airport porters - don't even let them pick up a bag - they will hound you for money and you really wont need their help : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Don't miss the fire dancing and smorgasbord : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Go to Batuan to see art : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'culture']
Hopefully the renovated rooms improve on a couple of the downfalls and they increase in-room entertainment options : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa has beautiful grounds, a true Balinese style hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Unfortunately the balcony is exposed to the elements : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
5 yr old son), incredible facilities and the fab location looking over the beautiful nusa dua cove : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We were met by a friendly driver at airport and our experience was faultless from begining to end : [u'overall', u'feel']
VERY relaxing, and great environment for relaxation : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I believe we got great value using the voucher but I wouldn't pay the full amount to stay (think it was $270US per night normally) : []
My wife and I had the most fantastic stay there : [u'overall', u'culture']
So, we were really hoping for the luxury and quiet space we should have had all week - and we were rewarded very well! On arrival, the staff were very welcoming and completely prepared for our arrival : []
Luckily there were 3 restaurants and they're all open until 11pm so we could eat late : []
There are a few restaurants here, but not much variety at the Chess restaurant next to the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Nice shops at the resort, but no good local shopping nearby : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
The wifi is surprisingly fast and fantastic - it was free and covered the entire grounds : []
Western style resort charges Western prices : [u'location', u'general']
We stayed at this hotel in April 2010 for 6 nights with two children aged 5 and 8 : []
Buffet breakfast was very good and we were lucky enough to be there for Chinese New Year when there was a buffet and stage show in the gardens : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
From the moment we checked in until our unfortunate departure, we could not have been more impressed nor had a more enjoyable stay at this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
stayed for 4 nights : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
It was lovely to attend a number of cultural/theatre evenings within the resort : []
Very good staff, lovely surroundings, we spent most of the time between the pools and the beach : []
The breakfast was one of the best I have encountered, everything was fresh, hot and the items prepared for you as you waited were an absolute treat : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
When ordering transport at the front desk ,in general ASK for a bluebird cab as it will be cheaper than the HOTEL transport : []
The drinks menu at the pool bar was limited, however, the pool bar man "Machardi" would make anything you ask for : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is pristine with lots of chairs : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The staff were lovely and welcoming as you would expect in a good Bali hotel and the restaurants were varied and all had great food : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There are lots of them! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Room, hotel facilities are all great : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
there are lot of activities which you can do here like water sports, spa, cycle rides that time flies like anything : [u'location', u'sea']
Despite being the most expensive part of our holiday nusa dua was also the most relaxing and this was a lot to do with the environment of the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I'd stay in Ubud or Seminyak if I was on vacation! But for the conference, it was fine : []
The only thing this hotel has going for them is their beach, great location and not crowded at all, unlike the pool that everyone reserves their chair before breakfast : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Breakfast buffet was superb - ticked all of the boxes, everyday!! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We have just returned from a 15 night stay at The Nusa Dua Beach Resort & Spa and if you're looking for somewhere to 'recharge the batteries' - look no further! All the staff were friendly & helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Theme nights entertainment is great but some of the food not very tasty, lacking that little extra (all buffets), a little overpriced if you had to pay the $28 per head, Disappointed when Fire Dance held on Friday nights, held in restaurant for fear of rain, hardly anyone could see past the poles and BBQ area, when we complained the waiter told us to sit down and watch, even though there were numerous empty tables at the front of the restaurant, my husband approached a supervisor who did move us and told us the drinks would be complimentary (1 wine 1 beer) BUT we still were charged for the meal and drinks at the end of our stay, even though the meal was covered in our package : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Everything is made freshly for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua is a nice resort for a relaxing holiday but if you want a nice room this is not the best hotel to go to : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Kids Club ladies there were so attentive and smiling all the time and trying to make her feel comfortable, not to mention other kids to play together : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Not just by the pool but at the restaurants as well it happened : []
The pizza from Sandrino was better of a night than during the day and the light meals from chess very good value at any time : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We recently spent 10 days at the resort and wanted for nothing : []
On our first night we wanted to get transport to a local restaurant for dinner : []
We did not eat many meals as we seem to have had enough to eat after the cocktails and canapes : []
I came back & then wait another 30 minutes till the staff ( Adi) get all the backups from back office : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The main pool was sometimes loud with children and splashing but the spa pool was always quiet and relaxing for an afternoon read : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The best thing regarding this hotel was their excellent service ,everything you asked was in your hand in few minutes : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is plenty of drawers and hanging space unlike a lot of other places : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Swimming pools are great with easy access to beach, breakfast restaurant is fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Also, the service was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Firstly the buildings and traditional temples within the grounds are spectacular : [u'overall', u'safety']
Your room was cleaned everyday : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The only think this hotel need to look out is their staff attentiveness,they're nice but sometime they aren't quite helpful in term of helping hands so might need to address them for help : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Don't hesitate to take a garden-facing room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
You may notice, even the guests can perch up at the lobby to access a fast free wifi in hotel area : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Most of the staff were fantastic, but the people at the Concierge desk seemed inattentive, and did not appear interested in helping us : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
At first I was surprised how many questions they asked but then found it is polite in Balinese culture to ask a lot of questions : []
We felt safe and secure and already planning our next visit, but next time we will stay longer : []
Beach is better than others in Bali, grounds are immaculate and nothing too difficult for the staff : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The staff are very courteous too : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The treatment rooms are luxurious, private changing areas & beautiful bathrooms to rinse & shower in if necessary, there are couples rooms to enjoy your treatments together also : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
It's the additional things that they do at this hotel which has made the experience an unforgettable one!!! : [u'overall', u'feel']
I have been to this hotel several times and have another trip booked in 6 weeks time : []
The room was plenty large enough for us and the 2 kids aged 3 and 1 : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
com has so helpfull made great trip suggestions very honest and reliable, change money at resort or bail collection money changes in shops outside resort gates are very shifty and will take you down if they can all in all great place [ quite not like kuta or otherside of island], pools, food,people, service,location all very good would stay again for sure : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
-Room and hotel grounds were clean and quiet : [u'overall', u'safety']
But this place would make an amazing getaway for a week and if I can bring my family to Bali, this is definitely where we will stay : []
As a business traveller I spend two thirds of the year travelling around the world and in hotels and this one was absolutely incredible : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The breakfast was great : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I also used the on site hair salon : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The overall feeling of our room was that it wasn't too clean : []
The chess restaurant male staff i the young chap when asked about a particular dish on the taste replied he doesnt know he has never tasted it : []
the more authentic side of Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The bathroom was so modern, and yet the shower was extraordinary 'rain' type : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
This was very unexpected and lovely : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast buffet was fairly extensive but had the same exact selections day after day which became pretty boring after the sixth day : [u'amenities', u'conference']
From a price-quality perspective, it is hard to beat this hotel : []
The staff are lovely but that's just Bali people, they're all lovely : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Bathroom is nicely laid out and appointed, but water pressure was so low that whowering was painful : []
This was our 3rd trip to Bali and 1st stay at this hotel so we had a measure of what to expect/ From the moment you enter the grounds of the hotel with its breath taking Balinese architecture you get a feeling of calm and relaxation : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
Would I use Luxury Escapes - YES but I would also look at the hotel website as they had a similar offer and I always prefer to book direct with hotel, just my preference : []
A lot of frustrated guests around the pool area : [u'location', u'general']
The rooms, breakfast, pool area, beach and service is okay but nothing over the top : [u'location', u'general']
indonesian, western, japanese, italian pasta : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
The location is great and not to far to travel anywhere : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The accommodation we booked was beautiful with rooms well maintained and clean, even the small details such as a clothes line above the bath was included - which was very handy for wet swimmers! The grounds were beautifully kept and huge : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Thank you to all the staff for their amazing service and beautiful nature : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The added benefit of having complimentary high tea and cocktails and au d'oeuvres was fab : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Fantastic place to stay - "private" and "gorgeous" are some key words that come to mind about this place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So providing everything runs smoothly this place is amazing : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
To praise the environment, the Balinese architecture of the hotel lobby, restaurants, rooms and overall garden & pool & beach landscape would mean bringing coals to Newcastle : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
This was the 3rd leg of our Asian 5 star tour, and although really nice building, grounds and beach it just lacked a little on a couple of things like service and the room felt very damp (our helpful cleaner Warna said that he could bring a dehumidifier if we wanted, so may have had similar issues?) we decided to turn off the air con at night and seemed to be better : []
They offer many great quality food to make up your energy, and the omelette was magical, the cheese was so sticky and melting like pizza when you pull it off, kudos! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nice view : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel has 4 restaurants which we enjoyed other than the pizza one which was not good : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The blow dryer was screwed down in a drawer so you do not steal it and you had to keep your finger on the button for it to stay on : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The best solution is to engineer out the problem : [u'amenities', u'conference']
and it was very nice : []
Being late in the evening the last thing I wanted to do was to get dressed and go to the front desk : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Do not travel without a cab !!! Especially in cul de sac areas : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
I strongly suggest you book a club room with club benefits as they personal service and free drinks between 5-7pm are a very big bonus coupled with the snacks and fruit and coffee through the day : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We would definitely recommend the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa and can't wait to return! : []
If you really wanted to find a reason to complain about something you could find a few little problems but this resort is overall great value for money and the staff are very friendly, efficient and want to make your stay as good as they can for everyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is gorgeous in its architecture, the staff are very friendly and helpful, the food is amazing (From Wedang Jahe to the Asian Bistro) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We also encountered another issue which was totally outside of our experience of staying in hotels : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Suggest focusing more on the cleanliness of the toilets : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I could go on for a lot longer singing the praises of this Hotel, but I think Ill save that for the next time I visit here : []
We highly recommend this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Only draw back was the lack of communication between wait staff and kitchen resulting in food taking way longer to arrive or not arrive at all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
As we were contemplating the options available for returning back , the kind hotel staff offered us a ride to the Hotel with their own Transport without any monetary benefit !!! If it were not for them, I'm sure we would be totally drenched walking from Bali Collection to the Resort : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The surroundings of the hotel were beautifully decorated and we couldn't wait to see our rooms : []
Breakfast in Palace Club was excellent, all staff very attentive - special thank you to Ayu for her wonderful helpfulness : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
The water is warm & very clear : [u'amenities', u'pool']
And when we wanted to use the internet on the business centre they were going to charge us A$3 : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The feeling of being someone special, started when we were picked up the airport : []
The resort is well located and is in a great position in the bay : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Hope to go back one day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Possibly the only one, however be careful as around the pool as its particularly slippery : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It was such a relief after the hectic drive from the airport in Denpasar : []
A great introduction to the other side of Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Good place to escape hassling from locals on kuta to seminyak strip : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
There are lots of other restaurants and shops in this area but they are not within walking distance of the hotel : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Shutter doors and glass sliders to veranda which had 2 wooden chairs and a table : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Breakfast was AMAZING, everything you could want from a buffet breakfast (also included vegemite!!) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms were spacious and comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The next morning we were feeling better and were able to start fully enjoying the hotel : []
A great deal of care and attention goes into the room service : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It was nice to see the hotel spending some money on modernisation (new restaurant, the Tamarind, opening in July and improved poolside accommodation) : []
I recently visited Bali for a conference and stayed at this hotel just 5 minutes walk to the conference venue : []
Loved the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There's a path that you can walk along the beach from hotel to hotel which is great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It is isolated from other areas but for a reasonable price there are many guides available, we organised one from trip advisor recommendations and did a day : []
The staff are friendly and accommodating, and the restaurants and bars (particularly the swim up bar) is excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The hotel and its gardens were beautiful and the staffs were amazing : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I travel a lot and this hotel and spa were exceptional in all areas : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Going for a swim in the see was just not good, you were swimming next to you will see plastic bags, plastic bottles, etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We come to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel Palace Club nearly every year : []
The whole entire stuff at the Nusa Dua Hotel are the most spiracle and kindest people and we can say we had the privilege of meeting a lot of them : []
Our rooms were very good & clean, accessible to most of the restaurants : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
but at my last visit (dec '14), I felt that the hotel was not what it once was : []
Overall an awesome stay at the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Both of our rooms came with a balcony that overlooked the pool and garden area which was great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
For the young more adventurous people like us, I suggest to enjoy the pool and room and get out as soon as you're thinking about doing or eating something :-) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Of all the hotels on this strip of beach line : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We stayed 10 days and in that time we were not able to score any of the recliners : []
We love the chess bar and diner by the sea : []
We reserved a regular room (not a suite) but the hotel still decorated our room with their honeymoon package : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff were all attentive, helpful & extremely friendly - that goes for the security guards at the front gate as well !!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room was advertised as sleeping 4 but only had the king and a single bed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
After 10 minutes of negotiations they offered RP1,000,000 for return across two vehicles : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
I am delegation of KTT Bali Democracy Forum VI : []
I really enjoyed the daily breakfast here too : []
The middle of the day was the only time you had a chance of being able to use it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our package included the 3 theme night dinners : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The wooden shutters in the bathroom were broken and the water in the basin took ages to drain, the bed smelt of damp and the service during breakfast and the buffet dinner was bad : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
Hope everyone else enjoys this resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Indeed all the staff were friendly and pleasant : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The gardens and surrounds at this hotel were extremely well kept and beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I had attended a conference in Nusa dua in July 2012 and post the conference I had asked my family to join me for a couple of days : []
Beautiful location, great service, amazing views : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Built around 1983 it's becomming a little jayed but if you want a resort style getaway it is all that you need : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort is a good choice if you are after a luxury escape : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
from the time we check in the hotel at the lobby itself we already fall in love with the beauty and their balinese traditional wood carving, it was so beautiful the receptionist staff and other dept are so friendly the beach was so beautiful and clean they had balinese cultural show during dinner we are very impressed during our stay there their traditional bali food was marvelous it was a very enjoyable stay there and will definately recoment to my friends : []
I have seen mixed reviews, but we had a well priced meal and there are not many places were you can pick your own fish and have it served on the beach watching the sunset : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Check-in took me 15min, longer than I expect : []
The balinese split gate (Candi Bentar) structure and the serene garden opposite hotel lobby is my favourite spot of the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
By M and M Beachy-Head : [u'amenities', u'pool']
This was the second time I stayed at Nusa Dua Hotel and Spa : []
Beach is clean and well maintained : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
You do not have much choices when come to lunch and dinner time at the hotel, i was feeling grateful that the hotel was giving 4 x rp50,000 voucher, but you can only spent each rp50,000 voucher for every rp200,000 you have spent : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A great Bali experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I felt I was the most important person on earth! : []
You cant miss it as this area is not big : [u'location', u'general']
Truly lovely resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
5 hours driving distance away, no free internet (1 hour internet card is $5) : [u'overall', u'culture']
Overall this resort is excellent value for money, and now with the the new toll way it is easy to get a taxi to Seminyak for some excitement if you get bored : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Waking up sweating every night is not fine for me : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Take a 2 min walk to the road outside the resort and get a better rate on cabs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We did make use of the onsite spa with several treatments and these were of a good standard for Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Best decision I ever made : []
I miss it so much and we would return in a heartbeat : []
Nusa Dua Beach is a hotel that fit for all : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
What a fantastic location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were there for 10 days and really loved it : []
One of the coolest one in Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Wednesday was a cocktail evening with management : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had a great time at NDBH : []
The resort has spectacular gardens and fountains : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The GM Mr Klee definitely knows how to look after each and every guest the Director of sales Rubi : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The extra staff and training this year is noticed and the new restaurant on the beach will be a winner : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
So it beggers belief that 30 minutes of internet access will cost you 30,000 Rup! In a 5 star hotel you CAN NOT be charging for Wi-Fi : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Bali Collection has more authentic food and much better prices : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We were 2 couples staying at the hotel in May 2014 for ten nights : []
If it was not for the Excellent service provided by the Spa team I would have changed hotels : []
It's a bit away from the rooms but quiet, relaxing and a nice change from the main pools : []
We stayed in a Palace Club Room : []
Staff are very friendly and attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had a table right on the grass so the kids could run around while we finished up or listened to the band : []
The spa was a delight and we had facials and massages which I would recommend : []
Just outside the "Security gates" of Nusa Dua is a small village where there are market shops and restaurants - go to one called the Tavern, great food and great staff and bar - free pick up and drop off from hotel : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The place exudes Bali design and culture and staff are super attentive and friendly : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
This hotel is a first class experience, we loved the room, the view and the service was emaculate : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
For shopping only option is to the Nusa Dua center via shuttle, which is available every 1 hr : [u'amenities', u'conference']
One thing we booked at the same time and I thought our rooms would be close but we could not have been further apart : []
Kind regards to all staff at the hotel x : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A man in his 40s - not overweight, with glasses, always informative with his service and pleasant with it, and a younger man around 30 who was also informative and very professional : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Our stay at this hotel was perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
M has only one pool for kids and no sandy pool is available : [u'overall', u'culture']
Breakfast buffet was amazing and had many choices including both american and ethnic : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There are wood carvings everywhere, and a beautiful water fountain in the lobby : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Definitely a better part of the resort for those without children : [u'overall', u'culture']
A large TV and Unit, which incorporated our fridge fully stocked with water, soft drinks, alcoholic drinks and snacks : [u'amenities', u'conference']
the pool area is quite big and there were a good number of shadey spots available : [u'location', u'sea']
The only real issue we had was that the pool is too hot : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
One of the best bits for us was the spa : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Whilst there are many great things about this hotel there are also aspects that aren't so good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Prices for clothing were on par with the large centre in Kuta and a lot less hassle : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Keep the Real Bali Style : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
One is the massage ladies who are to the left of the beach : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Great place to stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I have recently stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for 4 nights with my husband and 2 children (13 and 11), and can thoroughly recommend this hotel : []
gr8 ladies changing room with jacuzzi, sauna and good toiletries : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
I make special mention of the pool bar attendant, Mr : []
We came in late at night at Nusa Dua and we noticed the welcome and anniversary greetings in our room, it's good : []
The club serves drinks each evening in an area facing the gardens : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The pizza restarant at the pool was really great, the pizza delicious and the service perfect : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The rooms were cleaned and mini bar was stocked everyday : [u'amenities', u'patio']
almost everything that can make a great stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall though the resort was excellent I'd give it 8/10 and I would definiatley go back, I cant say the same about the rest of Bali though, Kuta for one is simply filthy and you get swarmed upon by people trying to sell you something or simply to rip you off : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is very beautiful and have excellent facilities but the bedroom is just reasonable and doesn't match the expectations due to the price, superior than the average in Bali : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Because I had never been to anywhere tropical like this I had to get used of the temperature and sometimes very hot we always went to the pool : []
Drinks are also heavily overpriced at this resort : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
As a photography fan he never minded taking pics for us : []
Room number 3129 is two adjoining rooms on the third floor over looking the pool and the ocean, beautiful view, huge rooms, spotlessly clean, bright and airy, straight down to the pool, and as you are on the corner near the royal residents there is no common wall on that side and the balcony wraps around towards the ocean : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
best spa in nusa dua i can say !! i got a private villa with open air shower when i opted for their balinese massage : []
In fact the setting is awesome with the shallow beach a few metres away, 150,000 Rupia per hour massages there and great snorkeling so inexpensive : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Staff were exceptional, friendly and helpful with nothing being too much trouble : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The food was exceptional : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Thank you to the Team at NDBRS we had a fantastic New Year's Eve party and wonderful stay overall : []
Certainly not somewhere I would recommend : []
Third - I received follow up phone calls from staff until my husband arrived to check that we were all ok : []
Restaurants were all great, loved the whole duck at Rajas : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We had a deluxe room for 4 and it looked ok when we went in, a bit dark but nice furniture and perfect for our needs : []
Special thanks to Bapak Sukadana from swimming pool, and Bapak Swastra ( I am sorry if mispelled ) from Wedang Jahe restaurant :) for their kindness and services We will be glad return here one day : []
as this place is just one of its kind : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
9 so that was annoying however, when staying in a resort one can expect prices to be higher : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Breakfast options are wide and varied : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I had a particularly stress-free time - I use a manual wheelchair and cannot walk : []
However, we did as always enjoy our stay and the weather was perfect during the 2 weeks : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was our 4th stay and no doubt we'll be back : []
I stayed in a palace club suite with my wife and my son and wife with two young children in the family wing : []
Clean, spacious and comfortable rooms, fantastic pools which my son did not want to leave : [u'overall', u'culture']
Not enough choices for breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
As Nusa Dua area getting dead faster than Kuta-Legian-Seminyak are after dark, the concept of Lobby Bar of the hotel which opens until 2 : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The baramundi and the burgers were excellent : []
We would definitely recommend this hotel and would go back tomorrow! : []
We loved being part of the Palace Club, the breakfast at the club were great, cooked to order and peaceful location : []
My biggest complaint was that we were located on the opposite side of the resort from our daughter and her family : []
daily lavinsh breakfats spread and 3 hours long spa and facial was an icing on the cake : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Neglect the reviews stating poor conditions of the hotel - like the hotel is outdated, old, etc : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Wonderful service, food was amazing and spa very relaxing! Wonderful place relax for our honeymoon! They upgraded us and we enjoyed everything about our stay! And wifi was quick and free! Spa lagoon pool was beautiful and really relaxing and the koi fish in the lobby were awesome! Big grounds to wonder around! : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Staff are friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We stayed at this hotel because the Westin (next door) was fully booked, and I'm really glad it was, because we had a great time : []
The hotel's rates is very affordable for its standards, and offers decent amenities comparable to the best hotels which Bali has to offer : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The food offered at the restaurants is varied and great quality : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Nice rooms : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms are spacious and luxurious, no comment on that! : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
the whole nusa dua area was so impressive because it gave us the feeling of security and exclusivity : []
(family with young kids) : [u'overall', u'culture']
Most resorts in Nusa Dua are based on Western architecture, not the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, which is based on traditional Balinese architecture : [u'amenities', u'conference']
However, the only downfall I can point out is with the use of WIFI and having to pay for it : [u'amenities', u'conference']
000 to take you to the mall nearby : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
I've stayed in this hotel for so many times, probably this is my 11th times : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Balinese styled hotel is an outstanding holiday destination one of its main attributes is the dedication and warmth of their staff many of whom have been with the hotel for many years plus world class facilities and service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It is very quiet so if you like to party hard its probably not for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is so spectacular that I thought there had been a mistake : []
Went to Kuta/ Legian/ Seminyak in a cab approx 80,000-100,000 rph one way [negotiate with hotel cars or get a cab outside the hotel] for a couple of nights where the choice is a bit more varied and there is more life and it's a pleasant way to spend the evening : []
Thankfully they offer a small buffet at night instead of table service which works much better, especially because it so much busier now the staff can concentrate on their guests : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The Spa and treatments are out of this world and i highly recommend a traditional Balinese massage : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
I have stayed at other hotels in Nusa Dua and this is the only one that I want to return to : []
The staff are all so friendly and helpful, they delighted in providing the boys with food to feed the fish every morning : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Nusa Dua treats Honeymoon Couples with a comfort and care which speaks for finest hospitality to Guests : [u'amenities', u'conference']
If you don't have a room facing the interior pool area the view is uninspiring and the generator from the adjacent resort make sitting on the balcony unpleasant due to the loud hum coming from the generator : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In general the staff had a very fake politeness : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Service was great especially in the restaurants and reception : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Negatives were price, standard rooms are a bit ordinary : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This time the suite was even better arranged than before : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
From check-in so efficiently taken care of by Ms : []
Our daughter celebrated her birthday while we were at the resort : []
Me and my husband spent the last part of our honeymoon here : []
The decor and general feel of the room is nice and ambient rather than standard decor from a chain hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One small niggle was the daily scramble for pool or beach loungers - often arriving after a leisurely breakfast to find virtually all of them reserved with towels but not being used - not what is expected of a 5 start property - management needs to sort it out : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There was a noticeable damp smell as well : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
We quickly found several other very good eateries along the beach so this was not a huge problem for us : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Although the pools are quite small and as only 50% capacity, quite busy, we quickly discovered the quiet pool in the spa area and spent a lot of time relaxing there : []
i have never reviewed before but felt I had to say how wonderful this place is : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I would go back : []
We had 2 couples traditional Balinese massages with my partner (who took some convincing being a 'tradie bloke' but is now totally converted) : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Most requests were swiftly attended to, even at late hours : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
Very good resturants to eat in evenings : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We just returned from a great family holiday in Bali : []
When we asked whether the offer was available I was told a flat no without any explanation : []
The NBH is an excellent hotel in balinese style : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Just sit next to the pool and beach (don't expect spectacular sunsets on this side of the island though!) and read : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Staff were attentive and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Beautiful beach and great pool so best of both worlds : [u'overall', u'culture']
I booked Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for my 75 year old mum as our dad recently died so she wanted a relaxing week away from everything : [u'overall', u'culture']
We had been to Bali and stayed at Sanur previously and if you like a nice beach, Nusa Dua is definitely the place : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The hotel is nice and clean with many helpful and friendly staff and there is plenty of security about : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The annoying part is their guide kept trying to hustle us : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They still talk about dodge ball and the games they did : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks are a really nice touch with the type of room we have : []
was amazed when I got to view the baby turtles entering the sea for the first time : [u'overall', u'culture']
It's basically a monster tourist factory, and the only connection to Balinese culture is that's it's physically located in Bali : []
This is a great place to relax : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Functional with a charm and very clean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
definitely stay in the palace club, breakfast there is great with a nice relaxing view of the gardens : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The package for 8 days was good value : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
However, this hotel is just old and a little bit worn out : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
At night there are lizards all over the place (not in rooms unless you leave a window open!) but that's to be expected : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'elevator']
GM take note, this lady should be rewarded for her extraordinary enthusiasm and warmness!! : [u'overall', u'culture']
But I don't like the tiles in the bathroom and there's no bathtub : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
The Nusa Dua Beach & Spa Hotel would have to be 1 of the best resorts we have stayed at, if you like the relaxed atmosphere of old style hotels as we do : []
Lots of chill zones : [u'location', u'general']
The bar was open until 2am and when we arrived at 1am we could unwind with a drink and were not made to feel like they wanted to close for the night : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There are several hotel restaurants- all seem to have a variety of food : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Friendly staff, food Ok, A/C inadequate, humidity relentless, No extra key for room, no stores near, very family oriented, pool cloudy,rooms and common areas need much maintainence : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The breakfast was great with just about everything that you could think of : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Restaurants were nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
After visiting Kuta we could not wait to come back to the peace and nice surroundings of Nusa Dua : []
Just make sure you're firm in saying no and you'll be fine : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great location so you can travel effortlessly to the different hotspots and back : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The place is fairly large and run in a very industrial fashion : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I have been coming to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel now for 4 years and it is most enjoyable : []
Much of the design and construction took the existing trees and plant life into consideration so the pool areas have some natural shade : [u'location', u'general']
In night, resort lightings made our mood romantic : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Very relaxing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bathroom is a little on the small side, but adequate nonetheless : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The pool is fantastic and the spa is great, with its own quiet pool and complimentary use of the sauna, hot tub and steam room facilities : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Waiting period during breakfast was quite long : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There was so much to do : []
We enjoyed our stay here : []
Would definitely recommend this resort to family and friends and will be back soon! : [u'overall', u'culture']
Our Deluxe room was excellent all you could want for : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed in the Palace Club room for 3 nights : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We choose this hotel because we are curious : []
Breakfast is magnificent, you can roll whatever you want there at Wedang Jahe Restaurant : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The housekeeping and staff in general were very friendly wherever you walked : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Whereas the Nusa Dua was ok, the Laguna was awesome : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The staff in the Palace Club were outstanding, taking the time to chat with guests and showed a genuine interest in their stay : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Overall, I would recommend this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Cannot wait to stay at this gorgeous resort again! Perfect for the whole family : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We have been to Bali many times but was the first time we stayed in Nusa Dua : []
Had a garden view room and in the evening the beauty of the gardens, with the fountains in the lake, was very, very tranquil : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Great for families and couples : [u'overall', u'culture']
The spa area is worth a go : [u'location', u'general']
The hotel is a 3+ to 4 star and and whilst had a great holiday if was to return to nusa dua area would stay at one of the others : [u'location', u'sea']
I was expecting bigger room and found few mosquito : []
The only downside was that there was no iron and ironing board provided in the room, the bathroom is very old and needs a upgrade as mold around the tiles, half shower door caused flooding after a shower : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
It is so peaceful : []
The spa was great value for money & was a beautiful experience : []
Beach is lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
00 am everyday for those who wants to sit and to drink while enjoying the night atmosphere of the hotel with background of its stunning gardens and for those who still wanna "hanging" out-of-room morever after 10 : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The pedicure was three times what I would normally pay, but I must say, the quality was really good : [u'overall', u'safety']
com however our stay has been disappointing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If I had one real complaint is that the air-conditioning does not go below 23deg C : [u'amenities', u'elevator']
The hotel has a lovely beachside restaurant as well as a great breakfast setting and a very nice spa and sports centre (with tennis - a playing partner included, squash, great gym, billiards and table tennis) and offers free photos for couples, sunrise yoga and a great running track (which goes up and down nusa dua past all the hotels) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Easy to get transport from the hotel or find a driver for your stay outside hotel around bali collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I would certainly have no hesitation in recommending the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa to anyone looking to stay in a 4 star property in Nusa Dua : []
I enjoyed my yoga and jogs along the main pathway, my children loved playing tennis, soccer on the beach, bike riding and ping pong was the highlight of this holiday : [u'overall', u'culture']
5 min walk slow place to conference centre : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Overall good but not an eye for finer things (eg pool/ac bacteria) and checkin (VIP Staff) brief explanation and soon forgotten even when i asked them for something i needed : []
Breakfast and food quality in the restaurants need improvement : [u'overall', u'safety']
This experience has really shaken us up quite badly since we had never experience this before after having been to Bali for 3 previous trips (in fact, never in all our travels!) : []
It is disappointing to read some negative comments on trip advisor about Nusa Dua Hotel : []
The resort was everything we expected and much more! Great value all round : []
This is a quality hotel providing excellent service and a real Balinese atmosphere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But unfortunately its reception/guest officer in the morning session is not really responsive dealing with guess : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were offered an 'upgrade' to another room also without a pool view which we declined : []
The hotel has a gorgeous location with pools and bars/restaurants overlooking a wonderful beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Deluxe rooms have been refurbished, so whilst it is smaller than the Premier rooms, it is newer : []
The room size was average even though because of high occupancy, we were upgraded to a premier room, it was small and noisy from the construction site close by : []
The pools are lovely but we did have problems getting lounges : []
Your dinners were fantastic, mainly seafood bbQ but I believe there should have been aliitle bit more meats etc : []
Fantastic facilities,awesome lap pool and gym : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Take the time to get to know the staff and say hello & thanks etc in their language - it's worth it for the smiles alone! We had to stay an extra night due to Jetstar cancelling the flights due to volcanic ash - so tried another room which was just as great : []
The service and the food was the best we have ever had anywhere : []
The many resuaturants inside the resort also catered for Coeliacs which is surprising, just triple check with the head chef as their understanding of gluten is limited : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Last year we stayed in private villas in Bali and it was amazing, that's my tip! Fantastic for families : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The spa was good; the theme nights were very good : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The Club package opened up the ability for afternoon tea refreshments which allowed us to have a few snacks with the kids before bed : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We had a small glitch with our room when we got here, but this was quickly sorted out, no problem what so ever : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Feel so good : []
We would have appreciated more complimentary bottled water each day, as it is necessary to consume a great deal to rehydrate : []
I had booked into a Palace Club room and the spacious room was a perfect blend of Balinese charm and 21st Century : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The balcony was quite dirty when we first arrived : []
Buffet breakfast, buffet afternoon tea, pre dinner cocktails FREE! Delicious!! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
Escape from the hustle and bustle of a busy World : [u'overall', u'culture']
30am to 10 : []
2) Twice a week the hotel has folk music until 9 pm : []
Our entire stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa was a wonderful experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Buffet breakfast had almost the same thing everyday : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Hotel was spacious and green, we brought my 4 months baby along and is baby friendly : []
I was very happy with my decision to stay here : []
I was staying in a deluxe room, which is not too big : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Grounds are lavish and overflowing with Palm trees and tropical plants : [u'overall', u'safety']
My husband had a stab at the fully equipped gyms : [u'overall', u'culture']
Food was far less than expected : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
If you are looking for a tasteful, upmarket, value for money hotel you cant go wrong with this one! We will definitely be back! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Afternoon tea was also great and the scones and sweets were very good and presented very nicely : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were friendly and attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Highly recommend the Palace Club lounge,beautiful surroundings and even more beautiful staff : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
super recommendation : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
After a lot of careful research I picked this hotel as the location for our wedding because it was one of the few places I could find where we could get married and see the sea, which was my dream : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The sand is very grainy, almost pebbles : [u'location', u'sea']
A very quiet and clean hotel with great people around : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We booked a superior room for three and much to our delight , were given a sea-facing room which offered a panoramic view of the vast expanse of the sea from our huge L-shaped balcony : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This is a stunning suite with separate cloakroom, living room, bedroom and bathroom with a balcony complete with two sun loungers : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I booked a premium room with a great pool view but these rooms don't seem to be as well kept as the higher priced rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I came with my husband and son to celebrate my husbands 32nd birthday and the trip has been wonderful and all due to the super friendly hotel staff, the excellent fine wine and dining (let's not forget that they catered for my 7 : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The Hotel has a great location in Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We have stayed in Nusa Dua 3 times and this was our first stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa and it was the most fantastic hotel in all of my stays : []
Has business faciitlies but we didn't use them : []
People are friendly and serves with a warm heart especially the housekeeping team : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Room was wonderful, welcome flowers and champagne but overlooking the construction site next door that operated for 16 hours a day and spot lights 24hrs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In the garden around the hotel you can spend a lot of time and amaze about the diverse plants, trees, flowers and animals : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were a family of 4 with 2 teenagers 14 & 17 : []
The nusa doa is the best place, but if you look for some night intersegments & more restaurant you should visit kuta, we rent motor bike & visit the kuta every night : []
The breakfast was good and the swimming pool was also good : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The pool aria is gorgeous by day and by night and all our stay was very pleasant : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
This was a hotel with great Balinese character, with authentic temples and lovely landscaped grounds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Although we were allocated a room on the 1st floor and quite far away from reception, it was actually quite near the beach and pool bar and restaurant : []
The resort is beautiful and staff is extremely friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We have stayed at this hotel two times before, what a great change has been performed by the present manager : [u'overall', u'culture']
Great setting and well cooked fresh food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The treatment was divine! One night , we ordered room service and that was equally delicious! Thre pesto fettucine were refined and tasty! Overall, it was an idyllic short holiday at a fantastic and truly world class resort! I couldn't flaw this hotel at all : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
This was disappointing and needs to be improved : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The best resort to relax, sunbath, swimming, multi-cuisine food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The hotel and the grounds are the best and we are planning to go back next year for our first anniversary : []
A truly majestic resort, with rooms newly renovated surrounded by a plethora of plush gardens and stunning grounds : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The hotel amenities were great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We have stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach hotel on several occasions and it's an remarkable hotel in a superb setting : []
Varieties of foods are served in the restaurant range from local, Japanese, Chinese, Westerns : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
All in all we loved this resort and would highly recommend it : []
After many stays in villas around the island, we tried a luxury escape at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
I asked to check in the store room and found our 2 bags sitting in the middle of the floor : []
Our family (two adults, two kids) loved the hotel and atmosphere : [u'overall', u'culture']
The bathrooms too were clean and dry : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The water bottles are not included in the hotel price, which with regard that you cannot drink tap water is very cheap : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The worst - getting good Balinese / Indonesian food for dinners, and of course, byo wine : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My son who is 15 asked if the hotel was an old palace, it does have feeling of old Bali grandeur about it, I liked it as although it is an old hotel it still feels very much like a Bali hotel, some of the newer hotels feel as if you could be anywhere in the world : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A great place to end a holiday after Kuta : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
I would expect for an hotel like this to provide better wi-fi service everywhere : []
that's ridiculous : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were really friendly : [u'amenities', u'patio']
If you like the beach, green gardens and a selection of restaurants and pools then this hotel would be a great option : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Some of the restaurants in the area offer a free pick up & drop off service : []
My husband and I stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 5 nights : [u'overall', u'culture']
There is, however, A very nice pool within view of the water : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']

Some mornings trying to get a cup of coffee/ tea could be difficult : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
My wife did 8am yoga three times and it was very, very good : []
Out of the luxury resorts directly on the beach, this is the nicest for an authentic feel - it's Balinese in look and feel : []
We had a lovely time lazing around the beach, soaking up the beautiful ambience, and relishing the yummy fare : []
The rooms are lacking for one thing or another and finding someone who speaks acceptable english is a challenge : [u'overall', u'culture']
Great customer service, close enough to go to Seminyak using toll road 17mins approx, however you may consider this an inconvenience it's only a small fair to pay while staying in this beautiful resort ($10-$14) : []
The food in restaurant and room service are delicious, but the price very expensive (especially in restaurant) and be ready to wait, its need 25 mnts for room service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Large pool top bars ,good swimming beach and the management are all down to earth staff treat u like family palace club is the best set up club I've seen : []

Wish we had taken down his name : []
Located in Nusa Dua which is my favourite location in Bali : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I can't recommend this resort highly enough : [u'amenities', u'pool']
I was very grateful to them when they helped out with questions about transport and local amenities : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
30 pm a little to early for our liking! The lobby and grounds of the hotel are beautiful and the beach is cleaned daily : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our stay was excellent and it was in the perfect position on the beach of Nusa Dua : []
The first stop was Nusa Dua : [u'amenities', u'patio']
breakfast was great a lot of choices to pick from : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Maybe if we had been seasoned Resorties we may have had some issues with the sometimes tired looking wood in the rooms and beach loungers but for us it was a wonderful treat after 2 years of backpacking : []
breakfast & in general food is good in all four restourants : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Rooms were not very spacious (I stayed in a premiere room), bathroom facilities were also not up to the mark : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Friday night seafood beach buffet was really good, I highly recommend it : []
Nusa Dua is so far from where we live, otherwise we would visit soon : []
We went there for honeymoon in Nov mid and I find this place amazingly beautiful : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
When we arrived to the hotel the staff was very friendly and helpful at the reception : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel has got the perfect balance of modern hotel whilst still maintaining the traditional Balinese style : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The rooms are probably getting a bit old, but are clean and spacious : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
From check in to check out the experience was very rewarding : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Firstly the rooms: two communicating rooms which were decent enough but could do with being updated and our bathroom desperately needed a renovation : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The staff were exceptional from check in to check out : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Our meals were delivered : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']

This is the same wherever you go outside of the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

the balinese frontage/structure as you enter the complex was already a sight to behold : [u'location', u'general']
All staff in the hotel was friendly and very helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The down side was mosquitos in the room, only having free wifi access in the lobby, expensive food and drink at the hotel, expensive hotel transport : [u'amenities', u'patio']
It has it's own section of beach which is decked out with beach chairs, the only draw back is that everyone reserves them with towels so unless you get in early you miss out : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We even got upgraded from a Deluxe Room to a Palace Club Room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The bathroom was vast, with a shower and a large double Jacuzzi : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Rooms are clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']

For dinner The Bali Collection shopping centre is a short walk (or free shuttle) away for a great selection of well priced restaurants with good quality food and some little boutique style shops and a department store : [u'amenities', u'gym']
THere are many pools to choose from : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Professionalism, helpfulness, friendliness and attentiveness of the Palace Wing Crew cannot be topped anywhere else : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
We tried the fried rice and perhaps I have had high hopes since most Indonesian establishments do a good fried rice, the ones I had falls short of expectation by quite a bit : []
One weakness was the serving staff at the restaurants especially in the pool area : [u'location', u'general']
the food was extremely variable, except for breakfast which was reasonable : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We ate 1 night in the Chess restaurant and had a table on the beach which was very nice : [u'amenities', u'conference']

The beach location is perfect : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The Tuesday night buffet with traditional Balinese dance was wonderful in their outdoor theatre (although the sucking pig was poor) : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The hotel has stood the test of time, it was opened around 1983 and is now undergoing some renovations, this however, did not cause any inconvenience to our stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They clearly hadn't been replaced whe the previous guest checked out : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
So if you want another Bali food experience than your hotel, walk 5 minutes along the beach path from Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, past Club Med, to Kendi Kunning restaurant and enjoy the genuine alternative, or walk past the security gate to go to a local Nusa Dua restaurant : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
BUT bit pricey : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff where so friendly and helpful : []
It's like there's never ending wow experience with this hotel : []
The rooms are new and all amenities supplied, free water in room : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
They arranged for musicians as well on our request!! The overall experience was amazing and incomparable : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I have stayed at the Westin over the past two years and the Lauguna and the Melia but I would say that the Nusa Dua didn't quite meet the same qualities as the others however the Deal was a reasonable one so that did help soften the blow : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
A safe beach to swim and a walking/running path along the beach between all the resorts, along with several pools which cater for kids and adults : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We were a group of 40 mostly Bali first timers looking for a top notch holiday : []
If you are on decaf, be prepared to have to repeat you order at least 3 times to different waiters before they bring it to you! The gala dinner was a let-down for that reason : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I couldn't pick a thing! May be more entertainment otherwise perfect! It was my first time in bali and it was great to escape husle into our little paradise : []
There was a pasta on the menu and one steamed chicken dish which were good, but we had to beg them not to add chips to every dish! Smaller, healthier meals would have been appreciated : []
The fitness centre is equiped with CYBEX fitness equipment (Excellent quality), they have a bank, small curios/pharmacy, Masjied (Prayer room for Muslims, a departure lounge with lockers, showers and entertainment as well as a kidies club : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Exactly Balinese style : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Well done : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I DONT RECOMMEND THIS ISLAND OR COUNTRY AT ALL : []
The location and the beach couldn't be better : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
After that though we decided we were enjoying a lovely (unusual) rest and relaxed and lounged around the pool, the beach, caught the shuttle to Bali Collection and we just really enjoyed our holiday : []
The shower was large and the bathtub had both a fixed faucet and the hand held type which became very important in the second half of the trip : [u'amenities', u'conference']
A child's bed was brought in we had to make changes using cushions and pillows : []
I do not have much to say : []
We also ate outside of the hotel by the main gate to nusa dua and at the bali collection, both of which were very good and better value : []
Most restaurants will offer you a taxi ride back if needed, but the walk is safe (police are stationed at regular intervals) and helps the lovely food go down : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We stayed for three nights with our 12 year old in the last week of May 2009 : []
Realistically, we know it is their job and we all put on a smile for our customers but you could genuinely feel their warmth : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room was slightly on the small size considering one child is almost an adult, but not an issue as room was clean and we had easy access to all amenities : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We have just come back from 10 days here (our second time) and had a fabulous break : []
The pool was fantastic and the restaurants served great food at pretty good prices for hotel food : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
However our hotel was great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Forget toast and because although great marmalade and jams they have no idea of toast (unless you like conrete consistency) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
An all day beach cleaning at the hotel would have been greatly appreciated : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
we stayed in the upgraded suites, stunning views, amazing staff and wonderful food : []
Every day we were greeted with smiles and attention to all of our needs : []

We loved the pools and swimming up to the bar for our drinks : []
We had a room on the 2nd floor and had a gorgeous view of the gardens : []
Our every request was listened too and any issue resolved immediately : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The proximity to other resorts provides choice of food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Take a taxi from inside Airport : [u'location', u'airport']
The chess bar servers delicious food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It is more traditional than the huge American Luxury Hotels built around it, giving a cool feel about it, & the beautiful Gardens are a real treat to wander through, relaxing & enchanting : []
Staff was polite, gardens beautiful, grounds quiet and well maintained though a bit old in some areas : [u'overall', u'safety']
using many of the facilities available at the hotel we have no complaints,it was a most relaxing holiday for my wife and I and we will come again : []
beautiful and big pool : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We loved the location, settings and general level of service : []
We stayed in the Palace Suites which provided additional free afternoon snacks and then free cocktails for an hour and a half every night : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The facilities are excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Suggest that the rooms be critically checked for wear and tear : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Looked forward to our stay only to come away extremely disappointed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The bathroom with rainfall shower is very nice and soothing : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Would like to have free internet in the rooms : [u'amenities', u'internet']
I believe this hotel was the first hotel in Nusa Dua, an enclave of exclusive resorts : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Local restaurants were within walking distance (about 10 minutes away) if you preferred to eat out : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the actual hotel was just amazing but what really made our stay so special was the staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
The private beach is very nice, and the water is quite : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Ok I didn't have a view of the beach but I still got a view of the beautiful grounds : []
So professional so flawless ThankYou everyone I was blessed this week : []
you may find your belongings removed if your lounge is unoccupied for 1 hour; : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
The only other time we took a taxi other than the Bluebird the guy demanded an extra 10,000 rupiah for his return journey to pay the toll but they go back via the normal roads any way : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Third, the food is delicious : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Accommodation was lovely, clean : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
Very quiet place to relax and just lay by the pool : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Moving swiftly we then decided to have the seafood BBQ which was nice : [u'amenities', u'conference']
There were not enough staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
keep kids out of their completely for it to be perfect : []
We booked this stay via a travel site, luxury escapes, were not sure what to expect, but were familiar with Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Epecially when you book for the Club part : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We had a great time and the facilities were excellent : [u'location', u'sea']
are charged extra) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The rooms were thoroughly cleaned every morning & again a quick clean in the evening : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The room was large, tasteful, and generally very clean (the bedsheets did have a very small stain when we first arrived - I am VERY particular about such things - but this was changed after I pointed it out and all our linens after that were clean) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was coming from both the resort restaurant construction, and the Westin next door, so I wouldn't stay there either : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
What disappointed us were the rooms: we booked superior rooms but found them quite cramped, especially the bathroom : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The were only a couple of negatives of the Hotel : [u'amenities', u'conference']
60 for a johnny walker & coke needless to say we didnt order one!! We had dinner at the chess restaraunt one night & the service was terrible & our order was incorrect & just for mains & a drink each it set us back over $120 : []
The room was okay, clean and nicely decorated, nothing amazing : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The hotel is situated right on the beach which is reached through very well maintained luscious gardens : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Staff very pleasant : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It may be one of the oldest properties in Nusa Dua but it is one of the best! : []
That's a bonus compared to the up, down, trip single- file scenario in other busy tourist destinations : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also, the locals will be selling souvenirs on the beach- just politely say 'no thanks : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Numerous reviews complained about the aircon, or the stickiness in the rooms : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The food was absolutely delicious and the birthday cake which they arranged was great too : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
No fresh milk for coffee and tea in mini bar only that awful powdered creamer - no top sheet only a feather quilt - our air conditioning was not working properly (set at 5 degrees and we were still not cool) so we ended up sleeping on top of the bed - we did mention this to Guest Relations but nothing appeared to change during our stay - I feel bad complaining as the hotel was wonderful to my husband who was ill with a chest cold but it did impact on our experience : []
when I asked at reception, the man was very rude and told me that nothing could be done bout my mothers problem in the shower and the wifi issue was my misunderstanding as its just not included then he walked off on me as I was communicating with him at the reception desk : []
Nusa Dua would be the place to stay if you want to just chill out and avoid the hussle bussle of Kuta : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Best selection of food I have seen in any hotel : []
positive: lovely staff, wonderfull environment, beautifully well maintained park, very nice room with wonderfull beds and pillows (important!), beautifull pools, decent food, lots of choice in food : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']

Great resort if you want to have everything at your fingertips : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

the room was very comfortable with a large bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The room we had was absolutely fantastic : []
The amazing beautiful place, the very friedly staff, the overall atmosphere was overwhelming : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

Couldn't pick up so many of them, and so got it from the other stack : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We left just as the main pool was closing, which would be something of a disadvantage, but the second pool was still available, as well as the children's areas : [u'amenities', u'conference']
With some packages you are treated differently not here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There's a lot of options for the breakfast, but if i could give a suggestion, please provide bread that are not made with eggs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Well done Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

Nice Hotel, good Spa and very good food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
food is average, service and amenities are good : [u'location', u'sea']
However, the spa manager was receptive to accept my idea of having massage in my own hotel room via the helpdesk lady : [u'overall', u'culture']
The grounds and pools are immaculate : [u'overall', u'safety']
Staff will happily call one for you : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Husband and I - second visit to this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We have no experience of the Palace club, but if it is better than the regular hotel, wow : []
We would particularly recommend Raja's for Balinese cuisine and excellent service : []
Airport transfer is a little expensive but it worth while to pay USD25 : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Bathrooms are tiny and although the fixtures seem to be new it looks like they just put the new fixtures in a badly designed bathroom : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We specifically want to say that Nona has been very helpful and pleasant to us, helping to solve minor problems, as has Fedelia in the past : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']

Overall is a great place to stay at the Nusa dua : [u'location', u'sea']
As beautiful as the resort is it is in need of an update : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The service was good when it was there, but sadly inconsistent : []
We felt very safe to have our 3 year old granddaughter Lilly with us : []
Also, there us not much to do after 10pm : []
i am satisfied dat i made a right choice by choosing dis hotel on my honeymoon trip : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
For cleanliness there is work to be done on the premier and palace rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The day spa is a must, this has recently been upgraded and a great way to indulge : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a premier room which was lovely and short walk to pool : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The private beach front area is possibly the best on this side of the island : [u'location', u'general']
Not very pleasant if trying to get an early nights sleep : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The NDBH delivers this : []
Only a cheap taxi ride from the airport, $7-8 depending on the traffic so don't worry about per booking transfers : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Considering the price, the food proposed was so so, PASTA for example !!! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Location wise we feel very comfortable there, a short walk to other venues and restaraunts and transport availiable if needed : []
I had hoped for more enthusiastic, welcoming and child focussed carers to entice my child who had never been to a kids club before : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The Club option is well worth the dollars spent with breakfast, afternoon tea, canapes and cocktails on a daily basis : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Such a shame and once again, no where near the 5 star quality that we indeed paid for : []
There was no construction we found going on : []

We took a Glass Boat ride and visited the Turtle farm, did some beach sports etc etc : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
This hotel is pricier than other places in Bali we have stayed, but we thought it was worth it : []
The staff seemed a little tired and lacking in Balinese graciousness could be the result of dealing only with westerners and international clients who expect their creature comforts : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Will strongly recommend taking breakfast option : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It gives you opportunity to have a walk down the beach, have a little peek or just have a drink in one of multiple beach bars : []
Unfortunately I am usually visiting Nusa Dua Beach Hotel while I am in Bali for business and I have never been there for a holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The hotel is one of the older ones on the Nusa Dua strip but really loved the balinese atmosphere of the hotel rooms and the beautiful gardens : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Nice hotel with beautiful garden : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Their spa area is massive, but the gym is quite small and the equipments need an upgrade : [u'amenities', u'gym']
I arrived and the computer system was down, I checked in eventually to a room without a bath, and as I was travelling with a baby, an important feature : [u'overall', u'culture']
Its older than some of the other Nusa Dua properties but don't let that put you off : [u'room', u'furniture']
often we stay half our time at your hotel and half at another one we always come away just loving the beauty of nusa dua beach hotel and spa we have recommended many of our friends to stay there and they all love it too : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Staff are so friendly willing to do anything for you : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The location itself is good, as is the staff who are friendly and helpful : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Friendly staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the room service was never to much trouble and anything from a bulb to be changed or not able to open our safe was dealt with in 10 mins the towels are changed up to 3 times a day with bedding every day ,a turn down service at night with a lady asking if she could run my bath for me : [u'overall', u'culture']
They gave coupons on arrival that we inevitably forgot to bring when we did eat in : []
We opted for a Palace Room which included a great choice of breakfast items, afternoon tea bewteen 3-5pm and cocktails and hor d'oeuvres between 5 : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Almost perfect, we had difficulty with wi fi and were a little disappointed it was not free : []
They are helpful, but seemed to lacked training and coaching for that 5 star touch, especially comparing to our experience visiting Laguna hotel and Sofitel, the service gap is particular apparent in Front Office and F&B : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This time we spent 10 days at the hotel and again stayed in a Club room with access to the Palace Club lounge : []
It's a great place for families or couples, the resort is kept immaculate and there are plenty of restuarants/bars : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff were very friendly and helpful from the outset : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
On arrival at Denpasar we had expected to be collected by the hotel as this was part of the online booking deal but although we had supplied our flight details the pick-up did not happen : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
This was our second visit to the hotel and we were as happy with it as the first : [u'amenities', u'patio']
They're well trained to offer us the best experience : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I thought they could have had a few nuts or cheese on offer during the day, however this is a very minor thing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was our 40th Wedding Anniversary and we had previously informed them of this and when we arrived in our room, we were greeted with a lovely basket of flowers with a congratulations note and a basket of fruit : []
Food was lovely a lot of choice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Staff were excellent, helpful and attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Our deal included some meals to match their special entertainment nights which were buffets : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We have enjoyed our stay here so much we would not hesitate coming here again : []
I found it very easy to stock up the bar fridge with cheap beers bought at the Mini Mark : []
We spent most of our time here under the trees lying in the sun with just the gentle breeze off the sea : [u'amenities', u'garden']
You will amaze with hotel design & decoration that show Balinese tradition : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed 8 nights as part of a luxury escapes package, and had the palace club upgrade : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Our daughter celebrated her 5th birthday while we were there & the Eka from Guest services did a fantastic job organizing a large chocolate cake for a party in the Gecko Kids Club to enjoy : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
All in all, the experience was absolutely faultless : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Our rooms, pool area, reception and lobby were very clean and staff available everywhere : [u'location', u'general']
We will defiantly be back : []
Perhaps a few 2-3 days at end of stay would be long enough rather than 10 nights : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Lovely setting : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel has so much to offer nothing is a problem , staff are so wonderful facility are outstanding level of service is second to none we can't wait to return for our 20th stay love nusa dua beach hotel and spa : []
We were there for our 10 day honeymoon and had a wonderful time from start to finish : []
As a vegetarian, I was suitably catered for as well as hubby who is a Coeliac : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Thank you again for looking after me : []
There shouldn't even be a TV in my opinion, and they certainly shouldn't be watching it when you have three staff members, two rooms full of toys, a playgound and a swimming pool at your disposal! Perhaps they should think about a booking-in system so at least they would know what activities they might do with those aged kids etc? Should be better kids meals available - I don;t think it is acceptable anymore to have a menu that is almost exclusively what i would call junk food (hotdogs, chicken nuggets) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Of course we had to pay a fee but it was discounted given the circumstances : []
- Wifi in room costs extra : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We can't wait to return : []
Excellent service, hotel traditonal style but all modern conveniences available, great location : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
If you want a quieter place set in manicured gardens and traditional Bali architecture then this place will do the job nicely : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Staff were exceptional : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Always when travelling in Bali only use a Bluebird cab as they are a metered cab and the drivers do not try to rip you off : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
This hotel is most definitely in the third rate, package tour category, and if this is the standard of room they put people in on short stays then they don't deserve passing business : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Check-out timing is pretty flexible even if you arrange for it last-minute, as in our case : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Again, the security checks at the entrance are a comfort : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Had 6 nights at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
You can also eat at the shopping complex called the Bali Collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Children in the Palace Club were a distraction and whilst we love children do not want them chasing around : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We are planning another trip next year with family : []
There is free wi-fi in the lobby (although not widely publicised : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We loved the location, buildings, gardens, beach and pool : []
We stayed in a Palace club room overlooking the beautiful ponds and temple which also meant we were located centrally to everything : []
We arrived late (past midnight) at night, the receptionist was not very friendly at check in : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
There were hundreds of them which proves that they're concern of the nature and it was an awesome and fun experience : []
Will come back again Nusa Dua Beach ^^ : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The buffet breakfast was very enjoyable with selections for all tastes : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Some of our group got caught in a strong current one day while swimming close to shore, within the safety buoys as marked, taking no risks : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
oh and the amazing breakfasts, JUST PERFECT!!!! : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The pool areas were great : [u'location', u'general']
If you want something else you can still get it and just pay for the additional amount so you are not restricted at all in what you can eat : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Wi fi was good in the foyer of the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Admitted in some places it could do with being refurbished but as when we were there it seemed some of the rooms were being referbished they obviously know this : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We already had high expectations on our return after getting married here 2 years prior and couldn't believe how the management and staff went above and beyond for us : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There was plenty of space for bags : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Overall a great relaxing break in a safe, well kept hotel : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The hotel charged us for in room wifi which we did not use at time of check out : []
Location and facilities fantastic, staff always happy and most helpful with any minor problems quickly sorted out : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Big, roomy, with an OUTSTANDING balcony : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
Great swim up bar with fabulous cocktails!! Free shuttle bus to Bali Collection is always great at all the hotels in Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
So I recommend this hotel to everybody who wants to enjoy their time in Bali with family : [u'amenities', u'patio']
There are other food outlets within the hotel as well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I have been there in 2009/2010 and just returned two days ago : []

The food is very good and the choice during breakfast is great : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Wifi in room is chargeable but lobby wifi is free to use : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Door catches in bathroom and robes did not work and the entire room was a little lacking in lustre : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Maybe a better system instead of paper tickets will do the job : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel felt crowded and there was an early morning race to try and get a sunbed (many failed as not enough) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Frayed towels, holes in poolside umbrellas, that kind of thing : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens', u'bathrobe', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
It was super : []
And you have to walk for 10 mins or so to get to any restaurants or stores outside the hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Watch out for whole chillies in the salad, I bit into one and it nearly spoiled my night : []
I just loved the breakfast area its juz so cool!Loved the elaborate breakfast spread : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Hawkers on the 'private beach' were a little annoying with the very scarce security not concerned at all : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Unfortunately, the weather was not funny all the time : [u'location', u'sea']
that was wonderful stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed at this hotel for my honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
My husband and I stayed in this resort for 5 nights with free transfers to and from the airport : [u'overall', u'culture']
We were sorry to leave after 10 nights : []
This hotel does give you free wifi with a speed on about 10mbs and free press reader downloads during your stay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Do not get a cab from the hotel they add 60% to the fare : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The is a bit of a rush of sunbeds between 11am - 2pm so sometimes you can end up on the beach without one : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Eight nights of luxury, nice suite in Palace Club though no view and building just outside room, however never really noisy : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
From the : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We enjoyed the bike hire - riding along the beach front, the lap pool in a quiet area, the gym and the massages : [u'location', u'general']
The beach was beautiful, nice and quiet : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The hotel complex is enormous and right on the beach : [u'location', u'general']
The cost of food and drinks in the resort is a little pricey for what we would have expected to pay in Bali : []
My wife and I hope to return in the future : [u'overall', u'culture']
The restaurants are handy and a good mix of food albeit on the high price side as are the drinks but we were happy to stay around there are drink and eat but you make your choice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Simply the management of this place takes care of each detail : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
will I go back - YES YES : []
In order to assist with continuous improvement there were a couple of things which could be acted upon : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The people are all smiles all the time and always ready to help : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
As such, we would prefer to stay somewhere safe and after reading reviews at tripadvisor, we chose Nusa Dua Beach hotel and Spa located along the beautiful nusa dua beach : []
The wedang jahe restaurant was my favorite : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our room wasn't ready until 5pm though : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Very good legong dinner : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
i recommend this hotel to evryone the one in group tours or couples the best place : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
very annoying : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This resort has the total package for the most relaxing holiday , palace club facilities our out standing if you haven't tried it do it ,such a friendly and welcoming management chefs and staff : []
I was not disappointed : []
This hotel has an authentic old world charm that a new five star hotel cannot replicate : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The points are more like: : [u'location', u'sea']
The hotel was comfortable, quiet and tidy : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We got Nusa Dua Beach Resort as part of a package : []
Also, the spectacular gardens, pools, spa and recreation/activities helped to make our holiday one of the best yet! : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Staying at Nusa Dua with a 17 year old son and 14 year old daughter was perfect as the beach water is clean and swimable, more often than not : [u'amenities', u'pool']
There is ample security at this resort making you feel safe and secure : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We have never before had such a wonderful experience in Bali - the hotel is very reasonably priced for all it has to offer- beautiful grounds, beautiful pools, extremely comfortable room, helpful and friendly staff and the most amazing buffet breakfasts : []
If this is your first time to Bali, we highly recommend that you bring CRISP currency notes from your country : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I have to say that the service here was exceptional and unlike most 'clubs' there was table service although for cereals, fruit etc : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
At the same time if you are a sight seeing person and use it for just sleeping and occasionally using the facilities like I did I wouldn't recommend : []
In particular the housekeeping were very polite and always left the room beautifully clean during the morning and evening visits : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Lovely room with large bathroom with bath and comfortable tasteful furniture : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
There are 4 restaurants in the hotel and they are all good : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
hotel is the oldest in nusa dua,beds,TV,bathroom re from other century, terrible : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There are several pools that cater for varying tastes, ranging from toddlers to those who like volley ball and then just to swim and enjoy a cocktail at the swim up bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Suitable for couples who want to relax and not leave the resort : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Nusa Dua location would not be ideal if you are looking to have something to do at night : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall, what we love is the bedroom that is so comfortable! The bathroom is being part of what we love about it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed at the Nusa dua beach resort for 9 nights at the end of April in the Palace Club rooms : []
12 luxury hotels line up on a great beach front with a nice open plan shopping centre in the middle : [u'amenities', u'patio']
But hey, your on vacation so splurge and enjoy I say : []
We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is more a review of my experience rather than the hotel itself : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room was very spacious clean and very well equipped even down to our own coffee maker : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
For this reason I cannot recommend this hotel at all : []
Will be back for sure! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We travelled to Bali in June and stated at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for 9 nights : []
And to top it off I was charged twice for a transfer to the airport which I only realised later : []
Will be left with beautiful memories : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thank you for all your wonderful service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Starting from the fact that you were met as a best friend, treated like a distinguished guest, and, finally, seen off in a way that you would like definitely to come back to Nusa Dua once again : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Can't wait to return! :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) : []
4) The sliding door to the garden was also stuck half the time : [u'amenities', u'conference']
prepare to 'relax' by the pool listening to hammers, saws, etc : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Had some trouble using the wired internet, but the admin guy was quick to solve the problem & get me connected : []
Getting a taxi out to the city is top $ price no bargaining : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Don't let the "porters" grab your bags after the luggage carousel, its a scam and they just want a large tip : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We recommend this r escort for families, if you don't have kids and fancy for night life, pick a hotel from Kuta : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Buffet breakfast was very good as to be expected from Nusa Dua resorts, and room service was comparable to pricing within resort restaurants making it very convenient to dine in room : []
This is a hotel to relax and be pampered : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff at the Palace Club were all brilliant, couldn't have been more friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Traffic jams to enter or to go out Nusa dua are usual and really boring each time you plan excursions : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Every little extra had been thought of in the access rooms with wide doorways, lower furniture, great walk in shower and fold out cushioned shower chair : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
* A service fee is attributed to all purchases at the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
This was my second visit to this resort this year : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Drinks are a bit pricey and they seem to have a strange way of adding taxes and service charge to some stuff in advance and not others : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Highlight was the breakfast - best i've had in Bali! : []
Food was of high quality and was the themed dance/ dinner nights : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The hotel is in good condition, I believe it has had a refurb a few years ago, and I couldn't spot a thing wrong with it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our 4 years old daughter were having such a blast in the pool, beach, and the cute squirrels roaming about the garden : [u'overall', u'culture']
Nice swimming pools that fit many : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
they must have about 20 staff always working in the gardens everyday to keep in trim : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
nothing is too much trouble and they can't do enough for you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I really don't mind few hanging around because I love what they sell : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
You can also book hotel taxi for an 8 hour session to bring you around : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The big stone gate in the front really shows this hotel's balinese touch : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
I did not book this place,this is the place I was given when I booked a package deal with Singapore Airlines,I would had booked the Grand Hyatt or the Hard Rock Hotel in Kuta : []
Despite this, I am happy to give it a 4/5 rating! : []
few different place to eat and romantic dinner very nice on beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Me and my husband are staying in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our Honeymoon : []
The beach is clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']

This hotel is fine if you are happy staying in a huge resort that could be anywhere in the world : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All in all a very relaxing stay : []
Was lovely but had a bit of a odour and slightly run down around the bathroom (2219) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Would certainly recommend this resort, and the upgrading to Palace Club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Restaurant prices were very high ($75+ for two adults and two kids sharing burgers and water) : []
Be prepared to see a lot of British families there as well : [u'overall', u'culture']
The rest of the hotel is nice - large but not too big : [u'amenities', u'patio']
$$$ Walk down the road and grab a Blue cab there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Would strongly recommend especially the Chess Bar and Restaurant at Happy Hour! : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
There is a feeling of a strong push to consume and there is not much for free : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Happy Travels! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had certain perks, amazing breakfasts, free afternoon tea and cocktail hour : []
The new chef and F&B director have made eating there an absolute incredible experience, every meal at any of the 5 restaurants is a winner ! The pools are lovely, great now that you can get bar/food service by the pools and beach areas - the beach is clean and private , and the gardens a delight to walk in : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The bed was very comfortable however a couple of the pillows were rather hard for myself and my fiance : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
he is a pro : []
There is a small shopping centre called Bali Collections about a 15min walk away with little restaurants and abit of shopping, I didn't eat here, it looked abit dodgy : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
Would recommend a premier poolside room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
You may enjoy swimming in the pool and sitting by the beach, but know that you will not experience Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We cannot wait to return for another visit soon : []
But is perfect for Honeymooners and those looking to just sit and relax : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Called reception to notify them that as I have no babies, I don't see why there's a cot in the middle of the room, and obviously there's been a mix up as someone else is probably waiting for it : []
The place could do with a sprucing up , but I am not complaining : []
A relaxing experience in a beautiful garden setting with the most helpful of staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Our previously ordinary holiday at the other resort melted away and we were able to relax and feel we had been on a good restful break : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The hotel provides good balance between fun and tranquility wrapped in a very comfortable staying and perfect people to help and greet you around : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We came here for our honeymoon and stayed for 3 days, had a wonderful time, we got delayed by 2 hrs due to immigration but our cab driver was still there waiting for us at the airport, great service indeed, the private beach was perfect for spending a lazy afternoon, the buffet breakfast was really good and had great variety, however we did find a lack of options in the restaurant menu, after a point there weren't a lot of options to try from, but all in all a really great experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In saying that though, we would definitely return in the future the beach the gardens the food and last but not least the staff make our holidays what they are and we will treasure the memories from each one : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We came to hotel without making booking and friendly bellboy help us with our luggage to reception desk : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
A beautiful blend of traditional Bali and luxury, away from the madding crowd! This resort is well-designed and we enjoyed our stay immensely : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One of the reason being that the hotel was located away from the city : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The bed needs to be at the same height as the wheelchair : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
Very unique flavors of ice cream : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Now, I did not mind the duck pond view, but the noise at sun-up was more alarm clock than I wanted : []
Returned October 2014 with my husband and again treated as though we were the only guests in the complex : []
The bed linen was stained : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
during my honeymoon I didn't feel that I am in honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
The pool is heated and huge : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
would come back in a heartbeat : [u'amenities', u'patio']
the staff were amazing and don't know how to say no : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Our rooms were on the Palace Club side but we did not opt for the palace club upgrade : []
I haven't used it at all and the hotel could just check it from the room number : []
The pool is really warm, lucky my little 5 years old mad scientist brought thermometer, so we got some readings on Sept : []
If any deal offers fast track through the airport (immigation) then forget it : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It is decorated with flowers and towels are folded into quirky animal shapes : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Our experience was exceptional from the moment we arrived until we departed : []
You then need to fill a glass with milk (at one drip per second) to take to your table to enable you to get some sugar on before the milk : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I personally found the hotel massive, it is huge and it was quite crowded at the time we were there (first week of May), resulting in a not so intimate atmosphere : []
Swimming pool is very nice too : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Kuta is the more fun, happening, noise, shopping, party : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The hotel ground was charming with a nice traditional Balinese flair : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Check my report on this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I would recommend getting a manicure or a massage : []
This is a great place for a honeymoon or for couples looking for a more quiet and relaxed location away from the crowds at other Bali destinations : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I strongly suggest that management secretly try the fare they offer and draw their own conclusion : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The Indonesian restaurant offered good quality food but was quite expensive : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The exception was the breakfast buffet : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
No bustling town disturbance - very quiet location : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
- the resort has lots of balinese features, the gardens are awesome! : [u'amenities', u'garden']
- Excellent spa service at the Hotel (very convenient) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It was interesting to learn he also managed another hotel we have stayed in at Tuban and it is clear he bought his skills to this hotel as nothing could be faulted : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For survey, please use "NOT APPLICABLE" as well : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We manage a 5 star hotel and had to find somewhere nice for a break - this did the trick : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Friendly cheerful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room was cleaned to perfection daily with a fruit basket every second day featuring fresh tropical fruits : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The Nikko didn't have the same taxi policy!! It's nothing in Aussie dollars and we're not 'tight' - we always upped the taxi fare to either 50,000 or 100,000 for the taxi drivers regardless - I just prefer to tip the driver rather than the hotel!! ) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
To us it was NOT an upgrade as we did not have the pool view only garden and we were not interested in using club facilities as we wanted to be with our friends for breakfast and evening cocktails not stuck in a room without them : []
We stayed in a Premier room in the west Agung Garden wing of the hotel, overlooking the garden and small lake- it was truly a joy to awake to the sounds and sights of tropical birds, cheeky squirrels, other wildlife and the fountain in the lake : []
Accommodation spacious, location central to shops and relaxation, beach and centre of Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The biggest,best breakfast ever ! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was only a few days later that The Guest Relations representatives reached out to me to see how they could help make his day as memorable as possible : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
But it didn't take long to change our moods : []
It was a lovely stay for all family, very relaxed,peaceful and enjoyable! : []
Bali collection is very near by and there's a free shuttle that makes rounds to the hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are mutilple restaurants and bars, and with the Westin etc next door if you get tired of the hotel cuisine, walk for 30 seconds on the beach and try somewhere else : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We love the location and atmosphere : []
We ended up doing it all ourselves via viator : []
Perfect for what we wanted as it was away from the busy parts of bali and we could basically stay at the resort the whole week : []
they love it very much : []
The hotel was 100% full while we were there so service was slow at times but no major problem : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This is our second time to your resort and we loved it just as much as the first time will definately be coming back looking forward to seeing what the new bar and restaurant looks like when completed : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Our room (2219 i think??!!) was fabulous, a separate nook for the kids (a curtain dividing their section off from ours would have been wonderful!), a massive balcony, and because we were above 2 restaurants, we could link up to the hotels free wifi in our room, BONUS!! Only complaint about room was the bathroom, it was so, so small : []
* many seaweeds in the sea that made swimming not very confortable (but similar to all beaches of the area) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The choice of restaurants is good, and you are very close to one of the large shopping complexes with food and retail outlets which does a shuttle bus to the hotel : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Three nights was enough to unwind in Bali before leaving for home : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Staff was friendly very helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had bought a package which included a few extras which made the value excellent : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Only problem with this hotel is that it is a stand-alone property with no restaurants, bars or spas within walking distance : []
(If you go there, you should try the pool bar cocktails : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I had my wedding there few days bac with over 100 pax : []
Try the palace club room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
They too thoroughly enjoyed their time and were never bored - even partaking in the hotel's cooking course at Raja (Indonesian quisine) - highly recommended and fabulous food as is Maguro's (Asian quisine) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Wont be able to comment much on food quality as we were roaming around and hardly had any meals at the hotel (except breakfast - which is decent) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Afternoon tea and cocktails and all dinners included plus 3 theme shows : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
but if you want a chilled break with good service and everything in the complex (including shops, bank, hairderesser etc) I would recommend it : []
The hotel is a great balance of resort retreat and family friendly : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The big thing is Nusa Dua is a little sleepy, and more equipped for families with little kids : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is only an 8 min walk which you fell very safe other wise a taxi if people dont want to walk : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The staff are courteous & offer a gracious Balinese charm : []
If you look peaceful quit 5star beach on bail, the Nusa dua is really the best choice : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The pool and the beach is nice, we swam in the pool and in the sea until noon : []
I received top care in this very modern hospital : []
The whole resort is beautifully maintained the food is sensational ,the Spa treatment are incredible so if your looking for a wonderful stay in Bali I can "HIGHLY" recommend NUSA DUA BEACH & SPA RESORT the only negative is having to leave BUT we will be back : []
however the best and cheapest place for shopping is KUTA : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
A little cheap in my opinion : [u'room-experience', u'view']
Total of 5 rooms i booked were located just beside the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
So much for all ages to do : []
The staff was fantastic : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Come here if you want to spend your time getting spa treatments, swim in the pool and be pampered : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A great hotel that we would love to come back to : []
A long and frustrating call to the hotel concierge didn't help (their English and my Bahasa are questionable) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
But the service is not : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The only points to improve on would be: : [u'location', u'sea']
My wife and I went to Bali for 10 days for our honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
Bartender at the pool was great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The Spa is located in a superb surrounding with a nice isolated pool away from main building : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
From that point the service throughout was faultless , with the staff going out of their way to ensure that anything and everything that could be done was done in a cheery no fuss style : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- The restaurants are top-notch, we ate almost every night at Raja's, with enough variation on the menu to have a different meal each night : []
We would love to return : []
We go to Bali regularly and know the area and thought we'd try a different resort to where we usually stay : []
The extensive Cocktail list was the best we have ever encountered in any lounge : []
I like having a separate bath and shower, the range of TV channels is second to none and there is a private ground floor balcony : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
Hello to the Dutch couple we met and told us about the orpanage : []
We asked an extra bed, and there was no extra charge for the bed, only US10 per day for extra breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Maintenance men were coming in and out and finally had to get in the shower and open all the holes in the shower head as they were all broken and the fridge thermostat was broken : [u'amenities', u'conference']
room was large enough and my room with garden view was amazing with enough sun! breakfast was excellent : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I can't believe I am sitting just feet from a tropical landscaped pond with resident heron and monitor lizards and not a single mosquito : []
The Ramayana dance and buffet evening is good value and in a spectacular setting : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Great staff, very kind : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Wonderful ppol and beach orientation - vs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I think it is not so important to clean very well every day but when the room gets an new quest it is very important that the rooms should be cleaned well so that the first impression in good ! : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
All and on I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody coming to Bali : []
Special mention of the helpfulness of the staff (Yarnie & Kartia at the airport) : [u'location', u'airport']
Best regards, : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The spa area is fantastic : [u'location', u'general']
Room size is not great but not small either with modern amenity : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We had access to the Palace Club where our breakfast was served, menu style : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Breakfast was alway enjoyable not only because of the variety of food but the magnificent surroundings : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The Resort itself is a great concept just in need of renovation as it is a bit dated : []
You have the option of picking them up for lunch, or order room service (at a price) for them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We loved every minute of our stay - very happy with all of the facilities - the Spa was magic and the best part of the trip : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The hotel also has a private well kept beach on the lovely warm Indian Ocean : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It was a family friendly place, that made for a very relaxing holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed 10 nights in early June/July this year : []
I had requested an upgraded room and was surprised that one of my tour guests in a standard room had a larger, ocean view room - by comparision, mine was small and overlooked the duck pond : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Every one of our requests was met with a "yes" and a smile : []
We just enjoyed lazing by the pools and the beach then sipping cocktails at the beach bar! We also ventured outside the main gates to eat a few times into Nusa Dua Village : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Recently visited Bali and stayed at a few places but ended this trip at Nusa Dua Beach hotel - was not disappointed : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
The sea here is great, protected by a reef and although the tide goes quite a way out and drops quite a bit, the sea is swimmable for a fairly long period : [u'location', u'sea']
How does an old hotel maintain its character? It is not just the surroundings, which are spectacular, but the people that work there! A truly memorable experience, 10 out of 10! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I must say they were not Balinese! Apart from this group of arrogant chiefs who are only contracted on and might not be there for long, this place was fantastic : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Gin and his beautiful staff were so friendly and attentive and couldn't have made us feel more welcome : []
We would definitely return to this hotel again, it is so relaxing and the lovely grounds of the hotel are so well kept whilst retaining their natural charm, it would be a challenge not to relax : []
Wouldn't stop us returning though! The Palace Club inclusions and standard is just fabulous : []
This hotel lives up to the full meaning of a "resort : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Excellent service and high quality restaurants and food : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We married at Nusa Dua in April : []
With the people and staff we met during our stay, we had the best 10 days in a very long time : []
Finally got the room which looked old and tired with cosmetic patch up in places : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The house keeping was faultless & we had our bottled water replenished each day complimentarily : [u'room', u'furniture']
The hotel is completely self-contained with various restuarants on-site all serving good food at reasonable western prices (though not like prices in Legian restaurants) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Definitely worth a stay! Top service, breakfast and a lovely hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall, I wasnt too bad but fairly expensive for bali : []
The Bali ppl are very polite and nice, the beach near hotel is clean and good view : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We thoroughly enjoyed the beauty, service and feel of this resort : []
Just need the Exec Chef to address the overall standard in buffet dinners and Maguro as well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Hotel room was nice and clean with great service with fresh towels and clean sheets everyday and the King Bed was so comfy! : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
However our deal included a butler and were heard from him on the Night (phone) before we were going home asking us if we needed anything and he asked if we wanted a meal ticket for dinner as we were leaving : []
Very enjoyable stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were fantastic and the facilities of the Palace Club were very good indeed : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I didn't go in swimming though, as I saw some garbage around : []
More expensive than kuta/seminyak : []
I recently stayed at Mulia Bali - a spanking new facility with a ultra premium price tag and it was a terrible experience( you may see my review on it elsewhere in this site) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The snacks could be improved upon also : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
and the proximity of the beach is a bonus : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The taps around the basin were not cleaned properly, mould in-between the tiles in the shower and bathroom, the taps of the both would fall off in your hand rendering the bath useless : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Located in a very safe compound containing all five stay hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
1) The resort is very isolated in its own area with security checkpoints to enter the area and to enter the hotel grounds : [u'overall', u'safety']
I'm sure the new food and beverage manager will sort this out : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The restaurants serve a good variety of food and the prices are reasonable : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
My husband and I spent 3 nights here after 2 weeks stay in Malaysia as a second trimester pregnancy break : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Eating at Chess on the beach at night was a wonderful experience : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The spa amenities are very nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The hotel is located in the Nusa Dua area of Bali and has its own stretch of private beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Aside from that, it was a great place to stay with a decent kids club, pool bar and babysitting available : []
As for the hotelNusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa was excellent with the exception of the food service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff were wonderful and the breakfast and room service was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We had to pay to hire DVD player & internet access : []
We had no problems with noise that others complained of : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Although we were in high season the buffet never felt crowded or crazy : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Very hospitable hotel staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
i could go on and on about this hotel as we had a such a memorable time : []
10 minutes walk to a large shopping centre and restaurants (Bali Collection) or get the free transfer : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The breakfasts are lavish as are the restaurant meals : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
5 hours in the afternoon, followed shortly afterwards, by cocktails and hors d'oeuvres : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
And you're probably better off there as well in terms of quality! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room was very nice, spacious with big balcony : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
But for those who value a good spread for breakfast will be disappointed : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Another time a sand castle competititon was scheduled, but guess what, only my daughter was there - no prizes for guessing what she spent the next hour doing : [u'overall', u'culture']
00pm, but as the hotel was not heavily booked staff had, without being asked, assigned us a room straight away; very much appreciated : []
Breakfast was also extremely good, with a huge choice from several cuisines : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There are some new facilities under construction so this resort will only get better! : [u'amenities', u'pool']
I should have asked for firmer pillows, as we are not used to such fluffy soft pillows : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
A good hotel in an expensive area which formed the base for our Holidays in Bali : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This was our 2nd stay at NDBH following our amazing wedding there 5yrs ago : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
The service was also wonderful; all the hotel employees were very very nice and profesional : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
i like beach and swimming pool ,but only the think toilet room : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The area is large, so many luscious garden surroundings ahh feel so natural along with a duck pond, squirrels, kids area and swimming pools to tranquil yourself : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
45am returned to the front desk : [u'room', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'conference', u'elevator', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk', u'post-room', u'checkout']
it was the finishing touches which made it really special i : [u'amenities', u'conference']
In my opinion there needs to be a mix : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
An extra plus is the beach the hotel is lying next to : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The pool area was lovely - we spent most of our day lounging by the pool, swimming or propping up the pool bar (the spiced strawberry mojitos were amazing!) : [u'amenities', u'patio']
There are MNAY restaurants to chose from & we did not have a single bad experience in any : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
We had a lovely relaxing holiday : []
Definetly recommend for families too : [u'overall', u'culture']
We have never experienced such warmth any were in the world can't wait to return : [u'overall', u'culture']
This hotel is typical of those in Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Stayed for 2 nights with wife and child : [u'overall', u'culture']

A great place to relax and splash out on that luxurious touch : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We will be bringing back friends and family for more stays : []
Nusa Dua had their own private beach which is very spacey and well maintain : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We are not even sure if it even meets this 4 star grade : []
As advised by some reviewers we requested for a quiet room not facing the construction site nearby as it can get noisy : []
The floor in the room are parquetry and badly scratched : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
well away from the hustle and bustle, but still plenty to occupy the mind and body : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Air con was a relief (the poor air con at our previous accommodation had to work very hard to just offer a slight chill to the air), bed and pillows were great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
We are going back in Sept 06 and are counting the days : []
This was the most exotic vacation I ever had and Nusa Dua Beach Hotel just added to the mystic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
At night it is a wonderful setting as is the beach restaurant : []
Didn't eat dinner in the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
Plenty of sun lounges but as usual you need to get in early to get a good spot : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The last time we went to Nusa Dua was in 2001 and stayed there for 10 nights : [u'location', u'sea']
Jogging every morning along what seemed like an endless beachfront trail provided more than enough exercise : [u'location', u'mountains']
Ask for a Bluebird taxi, not hotel taxi at front taxi rank : [u'room-experience', u'view']
The spa is outstanding and services there are unrivaled world wide : [u'overall', u'culture']
We only ate at restaurants twice, as they were quite expensive (around the same price as Aus) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
nothing is too much trouble and the facilities a delight : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We are already planning our return next year : []
The theme dinners were a lot of fun and walking along the quiet Nusa Dua coast line at night with my partner was very romantic : [u'overall', u'culture']
No free mini bar however and all drinks and food had to be consumed at club : [u'amenities', u'patio']
It really bothered me to see the beach cleanser sweeping up the grass and trash and burying it in the sand : []
A good job then, that distances on the island are small : [u'location', u'sea']
Good beach and friendly staff Great for kids any age : [u'overall', u'culture']
All our expectations were met and beyond : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The service at the hotel was outstanding and nothing was ever too much trouble for the staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall it was a great stay! I will be back 100% : []
I just came back yesterday from Bali, where I stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
Staying at Nusa dua beach hotel and spa was a wonderful experience !! Friendly staff , beautiful food , amazing location : [u'overall', u'feel']
There was two large pool, never crowded and big enough for swimming, great pool bar and plenty of sunbeds : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Why in the world do they offer free wi-fi in all public areas of the hotel whereas you will be charged 10 USD a day for using internet in your room? By doing so they only annoy their customers unnecessarily : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A terrible end to a beautiful holiday!!! Awful hotel, very unhelpful staff who knew nothing about their own facilities or the local area : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The beaches are by far the best : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Excellent stop over to complete our holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We got exactly what we wanted - a clean, quiet and relaxing place, right on the beach : []
for families, friends and couples this is a great place to stay, try the spa which is amazing, or the Lobby bar for a cool cocktail or simply chill out on the beach or at the pool and enjoy a bintang : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It would take around 50,000 Rp to discovery shopping centre with bargan taxi at outside gate of hotel : []
I and my girlfriend stayed here in june for two weeks : []
Dined at their popular Chess Beachfront restaurant and recommend you book to secure a spot on the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Excellent hotel - grounds & facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff was great! However, F&B had some problem coping with the crowd during peak season : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
While most of the hotel staff are friendly and attentive, I experienced some unpleasant situations: 1) at the time we arrived, nobody took initiative to take out our luggage from our car, I even need to asked for a valet parking before a hotel officer came to take my car; 2) when having our breakfast, nobody offered us with tea or coffee like a normal 5 stars will do, but I noticed that the waiters were serving other foreign guests; and 3) at the day we checked-out, at 12 : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The Palace Club food was frequently cold, the breakfast menu was not as good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I stayed at this Hotel in March 2015 : []
Quality is very much so and so : [u'overall', u'safety']
It is a hotel we would like to return to : []
The resort was so beautiful, the staff pay great attention to the gardens and maintaining the building : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We arrived mid to late in the evening and on first impressions thought "WOW" : []
Then came the evening cocktails and food, beautiful, I had my fair share of Martini's sitting outside looking over the lovely garden and ponds, lovely way to finish the day : [u'amenities', u'garden']
We would stay again : []
Well, long story short, they gave us a room, but we were not treated as "honeymooners" just as regular customers : []
mail is susan_colin22@hotmail : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
And thankful, the hotel has a mini mosque, so it making easier for me to pray : []
Thank you again - and we will be back!! It really was perfect for us : []
The seating furniture on the terrace was marked and stained and needs replacing : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'conference']
I hv try all the restaurant at the hotel : []
A really nice relaxing holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Little disappointed this time : [u'location', u'sea']
Yes, it is expensive but when booking a 5 star then surely that is to be expected : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Adi rang the assistant manager on duty : [u'amenities', u'conference']
As it was a 1st floor corner suite the balcony was massive and over looked the well maintained and beautiful gardens : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
From the spa/sports centre you can also hire bikes, which we did one morning : []
Generally the area is nice very picturesque : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel was a complete surprise : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The bathrooms are musty, and the water in the lavatory pan stays on the floor : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The staff all over the hotel were unfailingly polite, and all spoke good English, so we had aboslutely no problems on that front : []
Yes, there was a bit of work going on in the hotel but this didn't inconvenience us in the slightest (they were renovating the roof above one half of the lobby bar and a few of the rooms) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The level of attention we were given made us feel like royalty : []
We insisted that we paid before and wouldn't be paying again : []
Stayed in a Palace Club room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
It was 8 nights in a royal suite : []
The staff could not do enough to help regardless of where they worked or what you needed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast in the Palace Club lounge was very peaceful but the pancake there was so disappointing, far less my avarage : []
the beach was average and pool was nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Thanks to all the staff for making our time very memorable for the right reasons : [u'location', u'sea']
I took a walk along the beach and there are other hotels all the way along and i wouldn't say that any other hotels in nusa dua are better than the beach and spa resort : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
A previous reviewer stated that the beach was dirty, but what they didn't say was that the Indian Ocean is quite rough and there is rubbish that is washed up on the coastline in the morning, (like everywhere else) but the hotel have beach cleaners who clear up every last bit of this : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The Italian style restaurant by the pool was much better : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The restaurants at the hotel were ok : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
I suggest management find out how the competition is doing in this department : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We have stayed here before however this package made it all the more better : []
Special thanks to everyone at the hotel starting with reception "front desk" & ending with housekeeping : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
You are handed 2 vouchers and after more advertising chatter are told to open the vouchers up and low-&-behold, you have won a FREE trip to the hotel for a 3 night stay and sometimes even a cash reward of $X : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staffs were very attentive and kind and gave us 3 welcome drink vouchers : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Much to my amusement, a squirrel ran up my husbands leg while on the beach leaving scratch marks on his legs : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It was genuinely touching to be remembered afer 14 years by several of the Palace Club staff : []
My experience at the Nusa Dua Beach resort was a good one mainly because of the location with beach access and beautiful gardens : [u'overall', u'feel']
If you want to see the sunsets then head for Jimbaran or Uluwatu which are both about 30 minutes away in a taxi : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They have multiple restaurants on the property : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
All the staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful and well trained : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
So we cannot get any advantages of the Leaders Club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
No swimming in the sea after 2 PM, low tide : []
We ventured out many times during our stay & found it very easy to obtain a driver (who we paid directly) : []
Arrived at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for the last three days of our ten day holiday for total rest and relaxation : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Our room was big and bright, looking out to the lovely gardens : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We stayed at they club room on the ground floor with an amazing room that opened into the lawns : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms where nice and clean : [u'location', u'general']
Everything about our stay at the Nusa Dua went above our expectations and by check out we were already planning our next visit : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Everyone, including the cleaners, were friendly and courteous and provided first class service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast is ordinary which could be served by 3-4 stars hotel, they will charge you for ordering fruit juices other than papaya and watermelon juices, while daily served breakfast is limited and menu is exactly the same everyday, i get bored with the served breakfast on the 3rd day while i stayed at the hotel : []
I would recommend this hotel for a couples 25+ as it is the perfect place to relax and wind down, in our case wind down from a week of busy Legian : []
Another fantastic trip the renovations look great, the spa centre is beautiful, as was the newly tiled pool : [u'amenities', u'gym']
There are no touts here because it's a private beach : []
things just kept getting worse and worse, the guy who came to change our sheets told us that it was moist from the aircon but we'd been out for the last few hours and the air con was off : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
It's a very well maintained property with lots to explore : []
There were further renovations still going on while we were there (rooms only), but although we were told there was work going on, we did not hear a thing! We would definitely recommend this hotel and hopefully we will be able to return there for another holiday in the future : []
However, it could be even better if it was cleaned before admitted for tourists : []
Spa and adult pool Devine : [u'overall', u'culture']
The clerk didn't seem to believe this, and said she would email us if, once the computers were up and running, it should show that we owed them anything : []
Would not hesitate to return to this hotel, for a very relaxing holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
I absolutely loved its close proximity to the water, the beach was truly beautiful to wander past via the walkway between all of the hotels, and I enjoyed the short walk to the waves at the end of the resorts where I could have a dip too : []
The hotel is too big and too noisy - too many people with children who make loud noise even during very early morning! Hard to find a seat during breakfast time : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The staff were extremely helpful, cheerful and eager to please, and always had a smile : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The rooms are of a good standard , the staff are very helpful , and the location is in our opinion the best in Nusa Dua : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The leisure facilities are outstanding : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our original room was a family room with a bathroom the size of a shoe box which was the reason for my survey rating : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The Lagoona is beautiful, ideal for honeymooners/ couples : [u'amenities', u'pool']
I was immediately impressed on arrival by the warmth and reception I received on arrival : []
Staff was very friendly, the room was ok although the shower could be more convenient : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
The staff are excellent & we love the extra attention staying in the Palace club : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Very friendly and helpful staff, great service, always smiling : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A short walk away to a few shops, which sold many spices to take home, incredibly cheap especially vanilla pods : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We would recommend this pretty hotel especially to anyone trying to stay within a budget : []
Prepare to rise early to get a sunbed : []
You walk in the front door and you would think you have walked into David Jones or Myers : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
From arrival to departure the ethos of the staff, be it room, restaurant, pool or top management was one of service, friendship and efficiency : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The rest of the hotel was more encouraging : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Breakfast was lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Take a bike ride along the Nusa Dua seafront with open access to all the other hotels in the area : [u'location', u'general']
We rang the front desk and after 20 mins of waiting the housekeeping service remade the bed to a kingsize : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We arrived there very much in need of nurturing and a stress free holiday and this was achieved : []
The rooms were decent and we were upgraded after we had complained about the plumbing in the original room : []
simply yummy!! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
2) if you are staying in a deluxe room with garden view, the terrace seems a little exposed and if it rains (which it does a lot in Bali during this season) there is no protection for you to sit out and watch a good rain (which we love to do) : []
The hotel is very big with 3 pools and various restaurants in the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Everything about this hotel was perfect from the moment we arrived : []
If a big resort is what you are after then it's a good choice : []
Apart from the included breaky only had a couple of meals in the hotel (which were very nice) but prices higher than eating out at Tanjung Benoa or Bali Collection : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The room was good, staff was friendly, and the Environment was amazing : [u'overall', u'culture']
Drinks are pretty expensive though : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel has a lovely feel to it : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This is the first time I have ever stayed in a hotel where you didn't have music booming out, or excessive noise of any kind from the beach, to the pool and the public bars and restaurants, it was shear heaven : []
Breakfast is served as you like it, just order whatever you want : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We complained and were moved to another room which was an improvement but was not as nice as a 3* place we had just come from in Legian (for half the price)! : []
As a result we missed the garden walk from being told 4 different schedules : []
Definitely recommend this hotel and hopefully coming back soon! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I'm not sure if i would go back to NDBH, the hotel itself and the staff were all wonderful, unfortunately they book in large groups of Russian who are extremely rude and let their kids run riot around the pools and restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Never ever fall for some of the cons though where you get into a conversation and eventually asked "What is you program for tomorrow?" : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
Loved the swim up pool bar - always a bonus : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It has nothing to do with the kids club thing : []
We went for a couple service, which provides includes massages with Balinese creams, and the masseurs leave the two of you to enjoy in private the facilities, including a pool, a Jacuzzi and sauna : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Thiswas absolutely perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But there are many available tour experiences to book if desired, but if not, this hotel provides relaxation, beach side setting, fine dining and efficient staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Well, we had nothing to fear : []
The hotel itself is beautiful and has some facinating features, it appears almost like a sacred ground in places, the ancient stone features are amazing and the hotel has a grand feeling to it : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
it was well worth the price as the room was very big, with a draped bed, separate bath, power shower and toilet : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
What an amazing culture and what amazing and kind people : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff were very helpful and welcoming, we will be back : []
Excellent resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua WAS a bargain : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Thank you all at the Nusa Dua Beach and Spa : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Our travel style is very much non stop with plenty of exploring : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I have no complain ! : []
Staff are excellent, rooms were clean and thoughtfully set up and the overall facilities pretty much cater to those who want to stop and just relax : [u'amenities', u'patio']
They did not care no matter what you said they answered YES YES The smoking also happened around they pool several days in a row : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The facility and the service was great, I asked something for room service in the middle of the night and they were quick serve us : []
The availability of different restaurants to eat is excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Very much standard practice in hotels and should not detract from hotel rating : [u'location', u'sea']
Not cheap and you need transport to go anywhere but good rooms, great pools and on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Also hairdryer was not the best : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff are wonderful, resort beautiful and great breakfasts : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
service is quick & efficient : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Hard getting up in night because have to stumble around in the dark to get to the central switch to turn on lighting, only problem if you do that the whole room lights up like a christmas tree which wakes other sleeping people! This was difficult! I opened fridge door to give some light to the bathroom : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Would have been better off in Penang or Lankawi : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We have just returned from 10 days,all the facilities were great,the staff were just fantastic,from management down : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had the Luxury Escapes Package and thought it was very good value : []
But they want to make sure their guests feel comfortable, so they offered me a room upgrade to the premium room : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Most importantly the breakfast buffet was awesome the CREPES were to die for! Dinner at the Raja hotel was also awesome the DUCK is a must try!!! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
You just pick up a lush towel poolside and find a chair from which to begin ordering drinks and snacks : [u'amenities', u'conference']
These are minor downfalls as we will definitely be back; loved it! : []
Over priced New Years Eve Gala Dinner $250 plus and no drinks included : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
Of all of the superlatives, what sets it apart is the quality of the service : []
Room as far as possible from pool and beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
worth the extra $$$ to be treated like royality!!! : []
Free upgrade to a Palace Club Suite was awesome, but the Palace Club Lounge a tad dissapointing, ordering free cockatils during the 2-hour window is excruciatingly slow, almost as if on purpose, then they "run out" of Jack Daniels!? Shelves stocked up again when free time is up though! Breakfast food hygiene, hmmm, some things need to be kept on ice, or not re-used the next day : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Our second stay here certainly didn't disappoint and we plan to return again : []
Big resort and from our room at the top floor was 10 minutes walk to reach the pool and the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Palace Club is truly a resort within a resort : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Can't wait to get back : []
Gardens were amazing and so well kept : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The service we received and the wonderful ambience and attention your hotel showed us during our stay was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The 3 pm checkout was very beneficial when we were leaving at 9pm : []
You could sit inside or outside : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Awesome and delicious breakfast buffet too! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you have kids, it is perfect, they are safe, in clean surrounds and will find things to do : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
I enjoyed an excellent night's sleep in the extremely comfortable bed : []
We loved the spa pool : []
Also there is a great walking path along the front of the beach and was not crowded like Kuta Beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The rooms are serviced twice daily and we were never lacking or wanting for anything (Thank you for the complimentary water daily) : []
We honeymooned in the Nusa Dua : []
We had booked a deluxe room and were very happy with it! We loved this place and can't wait to go back (one day : []
The hotel was excellent, the room was very nice, and the bed quite accomodate the three of us : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
Very friendly and efficient staff, who would not enjoy the wonderful facilities and food in such a relaxing environment : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Lovely Balinese style rooms , with lots timber carving ,comfortable bed and well maintained bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Staff very polite and attentive, several restaurants and a buffet breakfast included, and theme nights also : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Just as I remembered it : []
Our family had illness and we were tended to by the hotel clinic as well as receiving flowers and fruit from management which was very thoughtful : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Nusa Dua is the place if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A large bathroom with a bathtub that could double as a shower and a separate shower cubicle : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the hotel's beach is dirty and u cant swim there in case of low tide,in morning it's around one and half meter high,but full of algae,in afternoon water runs so far away,till reef : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We were there for the Commonwealth Tennis Exhibition held in Westin, which is right next door of Nusa Dua Beach Beach Hotel : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We asked to be moved to another room and they did that without any hesitation : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Babysitting was excellent at $4/hour, very reliable and trustworthy : []
The resort is right on the beach, but there are also many facilities and activities to participate in if the beach isn't really your thing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The facilities and grounds were excellent, being centrally located at a development for high end hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Pools great with activities for children : [u'overall', u'culture']
This is a clean, hospitable hotel with friendly, accomodating staff and quality food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We went for the second time to Nusa Dua Beach hotel & Spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
My wife and I stayed 10 nights during April 2012 : [u'overall', u'culture']
Lastly the beach in front of NDBH is a great spot to watch the sunrise, breathtaking : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Check in was again great : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Tip: Ask for blue bird taxis when out and about as they are metered and very reasonable : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Please insist on BlueBird taxis, when ordering a taxi : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Great open-air common areas, nice room for the money and good overall facilities : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This was the first big hotel built in Nusa Dua and has spacious beautifully landscaped grounds, setting it aside from many of the more modern establishments : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Whilst not the most contemporary or trendy resort in Nusa Dua, this hotel more than makes up for it with its lush gardens, beautiful pools, proximity to the beach and friendly helpful staff : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Fresh local fruits, pastries, omelets cooked to your specs, open dining area : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
A little bit of Paradise : [u'location', u'sea']
It contributed to a very unhappy holiday : []
On Tuesdays they have a buffer dinner with a traditional dance show which is fantastic : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Reservation staff provided our request on room preference which closer to swimming pool : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
150IDR to Kuta, 4-500IDR for day tours ie a full 8hrs : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
From the moment we walked through the door however, we may as well have been paying a million dollars a night : []
Everywhere in Bali, you will get locals trying to sell you things : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
See next time : [u'location', u'sea']
Wish to be there once again : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Spacious grounds and plenty of beach frontage gives the feel of a much more intimate hotel : [u'overall', u'safety']
We picked four 5x7 pictures for free : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Take advantage of the wonderful breakfast every morning: omelette bar, pancakes, waffles, baked goods, bacon & sausage, fresh tropical fruits, cold cereal, toast, coffee, tea, breakfast potatoes : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
They couldn't do enough for us : []
Perhaps it was because we had stayed at smaller hotels with a more personalised service and this was a larger hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In short: if you're willing to spend that much and are the stay-in-hotel kind of people, the hotel is just awesome : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They were also selling sarongs (I paid $8), jewelery and boat tours : []
To sum up this is a perfect Hotel for family vacation (and for pampering yourself) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms are a little dated but in excellent and clean condition : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Staff very friendly, and food and facilities excellent : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
During my stay in Bali, I spent 5 nights at Nusa Dua and several nights at other hotels in Bali : []
The spa is totally worth it, specially the sauna and jacuzzi deserves at least an hour everyday :) the keckak dance with lobster dinner is also a most!! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
If anyone would like any of the multiple photos or videos I have taken, feel free to get in contact : []
Room was tidy and clean, bed is comfortable, just that the furnishing is quite old and no bathtub available for standard room, too bad for my boy who loves to use bathtub while bathing : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We had a great time with our 2 young kids : [u'overall', u'culture']
Would definitely come back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Several restaurants serving Balinese, Western and Asian foods : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

Very nice hotel with great location : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
close enough to enjoy Sanur and Benoa water sports : [u'amenities', u'gym']
just walk away : [u'amenities', u'patio']
From the moment we stepped out of the hotel transfer it was like we'd arrived home : []
Great for sports (running, biking, tennis and water sports) : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We enjoyed a wonderful holiday at a magnificent resort ,we didn't venture out of the resort because it had everything we needed ,top restaurants : []
There were some positives at the hotel and that was breakfast and he friendliness of the staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They considered this an upgrade : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I couldnt have wished for a nicer place to stay, our 15 Month old broke out in a rash which we took him to hospital to get checked : []
You can also shop here for souvenirs and also buy drinks etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is OK, and it is standard in tourist traps : []
Beautiful location, fully appointed, quintessential Bali and the spa is off the hook : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
At the end of our 4 week holiday in Bali, we stayed in the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 4 nights : []
They have free squash and tennis courts, pool table, PS3 etc : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We have spent 3 weeks in this hotel and we are surelly coming back! : []
All inclusive package is great value however per night price is a little pricey : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There is a well lit pathway, if you turn left you will come accross a little restuarant and bar called Kendi Kuning, it's about 10 -15 minutes walk, but you can get a cab, the food there is excellent and really good value, the drinks too are much cheaper than the hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
any of the other hotels in Nusa Dua strip where the beach access is cramped and the pool not so expansive : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
First room given felt abit damp - not been used for a while : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We could all stay in the same suite with independent bedrooms, and a private pool!! : []
The driver who took us back to the airport asked us if we were happy with our holiday, thanked us for staying at NDBH - and said he hoped to see us again soon : []
Pure magic : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The shower was also broken and supposedly fixed but never done : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
The pools and other recreational facilities were all first class : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']

Breakfast is pretty nice, with a wide selection that should go well with most people : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed here for 9 days, & had a great time : []
We stayed at the resort in April with our 20 month old son : []
(which was good if earlier) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We cannot recommend this hotel enough : []
What a relaxing stay we had at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa! We booked with Luxury Escapes and received an amazing package including theme dinners, spa treatments, and many other perks : []
Is the beach clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We had a great 10 day holiday : []
Breakfast is great and tasty : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
- the spa is nice and good balinese quality, with lots of traditional massages : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
We had the family room as we had 2 kids with us : []
The living area has a bunk bed : [u'location', u'general']
Special mention must be made to Supadmi and Suniah who were outstanding, the other staff were also attentive and professional in all aspects : [u'amenities', u'patio']
A mate booked this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It has great Balinese feel : []
The breakfasts were excellent in the Palace club room and the staff were all friendly and attentive, remembering our orders and tastes : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
so no need to go into the back streets for variety : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food was very ordinary and completely lacking in spice! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The location and landscaping all add to creating the perfect holiday ambience : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Stressful arrival : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel has classic appeal which distinguishes itself from neighbouring hotels which are very modern western looking : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It has sleepy and tired atmosphere, not romantic and jolly : []
Stayed here for business and really enjoyed the tranquility of this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This was the only minor quibble in a beautiful holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But, wifi was bad, very slow : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Nice and large beach was the highlight of the resort : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Starting with buffet breakfast, there is a nice range to choose from without being overwhelming, I particularly love the omlettes made to order and crepes : []
It has two outdoor swimming pools and plenty of exclusive areas for group entertainment : []
Our family enjoyed the facilities provided and excellent service, please improved quality restaurants that serve local food and the provision of special discounts for those who never enjoyed the hotel Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Most enjoyable retreat holiday with wife : [u'overall', u'culture']
All in all, I felt like I was in paradise, it's the best holiday I have ever had and will be going back without a doubt : []
Lovely garden with pond, complete with ducks, squirrels and goldfish which our daughter loved immensely : [u'overall', u'culture']
The service is amazing anything you asked for you got : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff are extremely helpful and courteous : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
They have entertainment almost every night and the food is high quality and delicious : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
It went way beyond our expectations and we felt very privileged to be there : []
you have made our stay in Bali the best ever : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you can afford it, the club offers some handy benefits (cocktails and afternoon tea), but depends on how much time you spend at the hotel, compared with shopping or on the beach (we spent lots of time in the hotel by the pool) : []
Overall still recommended for the value we paid : []
Overall, I was impressed with the property, the standard of food overall and the smiling, professional staff : []
Spa facility was nice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
You easily pay 3 euros for a simple coke, excluding the infamous '20% service charge and government tax' : []
I would thoughly recommend this resort, its great value for money, no hawkers to bother you, and the best service I've ever had : []
I'm used to Kuta prices so it was a bit of a shock, but I soon discovered that the rest of Nusa Dua is the same : [u'amenities', u'patio']
- the beach os good for kids as well, as it has not that much waves (which I did not like personally because of the sea grass) : []
Will be going back again for sure : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stuff is really great! Hotel is good for children : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beach chairs were ready on early morning just before sunrise and beach always kept clean by hotel : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
- The Hotel architecture is outstanding : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
it is situated in a peaceful area with lush green surroundings : []
The room was so cold even with having the A/C off! nobody could fix this problem! : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The beds are bolted to the floor and the mattress is placed on a plank of wood not very comfortable and very noisy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The ambiance of the resort architecture is just so very Bali, not global corporate style of the now many neighbouring properties that you may find in any location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I had my birthday out there and staff made it real special : []
Full of acitivies for the children : [u'overall', u'culture']
Congratulations to staff management for their honest attempts to meet our needs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

What to look for in Nusa Dua, besides sunrise and tranquility : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only negative comment we have is that food and drinks were very expensive - but then it is a 5* hotel so this is to be expected : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We like the property because it is built in the traditional Balinese style and decorated accordingly : []
I have stayed for 4 days in this hotel : []
overall a very happy stay and the strong ratings they get on tripadvisor are well justified : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As it was my 50th birthday we thought it would be nice to finish with a little bit of luxury and this certainly fit the bill : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I read countless reviews on Trip Advisor before deciding where to stay - Sheraton at Nusa Dua was my first choice, but it was fully booked, so after reading lots of good reviews of Nusa Dua hotel, I decided to book it : []
We have stayed in many 5 star hotels in Bali including the Conrad & Nusa Dua hotel is up there with the best of them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
One suggestion for the hotel management, please give free room upgrade like in Melia and Marriot, customers enjoy it and will come for more : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The beds are fresh and incredibly comfortable : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Its a very good hotel, very well located, with friendly and helpfull staff, the facilities are also well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The food was very good in all the restaurants, and everyone should go to Raja's and have the signature 'Duck' dish, it was beautiful and so soft it was carved with a spoon! : []
Staff very nice, service are personal : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
If you want to holiday at a resort where staff make you feel part of the family in tropical paradise settings : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The construction was annoying, because it was noisy and one had to take detours around the work, but that's understandable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort is not the newest on the strip but it does have the best location on the beach : []
At first I was a little disappointed that the hotel was in a 'hotel compound' so rather removed from the typical Bali scene (night markets etc) but the free shuttle bus provided by 'Bali Collection' (the local shopping centre) was excellent and we used it daily : []
otherwise it is great comfort, great value, the breakfast is excellent with good product quality and the staff is great ! : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
All of the Hotel restaurants have a very good menu and the qualtiy is although very good : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Safety is also addressed with guards and vehicle scrutiny at entry gates : [u'overall', u'safety']
They are so nice and amiable - you have no choice but to instantly like them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If I had known how much there was to do at, and around the hotel, I would have booked in for more than 4 days : []
The chairs on the beach are free with plenty of natural and artificial shade to hide under during the hottest times of the day : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The staff and management were friendly , accommodating and welcoming : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Really beautiful hotel, people, facilities and everything about this place! Would definitely recommend ! The only downside is that you can't really walk to the "cheap" markets : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We bought an Our Deal offer for 8 nights with inclusions and absolutely loved nothing at all to complain about it! I loved that I could sit at the chess bar and watch my kids swim in the pool and watch husband out surfing in the ocean! Staff were fab, my son tore his toenail off and the dr was called after hours to the I site clinic he was there within 20 minutes and a total of $67 for an injection and dressings! We were invited for a cocktail party which included drinks and food and it was absolutely lovely! Loved it and will def go back! : []
Wi fi should also be addressed as you could only access it in the club lounge ( not in your room) which is sometimes annoying : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Food was quite good, enjoyed the beachfront restaurant the most : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Rooms were the furthest away from the lifts which added extra time to go to and from the hotel rooms which was a bit of a pain, especially in the warm weather : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It wasn't totally perfect but being a 32 year old Resort I thought she has weathered well considering her age and being in the salt air there is bound to be wear and tear which is easy to overlook when there are so many other positives about the Resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The Theme nights on Monday,Wednesday & Firday nights are not to be missed as you are entertained with some balinese culture while you dine : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa was an excellent place to stay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There was almost anything you would want to eat, from north American cold cereals, to omelettes and bacon, to French pastries and traditional English baked goods, to Japanese, Chinese and Indonesian breakfasts, to tropical fruits of all sorts, to bangers and mash : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The meal on the friday night the seafood and satay BBQ was average the food was not cooked and we had long lines waiting for our dinner : []
The lush gardens and pools add to the beauty of the hotel : [u'amenities', u'garden']
This time I invited two of my friends from the UK and Hong Kong for their first holiday in Bali : []
Quite big hotel on the beach with many different restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
This is our third visit to Bali and we have stayed at a number of resorts and destinations : []
Very clean and Food great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Service & staff fantastic! Nothing too much trouble & always a smile from staff around the resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This property is a tad old, but well kept and mostly clean : [u'room', u'furniture']
You are in trouble if you have an Apple product : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
rooms are pretty spacious with wonderful views of the waters : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Not a big fan of the overhead shower and trying to close the shower door was interesting as there is no inside handle : []
The only facility we didn't use was the laundry : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Lucky enough to see a turtle laying her eggs on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Defiantly give it a try, I am sure you will love it! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we made the booking for 02 Adult and 02 Kids but when the confirmation printed showing only one adult : [u'amenities', u'conference']
- With the new highway, the hotel is only 20 mins from the airport, very convenient indeed : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
For me, the biggest minus was the beach : []
The room we were given was also great, looking over the main pool and across to the beach and the service throughout the resort was amazing : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The pool was great but do not recommend swimming in the ocean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Food was a little expensive but I didn't mind as the sevice was impeccable and the staff just so friendly and you could eat anytime of the day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel itself was beautifully clean and well maintained and the service we got was just incredible : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
nusa dua is somewhat isolated so eating options are limited hence why we ate at hotel a lot : []
EVERYTHING about this hotel is PERFECT : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach hotel and spa for 5 nights as part of our honeymoon to Bali : []
I stayed at the resort with my husband and two young kids (4 and 3 years old) and had a wonderful time at the resort : []
Would certainly like to go back again but would stay longer to have some days just for staying in the hotel grounds : [u'overall', u'safety']
Somehow the staff found out it was my birthday and out of the blue I was presented a birthday cake, accompanied by a large group of employees to sing to me : []
In general the stay in Nusa Dua area is very confortable since you can take advantage of the long walk on the beach and have wonderful morning run on it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The many pools are well looked after and the access to your private beach is at your fingertips : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Local 3g better that Telstra : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Bottom line is it's an amazing resort if you want to unwind and be spoilt by the staff who are very eager to always please,and that sort of summed up my vacation : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Definitely that we are coming back :-) : []
I would recommend this hotel to anyone : []
We asked to see other rooms and the helpful and patient duty manager showed us every other room available (about 5 in all), but they all had the same problem - dark, musty, damp, old : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The epitomy of Nusa Dua as a tourist trap was however the Bali Collection - a walled complex of restaurants and shops, equipped with its own security guards, shuttle transport back and forth from the hotel and information desks : []
The friendlyness of the staff complete with their devotion to serving their guests made for a very enjoyable stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Been here twice and will again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Everybody so helpful and attentive and making me feel welcome and well taken care of : []
Premier room was $NZ284 per night, including extensive buffet breakfast : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The room itself was very basic, the TV was quite old and lacked a lot in options, you really end up watching a lot of Discovery and Animal Planet due to the lack of options : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Machardi and his new "apprentice" we called" smiley" - Smiley he trained in the restaurant and was fantastic then was promoted to the chess bar but worked with Machardi - he was very proud of his achievement and will go a long way in the years to come : [u'location', u'sea']
It would have been impossible to take the pictures we did with a crowd : []
The rooms where great and the water for the shower was always hot : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We glided & floated in the pools, and sipped cocktails and nibbled on Italian delights reading pool side with fast Wifi : []
The food was great, the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful and the amenities within the complex and room were faultless : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We walked over to the next door Westin and found that the hotel has better pool and better deck chairs etc : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Staff were also fantastic : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Also, room is very dimly lit which makes it difficult to iron clothes : []
The hotel had this extraordinary feel of peace and relaxation : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 4 nights mid May : []
So beautiful, we cant wait to return : []
Excellent service from the staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We thoroughly enjoyed our holiday at this hotel and hardly ever left the poolside which was just great : [u'amenities', u'conference']

The hotel restaurant's were excellent : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Dinner at the resort or venture outside the gates to a place like The Tavern when you're ready or if you care : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had an eight night stay through luxury escapes and really couldn't be happier : []

The staff are very very friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
When we woke up and had breakfast, the breakfast environment was enjoyable, however, when we finished, we went outside of the restaurant to the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Our pictures are on MESIalbum : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The food delicious and at breakfast it is a monumental array of food from all customers no matter where they lived what ever was desired was in front of you and each day you can taste food to see what it is and how it tastes seen so much food put out for mulitnational travellers : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Had booked a Luxury Escape package and was a bit dubious as to what we were letting ourselves in for : []
From the first moment we arrived we were impressed by the sight of our entrance : []
:) the bartenders are helpful in case u need any assistance :) : []
The hotel is about 35 yrs old and is well maintained, the rooms were spacious and appointed in Balinese styling, we upgraded to a premier room which overlooked a beautiful part of the grounds : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The room is nice and clean but nuthing so stunning : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The female doctor was quite thorough and although after clinic hours 8pm arrived not 10 minutes after the call out which was I was extremely grateful for : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Anyway, overall experience is good : [u'overall', u'feel']
- A bit high prices in the restaurants, if you compare with outside ones : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- The best banana smoothies! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food was different but thats to be expected : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Even though the hotel is situated a little far out, it's still walking distance to restaurants and the little shops, there's also a free shuttle every hour going to the shopping square : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
This was the first hotel built at Nusa Dua and is truly the most authentic hotel in the area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The weather was perfect & it was the first time in years that I completely forgot about work & home while on holiday : []
It was with sadness we said goodbye to this wonderful hotel - smiling and helpful staff, everything spotlessly clean, true Balinese decoration (oh my, the carving on handrails and the lights in the main foyer were truly amazing!!) and wonderful Balinese hospitality : []
There are five excellent choices to dine and the outlook from the beach is very romantic if that is what you are after : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was just nice and refreshing to be in a resort not full of Brits!! (went to maldives last year and was like a little butlins!! lol) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
One that was unique was a pool for kids that had a sloping side with sand : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The room was constantly air conditioned and very effective : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
They also have a kids club which we didn't try because we were happy to swim with the little ones : []
Minuses - breakfast is the same every day, a bit boring after few days : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Staff were superb : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Probably great if you have kids or just enjoy sunbathing, but it seems a waste to go all the way to Bali to stay somewhere like this : []
Spent a week in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa as part of a package deal : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I knew that Nusa Dua was a gated 5* complex and so I wasn't expecting to see much if the 'real' Bali but having stayed in kuta before I was happy with this : []
There was also some construction going on right between the pool and the beach which wasn't indicated at the time of booking : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The theme night dinners were amazing and the food was ridiculous ( in a good way) The staff I cannot fault ! they were nothing but beautiful, genuine and ever so friendly, we did not want for anything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Nusa Dua area is a tourist precinct that retains a lot of the true Balinese spirit - friendly helpful staff and a truly relaxing ambience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

hotel about 20 min walk to Bali Collections (shops and restaurants) or shuttle from hotel, or taxi (under $3aud) : []

We never went without water in our rooms : []
The same ladies are available to baby sit for a small fee at night : [u'overall', u'culture']
Rooms were 'tired' : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The beach is not wow, and its more like a bay, as the waves break really far away from the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
only fault was the buffet breakfast if one doesn't eat that much needs to be another price availability for smaller option for breakfast : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We have stayed in Bali 7 times now at differents locations and hotels each time : []
My wife and I had our honeymoon at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel 17 years ago : [u'overall', u'culture']

The only thing that I would suggest to upgrade is kids club its a bit dated and there wasnt much for my kids to do there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
even the restaurants quite nice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

A good guy!! To be greeted by courteous drivers with chilled water in hand was a nice touch to and from the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
From arrival to departure it was a truly positive experience and I cannot compliment the staff enough for their efforts : []
There are 4 pools, 2 specifically for kids and the lagoon pool with its sand beach is very nice but too many kids for me so we spent all our time in the large main pool : []
Highly Highly recommended : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
And not to forget the sandy beach, it was so comforting : []
Most of the local drivers are familiar with the hotel which is a bonus especially when arranging transport to and from spas, restaurants and other destinations : [u'amenities', u'conference']

Nusa Dua is a gated community of elite hotels & resorts & you are treated like royalty where ever you go : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Breakfast was ample but never varied for the nine days we were there : []
It is perfect for a romantic holiday, or if you just need to relax and be pampered : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

There are amazing water features and gardens and fit so well together and make this largish hotel feel small : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Food provided at Palace club was excellent and all the staff from Manager to waiters and waitress and very nice, friendly and helpful : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
This area is not really Bali : [u'location', u'general']
We both enjoyed it : []
Food in general is good but is limited in variety : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Currently, as it stands, the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa provided none of the services for which I had paid and I can only see this as a breach of terms of contract : []
They said it would be no problem though, and at 6am a feast of local fruits, cereals, breads and champagne was set on a table on the beach with a some fantastic displays of cerominal flowers and an arch way with our names on with 2 waiters to serve us : []
The food was great the atmosphere was so very relaxing : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
It's very cheap and you get a good helping of burger and wedges : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Amazing beach and beautiful and well cared tropical garden : [u'amenities', u'garden']
But it turns out to be an average experience : []
The people who work for this hotel are the best : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Rooms were large and good quality, the traveller photos are a fair representation : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Breakfast was very good and room was on the ground floor so in few steps and you are in beautiful garden with playful squirrels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach was nice to swim and relax on : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Great stay here, the staff are all excellent and cannot do enough for you, if I was to have a criticism it would be the dining experience, I feel the food could be improved upon, in the Grill restaurant my food was served cold and did not look fresh for one example : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
I had always dreamed we would have a champagne breakfast on the beach during our honeymoon, but this is not something they normally do : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
All in all we loved the place and would definitely return again : []
Great pools, bars, restaurants, friendly staff, and great location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Go to breakfast early if you want a table : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the room we had was satisfactory and clean : []
I finally stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : []
go to the Nusa Dua Becah Hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I also found it to be cheaper than most of the other hotels in Nusa Dua : []
5 stars located on Nusa Dua beach along a strip of adjoining hotels with a path along the beach connecting them together : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
for renting kayak, SUP or Windsurf Board (38USD/hr!) : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling']
A lot places of interest, some of them just unforgettable : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Pools: Again, extremely aged : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast is also super yummy and the Koi Carp fishes in the lobby are awesome : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Forget the age and the slightly date decor : [u'overall', u'culture']
I have been a regular visitor to this great hotel but will have to review my options for the future : []
The hotel meets our family priorities are: price, beach, room, pools, room-to-beach distance : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Other negatives was the works going on right next to the pool, that we had to call housekeeping on 5 occasions to replenish our coffee and tea after the room had been serviced, the drinks were expensive and lastly that there is no laundry facilities to do your own laundry, which is difficult with kids : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Our room was not very well cleaned : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
And therefore the prices are higher : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I really loved this resort : []
However they didn't their best to appease us by having a special dinner on beach with cake and singers for my daughters birthday which we appreciated but unfortunately we just did not enjoy our stay here and wouldn't come back : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Your bit of The beach isn't great (youre not allowed on any other hotels bit, see!) and i felt quite bad at the fact that there were teams of security guards in combat trousers with handguns walking around what what supposed to be a relaxing hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The staff, though friendly were dated : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This meant my teenage son could have his own bed and bathroom instead of having to share a king size bed with his sister, so we were all very happy with this : []
The hardest part of this resort is the cost of everything : [u'amenities', u'conference']
All was good at the 5 star Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
great pools, very family friendly, fantastic staff : [u'overall', u'culture']
One Comp photo per room is a good gesture from the hotel (keep in mind that camera that they use is Canon 500D only) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We normally like to eat out when travelling, but the kitchen was so excellent that after a couple days we found ourselves looking forward to dinners in the hotel : []
- complimentary water (2 bottles) get filled up every day, I had the impression even two times : []
Our 'double' bed was 2 single beds pushed together, which we promptly fell through during the night : []
The hotel has retained an authentic and laid-back Balinese feel eventhough the rooms have been modernised : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Still daydreaming about this place can't wait to go back : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I was skeptical to come here, as I wanted to spend more time in Ubud, but my travel agent wanted us to stay here as well to experience the best beach resort! Indeed it was a great beach destination : []
Bought more packages will definitely be returning : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you intend going to Kuta then walk out the gate and catch a Blue Bird taxi, insist on the meter : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We attended 3 buffets during our stay as part of the package so sawa good crossection on what was on offer : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You can take a taxi ride into Kuta (main shopping complex), short taxi ride of 40 mins or so : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Anyway have a great time you'll love it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we have been many times to your hotel and every time we love it more : []
A lovely beach with calm water, a range of pools, kids activities at certain times of the day : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
You don't feel that it's 30 years old! Room was comfy : []
It would be better If the breakfast has more selection : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I highly recommend this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Overall, the best thing about the resort are all the people running it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- staff is very friendly at all times - if there is a question or problem it will be easily fixed within 5 minutes : []
The breakfast is more intimate, the afternoon tea is a nice treat for the middle of the day and the cocktails in the early evening is so generous : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
The assistance provided to us by the hotel was, and still is, incredibly humbling : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Where to start in reviewing this amazing place? We got so much out of our stay at this beautiful hotel, we didnt want to leave and we can't wait to go back : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Best choices of restaurants with great delicacies and theme dinner : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Spa is high end and a luxurious treat : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
without forgetting the kindness of the staff around the pools, always happy to help : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Just returned from a stay at Nusa Dua Beach hotel, the hotel surroundings are fantastic and facilities great : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Left Bali with a healthy glow and at least an extra 2kgs : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We wondered if it was because they charge so much for drinks (cocktails are pretty much aust prices) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
They keep the touts away, traffic is limited and it's very secure and this adds to the serenity : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just spent 8 days on a luxury escapes offer with my husband & 16 yo daughter : [u'overall', u'culture']
Although not the cheapest place to stay in Bali the family experience on a whole was very positive : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We checked in at the Palace Club (same as the Club at the Conrad) : []
On one night the workers were at it till 2am! : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
You go through security checkpoints to get in : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A good gym and the spa was great : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Had a nice five nights stay in this hotel with family : [u'overall', u'culture']
It has 2 children's pools and a koi pond : []
The hotel should have planned for at least a week of rotatory menu, so that guests have always something to look forward to : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
but each restaurant calculated it to be worth different rupiah - at Chess Bar it was worth 10500 and the spa almost 12500? We tried to join in the 1hour kayaking activity and the man looking after it told us we needed to pay for the use of the kayaks : []
Pocket friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
We did this and about 8 : []
Amazing gardens, kind and very helpful help, and gorgeus breakfast at a really very good price-quality relation : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The beautiful Balinese style and tranquility was so relaxing! : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
spending a day only at the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
A most idyllic resort : [u'location', u'sea']
We stayed for 9 nights and had a lovely, relaxing hoilday : []
Stayed here for 5 nights over 2012 New Year period with my husband & 2 older teenage children : [u'overall', u'culture']
Also, a beach seafood meal is a must! Thank you so much! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The room was lovely and all the rooms overlook the pool out towards the ocean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Breakfast was included every day and the choice was incredible : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
It has Sogo (Department Store) and plenty of restaurants : []
Many times you have to follow up the drink requests : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very nice and confortable rooms, only down side is old furniture : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The staff were very attentive, polite and only too willing to help : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The beach was OK but most days the sea was too rough to swim in : [u'location', u'sea']
Thank you for the wonderful service you gave us at breakfast, lunch and dinner : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall great place!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The ground floor was more important to us as I have a knee issue : []
We had a great stay in this hotel, it is one of the few authentic hotels in balinese style, but completely renovated : []
This was theirst stop in our Indonesian honeymoon so my initial reaction was to be rather impressed : [u'overall', u'culture']
It really is such a shame that the excellent facilities are not showcased to their maximum potential : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I have felt very special to have stayed here for the past 9 days : []
The one disadvantage of staying in the Nusa Dua area is that, being a gated 'enclave', local dining options are limited to either your hotel, neighbouring hotels, or the Bali Collection mall : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Hotel grounds and gardens beautifully maintained , great pool bar and good snacks to be had with your drinks : [u'overall', u'safety']
The staff really made us feel comfortable : []
The hotel is quite old and need for an urgent refurbishment ( except this, rooms are very good,no matter what is your landscape-everywhere is a park!) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Night Markets were within walking distance and metered taxi's were very cheap : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pretty impressed with the restaurants too but we got free meals with our voucher - I wouldn't be too happy paying full price as it was much more expensive then Kuta restaurants : []
The pools and Spa were excellent, although the lack of sun lounges poolside needs to be addressed, with guests "reserving" them early by placing towels and bags there : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We had booked airport transfer and even though we were detained for 1 1/2 hrs at immigration as too many flights came in at once, the staff were passionately waiting for us with a sign : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had a relaxing break, food was good especially breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The hotel is the BEST place for relaxation : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If you are after a very comfortable, relaxing hotel, and are looking forward to spending the majority of your time chilling out rather than sightseeing, stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfasts, with the fish hunting heron and 4 foot lizard were a brilliant experience too : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
And the Buffet Style of serving was not a pleasant one as the food was luke warm most of the time : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
A great place for relaxation, honeymoons, weddings and all : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
it made this trip a truly memorable one and we will cherish the memories forever : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All explained several times but they only do as instrucred, no common sense is allowed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The service is excellent, location beautiful with Balinese decor and the leisure facilities great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Begins with a memorable sunrise not to be missed every morning just right at the beach or outside the SeaView rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Shower rose blocked : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
The hotel is more towards the Balinese architecture which is aesthetically pleasing : [u'amenities', u'conference']
just returned from 12 nights at the nusa dua beach hotel and spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
- more than one answer possible but not clickable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
All in all I loved this place and I guess it's true when they say 'you get what you pay for', because at $300 a night I would want to have a perfect stay :) : []
The Chess Bar restaurant on the beach had some issues with food quality and menu however the service was very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There were three males who were very good - their names escaped me over and over - a large/tall man who smiled all of the time and was always happy to please : [u'amenities', u'patio']
about 10 minutes from the hotel but not as much shade if you go in the day) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
it is a very quiet and serene area and we didn't think it was fair to the other guests to have our two little boys running around! : []
Excellent value for a beach side resort in this area : [u'location', u'general']
NDBH is older than nearby hotels but it has tradition, charm and sweet Bali smells! While we were there, some rooms were being renovated - but you never heard a sound : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The aircon works perfectly : []
Overall, despite the niggles mentioned, we were delighted with the hotel : []
It is a beautiful resort and staff are a credit but may be time to compare it to something else : []
Our welcome evening of cocktails was a great way to meet fellow guests : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
There is a few restaurants and we got an enjoyable dinner at the one on the beach a few times but it was pretty espensive (12AUD for a main) compared to prices in Sanur and Ubud (3-6AUD for a main) Overall a nice expirience but probably would stay 3 or even 2 nights instead of 4 as its wonderful for relaxing but not for much else : []
I loved everything about this hotel : []
Love the lobby surround wt gold fish pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Loved the place, the pool and beach are side by side and are both amazing : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
On the downside, the pool area is showing its age - which is about 40 years iirc : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The evening entertainment is limited, but most people probably are not looking for that anyway : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They had everything you could want hot or cold food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is as lovely as other establishments in the same area with beautiful gardens, tidy beach, lovely pools and great ambiance : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Of course, this is "resort" Bali so take some trips outside this very nice enclave too : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
I am going back before the end of the year and would highly commend the Hotel to anyone who likes to be right on the beach : [u'amenities', u'patio']
This was our second stay at the hotel having spent 9 days there a year ago and it remains a very special place : []
The entire resort is also on the beach front with plenty of deck chairs around (including around the pools) that meant that no one area was ever really busy : [u'location', u'general']
Highly recommended to anyone needing complete stress free holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Go in to Bali Collection shopping centre (a 15 min walk or free shuttle bus from resort) to eat : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Will miss them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Even though only 1 night I enjoyed it : []
room condition is soso : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
The restaurant area by the beach is truly lovely and a walk along the path at the beach at night is sure to stir up some romance : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We would love to go back : []
The staff are very obviously well trained and extremely polite to guests : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The grounds are very nicely kept and as it is an older property the garden and trees are mature : [u'amenities', u'garden']
This is a lovely 4 star hotel, we arrived with 3 families, no rooms were ready at 1pm so we thought we would come back at 2 : []
It includes an upgrade to Premier room, three dinners for two at the Balinese banquets, free cocktails, three spa treatments per person at the beautiful spa and free breakfasts every morning : []
I stayed in Augist with my wife and our 3 children : []
The Gardens and Balinese style certainly gives the wow factor, the staff are very helpful and nice, one half of the hotel was under enovation but this was hardly noticed at all, the pool and beach were perfect : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The hotel is connected to all the other resorts in the Nusa Dua, and in the evenings, its a very nice walk where you can see all these resorts nicely lit up : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We stayed during the busy peak season, and not to my surprise our room was not ready on check-in, we were offered 2 free drinks in the lobby bar and a few snacks to chew on while we waited : []
Staff were friendly and welcoming, room was comfortable and food was excellent - thank you : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
My friends definitely enjoy the experience and trust me, staying at a beautiful resort such as the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel definitely gives your Bali experience a good boost : []
Lovely kind staff and wonderful service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The landscape is fully grown in, and while not brand new, all hotel amenities and rooms are in good working order : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The landscaping is fabulous with paths leading to the main hotel and to the beautiful beach : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Hotel was quiet and kids club was often empty but could be improved to be more welcoming for 5-6 years old (toys more aimed at babies) : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
(was there for two weeks) Normally there is something that always spoils your holiday but this was faultless, great food , great prices, hotel was spotless, (seems they just love to clean) room was attended to at least twice a day and never anywhere ive been have i met such friendly staff, everyone was so kind and helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We did have to show our booking papers to get all of our special deals, most of our main meals were also included this was terrific, certainly worth paying extra for the privledge's : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
No matter what you asked them for, nothing was too much bother : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beautiful setting and location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bali is the best place to relax : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Great R&R location and far from the madding crowd, The adjacent beach strip both North and South continually improves with more peer group establishments : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Bean') appears to me to consider his hotel perfect and any suggestion on improvement to be the thoughts of heathens : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Wow if you are looking for paradise in Bali look no further a different experience to Kuta resorts much quieter area in general but plenty for us to do kids love the kids club the traditional dress photos of the kids are priceless : [u'amenities', u'internet']
And it took us almost 30 mins to take a cab back to the hotel : []
Also no TV on kids room in family room although essentially paying for 2 rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Very friendly staff that made you feel very welcome : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For us, it had everything we needed - a family resort with enough facilities to keep us happy for 7 days (we weren't keen on travelling out and about too much on this particular trip), kids club that catered more to younger kids (our kids are 5 and 3 : [u'overall', u'culture']
If you walk to the beach you can get cheap massages or use the day spa if you want that spa treatment, staff there were just lovely! You will need to get a good lounge by the pool early as these get taken quickly and most stay around there all day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also, if this is the type of accommodation agreed by the likes of Agoda, then neither shall I use them again : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel has good facilities for children including a playground, kiddies pool, babysitting service and Gekkos Kids Club (free for hotel guests) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We went on a couple of trips out, and the hotel will kindly book a taxi for you and you pay the hotel direct, which saves haggling, but you will pay over the odds for this, but these were small people carriers as opposed to minicabs : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Every morning you can feel the wonders of nature right at your balcony enjoying a cup of hot coffee and watching every type of birds or squirrels right there at your footstep : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Relaxing atmosphere : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
Expect to bargain on all prices and expect rudeness : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
basically this is an old property with the rooms size as very small : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I suppose if you just want your kids to have a swim in the pool and to get some sun, then it's OK, but a Balinese experience it ain't, and as Western experiences go it was unpleasant : []
It wouldn't be that bad if the hotel was rated 3 stars instead of 5 : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I had seen a few, let's say average, reviews regarding the resort, so you can say I was somewhat 'open mided' about what my wife and I were in for, what made us book was basically an online deal that seemed to good to pass up : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Once we arrived we also requested a cot which was provided free of charge : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I recommend the spa for the ecstatic feeling of liquid butter after any of their spa programs :) : []
Absolutely loved this place, location, rooms, friendliness and efficiency of staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We loved it : []
What a wonderful place Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa was Our stay was so relaxing and enjoyable : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The staff could not do enough for us and made our stay really special : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is among the very best of holiday hotels I ever had the pleasure of staying in : []
I know for a fact that anyone that disagrees has not been to any other country in their entire life : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staffs are very friendly and make me feel warm and welcome : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The ammentities were a bit of a let down being cheap generic shampoo and condtioner etc : []
My husband had a birthday during our stay and we were surprised by a delicious birthday cake : []
You will need to book - it is worth it! They will drop you back at the hotel for free! Also 'Tropical' on Mengiat Street was nice : []
The driveway and entrance are impressive - the Balinese stone gates, lush with greenery, hint at what is to follow, and the spacious reception area with its raised fish ponds, immediately evokes a sense of calm and tranquillity : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
( you can get cheap massarges on the beach but never tried ) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is the main reason for not allocating a full 5 stars : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The massage treatments were very good : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
The NDBH looks dry hot and concretey at the entrance, but once you step past the lobby, the tranquility and charm begins : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stunning location and was great to chill out by the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Food at the hotel wasnt too great and quite expensive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had issues re Passport in Australia and had to move original dates which the staff were very understanding and accommodating : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The daily breakfast was good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The GM's namesake might have been a brilliant abstract painter, but there is nothing abstract about his management of his hotel - perfect bliss, try it for yourself : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Highly recommend this hotel and would Love to return anytime : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As with our previous stays, we decided to select the Palace Club option and did not regret it as the service and exclusive club area is really worth it : []
I ordered Mie Goreng and it was purely unpalatable : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I would definitely go back again : []
The main problem is the beach cleaning : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The actual area could do with an upgrade for example better outside activites i : [u'location', u'general']
The rooms were clean and comfortable, but on the smaller side compared to the other Bali hotel I stayed at in Ubud, but the room staff was attentive to every detail : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We are both in our 60's and have been coming to Bali on and off since the mid 1980's : []
Nusa Dua is a great place to stay in Bali away from the ugliness of Kuta : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Staff amazing, nothing too much trouble : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Lots of restaurants in Nusa Dua offer free transport back to the hotel which was great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel staff were very accommodating and helpful and changed our rooms very quickly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We spent the second week of our Xmas break here, sadly this hotel is now very tired and dated and showing it : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Pizza from the restaurant was very average : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I felt like I was staying in an amusement park : []
At the first we came along here actually we are not booked for a suite room : []
anyway I must leave to catch my plane so be it : []
The walk along the path (beachfront) which passed various other luxury hotels was lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The buffet nights are ok but if you don't eat seafood then there isn't a lot of choice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
pool view and beach view with a well connected kids room (see tip) : [u'amenities', u'gym']
the palace club service was very disappointing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our room service took over an hour to come then was cold and then changed us with a room delivery service fee even though it was a voucher : []
With the palace club upgrade : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
00 USD for a Diet Coke at the lobby store is a bit high : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Yes its spotless with clear water that is safe to swim in : [u'amenities', u'pool']
My 1st time stay here in Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
There was a wonderful fireworks display to see in the new year : [u'location', u'sea']
Annoying numbered men and women attempting to sell some junk for exorbitant prices (you have to haggle apparentely, but if you want to go shopping : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
At last we took a journey to the other side of Bali at beautiful Jimbaran Bay : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
My son had booked the break and when we checked-in there was some confusion, they couldn't quite sort out that there were two men with the same surname but it was quickly resolved : []
A few things I could pick on: : []
We stayed in a Palace Club Suite for 10 nights and enjoyed our time at the hotel : []
This is our fourth trip to Bali and the first time staying at Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall the food was good including palace cub : [u'location', u'forest']
The hotel facilities were excellent, we used the gym which was well equipped and very well air conditioned! The whole spa area is a peaceful haven away from the rest of the hotel and I reccomend the loungers around the lap pool for a lovely quiet spot to read a book : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Good value and very entertaining : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, the drain in the shower kept overflowing into the toliet area of the bathroom and after asking to have it cleared twice it had not been fixed : []
Certainly I come back to this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Suite was enormous and breakfasts in thye Palace club was fantastic, as were the cocktails in the afternoon : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Only downside is that you need to travel a bit for shopping : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Quiet, relaxing, fairly private : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
i did lots of research and finally chose this hotel and it was the best decision : []
The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and service was good although service at pool area was a bit slow and could have done with a few more staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The table tennis and snooker table was much appreciated by everyone in our company : [u'amenities', u'gym']
even the wine is in line with the food : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The ;pool and pool area had nothing that was above an average hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nice escape from the madness of the conference hotel, yet only max 10 minute walk : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If you want to, they have a recreational room with a lot of options : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Our holiday was all that we could wish, Very helpful staff who went out of their way to accommodate our needs : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I just want to share about our travel experience in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : []
great swimming pool and and beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is very well run, staff are so efficient and amazingly enough nothing is too much trouble : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All staff are friendly and helpful, rooms have everything we need and are clean : []
The kids club was fantastic and nothing was too hard : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The Hotel has a 5 star Spa with 5 star service and 5 star prices : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
U can walk to Westin and use their restaurant : []
Relaxing environment, staff are very quick to help with any request : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Our air conditioners worked beautifully : [u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
Thank you for a memorable holiday and making it special in every way : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The swimming pool was great but you have to be quick, people get down to the pool very early and 'book' loungers using towels, and then hardly turn up during the day : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
I thanked him and then I said I had forgotten to ask for drinking straws for the kids, but don't worry, just bring it with the food later : []
We used our Cudo purchased voucher when staying here and it was well worth it : []
* great path along the beach that make the 30 minutes walk to Bali Collection a real pleasure : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The staff were all very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The room had a damp smell to it and after having a shower a sewerage smell seemed to arise from a vent somewhere in the bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Our wedding co-ordinator Metalia looked after us from start to finish, and everything went off without a hitch! We combined our wedding and honeymoon (2 weeks), and once again enjoyed all the facilities of the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The gardens are lovely and offer privacy from the balcony (just don't lean on the rail) : [u'amenities', u'garden']
My sister and I had one off the best holidays spent here for sure : [u'overall', u'culture']
This place is perfect for families with children : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Would have given 5 out of 5 if not for this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The cocktail evenings and breakfast service were fantastic and made the holiday really relaxing : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
You won't need to eat until dinner, and will probably find yourself lingering a long time because of the ambience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I was really touched by this - so so thoughtful : []
But the food is delicious and is always well prepared : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Our time at Nusa Dua Beach Resort provided a great start to our 2 week Bali holiday : [u'location', u'sea']
Only disappointment is the Spa : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The rooms were also small for Bali : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
You then end up waiting many minutes for them to bring it out from the galley : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We're also looking at renewing our wedding vowes in the next couple of years : []
There are a group of similar hotels on the same beach (all interconnected) : [u'amenities', u'conference', u'recreation']
Kids meals very limited with only a handful of meals which they can only pick from for dinner and lunch and do not have great nutritional value : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This is a resort set on a huge area with gardens and monuments dotting the landscape : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nonetheless, take your documentation and enjoy the stay safe in the knowledge you have proof of arrangements : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nice and clean premises : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
The room was big, clean, very comfortable but similar to many hotel rooms we had stayed in : []
Just great to be in one place and do all the activities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Great choise to spend a week few years ago : [u'location', u'sea']
Lovely quiet hotel on the peninsula of Nusa Dua , ideally positioned right on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Great way to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
If you arrive at night it looks very impressive & it is only by day that you can see just how shabby it is : []
Drink service at the chess bar was incredibly slow waiting for drinks to arrive : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The food & drink costs are higher than other areas of Bali but the privacy & service & peace is more than worth the extra : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Free wifi on the lobby area and lobby bar, though : [u'location', u'general']
We had an amazing time at the resort, we explored a lot of Bali, but on some days couldn't wait to get back to the resort to relax : [u'amenities', u'pool']
They had a parque flooring which reminded me of home : [u'amenities', u'conference']
However at the end of the holiday the check out process turned out pretty sour : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Management and Staff where very help full and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The buffets at the 3 theme nights was enjoyable and plentiful : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The happy hour 2 for 1 drinks at the Chess Bar are a good deal : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
After explaining our situation yet again we were then apparently given a room upgrade and by around 10am the room transfer had taken place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The first night we stayed in a standard room for 3, nice room for a couple, not suitable for 3 though as the kids bed was next to ours : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
Varnish on wood in room is chipped and worn : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
My partner and I loved our stay here : [u'overall', u'culture']
we were invited to a VIP cocktail evening in one of the suits : []
looking forward to visit soon : [u'amenities', u'patio']
If you do not want to eat in the resort, you can catch a taxi 5 mins away is the Bali Connection : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup', u'post-room', u'checkout']
A good idea if u want to ease into the indonesian experience but know that u're an expensive cab ride from most activities : []
Small hair dryer : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Overall, this hotel was quite pleasant and i think it's the most value hotel in Nusa Dua Area : []
We also like being able to walk outside the hotel and look in markets and watch the footy in a bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The room and location itself was perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I stayed here for 7 nights with my family (4 adults) in February and found the hotel the perfect place to unwind in the sun! The staff are all super friendly and helpful and the hotel backs onto a fantastic stretch of beach : []
I left Singapore trying to escape the noise and was not happy to find a building site next door : []
Large resort, maybe a little too large as it had a feel of a European all inclusive with out the free beer and ice creams : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The gardens and sculptures are beautiful, and your first impression of the lobby is beautiful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I also looked at the Melia hotel, which is about 3 hotels down on the same beach strip but was glad we didn't stay there - it had more of a big hotel vibe - loud music, large tour groups, pushy staff and watered down cocktails (we went there for happy hour one day) : []
I would stay here again, happily : []
The sandy beach was good, constantly being cleaned, and there were only a few licensed hawkers who were not pushy at all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Also in the peek time not enough cheers are available : [u'location', u'sea']
We would certainly come back : []
We discussed ours and by doing that the staff had the opportunity to deal with it : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Sandros was consistently good : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
so u don't need extra long walk to reach to the lobby, pool, or to the beach : []
* A wing of the hotel and a swimming pool in renovation : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
If you use the free transport (both ways), you can stock up on drinks & snacks very cheaply either before or after dinner : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We Liked Most the chess Bar with having Dinner and Cocktails in the Beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
They will take you not too far into the sea where you can spots lots of fishes : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food is expensive in Nusa Dua generally, (example, hot dog or hamburger only at the resort circa $8 AUD) but there is a great little beach side bar and cafe called the Pirate Bar about a ten to 15 minute walk (turn right) along the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant']
We booked the family room, it can accomodate 2 adult, two young boys in a huge bunk bed and also a toddler : []
service standard wasn't awesome : [u'overall', u'safety']
The hotel is located right on the beach with some lovely restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed 8 nights and had the best holiday : []
The Westin which is next door to Nusa Dua Hotel, seems nice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
All sport courts and facilities are required to pay but the price is reasonable : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Was tough to decide between Nusa Dua and Sanur which are both quite different so we chose both with 4 nights here and 2 nights in Sanur (not worth mentioning which hotel) and wished we had longer at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
We checked out and headed back to KP where we had a huge suite overlooking the pool with great restaurants/massages/shopping at our fingertips, for the same price as NDBH! : []
Its a big beach property : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Comfortable room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, if you are a family with children looking for some holiday time, this hotel also cater to your family needs : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Friendly staff and clean and modern rooms combined with an excellent location : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Free juice or coffee on the beach at sunrise : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
and of course Bali Collection (which we actually really enjoyed - inflated prices but still cheaper than home and surprisingly diverse) : []
Shower was fantastic : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
We are happy with the outing but won't do it again, there are better places within Nusa Dua and cheaper : [u'location', u'general']
I went to this hotel over 10 years ago : []
The choice was wide enough, prices almost equal, so the winner was the hotel offering an ocean view room as it claims : []
Nothing negative to say whatsoever : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
the gardens are imaculate and very well tended to : [u'amenities', u'garden']
But u're in a tourist enclave and have no contact with the local culture beyond the hotel staff : []
Overall a wonderful stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Meal choices to suit every culture and cuisine - awesome start to the day : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I will definitely stay here again and not even look for another place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Beach and pool areas were clean and relaxing with all the facilities of a top resort : [u'location', u'general']
Issues include mouldy odour, worn and aged interior furniture, poorly maintained exterior balconies with stained and badly weathered furniture : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
The bed was firm, and I usually like a soft bed, yet I slept amazingly well : []
The are 2 pools to choose from and one in particular suits the children perfectly : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Wait staff slow to replenish drinks and unsure about gluten in food : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
we loved watching them around the resort : []
This time we were so lucky to experienced the turtle hatched on the beach behind the hotel at night : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The mini bar is outrageous but you can catch a cab to Bali Collection shopping centre (5 mins) where you can buy cheap drinks at the supermarket, there's also a lady on the beach that sells from a modest stall (turn left on the beach) Food in Nusa Dua is expensive but you can always find cheaper fare at Bali Collection Shopping Centre but it's a bit like dining in Surfers Paradise so it's worth paying extra to eat along the beach : []
We understood that some of the staff members have been in the hotel since it was opened 31 years ago : []
The wooden,carved furnishings and decorations exuded a traditional Balinese style : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I believe they haven't finished renovating the rooms, so remember to ask for the new one when you check in : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Palace Club is excellent value for money : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
It was absolutely perfect for what we wanted : []
The masseurs were lovely girls, and the whole experience of being outdoors, listening to the ocean and the palm trees in the breeze was fabulous : [u'overall', u'feel']
Overall, wonderful holiday, would definitely stay again (in fact already looking for deals!) : [u'location', u'sea']
The bed and pillows were comfortable, though : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
Beautiful and prestine with a lot of Balinese culture infused, clean and comfortable with many picture worthy spots : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just beautiful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is how i define a fine Bali hotel : []
The breakfast, drinks, afternoon tea and cocktails are great : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
As with anywhere in Nusa Dua, the ready availability of everything you need means you may start to get cabin fever after a few days, however taxis are waiting right outside the hotel doors, and day trips to Uluwatu, Ubud etc help break this cycle : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'others']
Bath robs and towels were not replaced daily and were just folded and kept back in place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We took full advantage of the free spa treatments and they were brilliant : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The staff are happy and helpful, just painfully slow : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
and a very nice admosfear we feld verry welcome : []
It was worth paying the extra, because you get a more personalised experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The facilities are good and the landscaping is charming : [u'amenities', u'garden']
I think it would be a wonderful place to have a commitment ceremony or a renewal of vows : []
there is also a kids club but it was mainly empty so no insentive to sent our child there : []
We recently stayed at this icon of the Nusa Dua area having first been there in 1984 : []
The hotel breakfast meats are pork free : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Staff was very friendly not waiting for the tips as elsewhere ; positive point : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This smell continued throughout our stay : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
We both would definitely stay here again! : []
Staff are very friendly and are doing everything to make the guests happy : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Staff were always friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It has a beautiful landscape, compared with other hotels in Bali that i've stayed : []
The second pool is PERFECT for the whole family to enjoy, specially if you have small kids : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
To begin with, staff of this hotel is polite but it mainly reflects on the Balinese people because they are all extremely nice and warm hearted people, and this is where the good part ends : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Not worth the $ you spend for at the end : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast is sumptuous and there are shows inside the hotel premises you can enjoy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But definitely nothing to complain about : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Buy great far east fruits and Balinese coffee : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
And the grounds of the hotel are simply amazing, with fabulous Balinese temples, ornamental lily ponds and brilliant planting throughout : [u'overall', u'safety']
What we got was a tiny sliver of a view of the ocean : []
We stayed in a Palace Suite which was very roomy and had very good facilities : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We have stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa twice now and will continue to go back : []
I was also upset at having the most expensive meal of my whole trip here (at the Italian place by the pool, apparently the cheapest option) where: the food was beyond disgusting (and I'm not a picky person); service was appalling; they got our drinks wrong twice; service was very slow; they forgot one of our mains; you could see them picking something up from the freezer and briefly putting it in a microwave : [u'room', u'appliances']
Please stick with the buffet table it works much better : []
All staff helpful, cheerful and friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
That was not true : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The walk to Bali Collection shopping complex along the beach is about 8-10 minutes or you can use the shuttel bus provided : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It had a seperate shower and a jacuzzi bath, plenty of cupboard space, and an effective (and silent) aircon! : []
The Palace Club is a very special place in the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The resort itself is well maintained and in good condition : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The grounds of this resort are stunning and so well maintained : [u'overall', u'safety']
- Very beautiful cultural event ( dance and dinner) has been arranged in the hotel, a bit expencive ( about 100$ for two adults and one child) but all in all very good, pre-reservation is needed : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This leads me to one complaint about this hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I do have to stay the staff however are friendly and guest services dealt with our room issues quickly, even if it fixes took slightly longer : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Also, please make sure that rooms smell fresh : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We travelled through Java with our private guide Sonny and driver Hudda : []
All up this is a top option for accommodation in this area of Bali : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The 2,3 and 4 story wings of the resort are built round the central pools, restaurants and performance area, with quite stunning gardens and is close to the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Meals were of a very good quality (the Mee Goreng at Chess was superb) & the breakfast plentiful with great service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Stayed for a long weekend, attending an event at the convention centre just across the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Food at theme nights very average : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The facilities were excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It was delivered a few minutes later when I pushed the (minor) matter (though a whisper and snide comment passed between them) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The food is yum , the stay was comfortable, the rooms are cozy and overall a wonderful experience with family : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
There is a kettle for tea/coffee & you receive 2 bottles of water per day which is a nice touch : [u'amenities', u'conference']
All facilities and service were excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Go to Mas to visit the plantations : [u'amenities', u'garden']
I do feel that we were very restricted in dining options being in Nusa Dua : []
MY HEAVEN ON EARTH : [u'location', u'sea']
Overall we had a lovely and relaxing holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
you can enjoy swimming in there,good food,nice room and good service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just returned from 2 weeks at the Nusa Dua Beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
I also booked a hotel car to take me back to the airport after the conference ended : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The member's lounge wi-fi was no better : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Kid friendly with appropriate pools : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
That being said, the atmosphere was great and the facility was good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
All of the areas had a good amount of shade and sun for when that Bali sun just got too hot : [u'location', u'sea']
The beach is really nice although we are not beach people, beware of the beach sellers, they are around all day : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They clean it every day and the hawkers are polite & closely monitored : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The location is simply beautiful and relaxing : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Friendly staff , Beautiful pools & gardens , The hotel atmosphere was excellent : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had an unforgettable moment there : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We had a 4 night stay in this resort in summer 2012 : []
When our 20 month old son hurt his arm (not the hotels fault) they arranged complimentary transport to the hospital, followed up on his progress and sent him flowers to our room to wish him a speedy recovery : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Some of the newly renovated rooms are becoming more westernised but still very nice : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel, albeit a bit old, looks fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
At low tide the depth of the ocean drops to knee deep and very weed filled : [u'overall', u'culture']
If you want to eat outside the hotel, you can head out to Bali Collection is probably around 10-15 mins walk from the hotel, else you can also order a taxi to get out of the Nusa Dua complex : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Had a great time at this property : [u'location', u'sea']
Was a little tight, so wouldn't go smaller if you can avoid it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The place is baby friendly : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Yes there are so many of them than other hotels, and they are so much braver : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Surrounding suitable for jogging : [u'amenities', u'gym']
- lights outside your window stay on til midnight (same); : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
It was outstanding! (And I had my fussy partner with me) : []
Returned from this resort two days ago, use tripadvisor a lot so decided to write a very honest review about this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff at this hotel are so helpful and friendly, rooms lovely, grounds are stunning, beach front kept spotless and patrolled by security guards : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Kuta is 30 min away & Jimbaran bay 20 min : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Stay here if you want to enjoy the quiet side of Bali and relax in a quiet untroubled beach front resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was also a good base to go and explore areas like Kuta, Uluwatu, Jimbaran beach etc as they are all just 20 - 40 mins drive from there : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
If you want to relax and be treated like kings and queens then you must try this hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I would assume that these rooms have been refurbished : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Highly recommended hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If not, this hotel should be classed as a 3 star hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Although being quite large, it felt surprisingly quiet and I had some of the best sleep i've had in ages : []
The room was good very well appointed with a king bed which was 2 singles pushed together only complaints was it was a little firm : []
I would not pay what they ask now : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We had stayed 8 days at the NDBH and then left for Seminyak for 7 days : []
My son had his birthday while we were there and the hotel sent a complimentary cake to his room as a surprise - very nice and unexpected! The area outside the hotel was also beautiful, with wide footpaths and luscious gardens and we felt very safe when we walked down the road to the local shopping centre "Bali Collection" : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Room was a little smaller than we thought - service was great - variety of food available : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
food was brilliant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Accommodation was lovely : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
We tried almost everything : []
We travelled with 3 children aged 1 - 5, and the hotel was perfect for what we needed : []
You will notice the difference when you leave the resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very good location, just 15min-walk to Bali Collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We are now all in post holiday funk! : []
Would definitely HIGHLY recommend, and more importantly, will definitely return : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
regardless of whether you are dressed or not : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we told the receptionist that we want a room with good view : []
Beautiful hotel located on peaceful stretch of beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Beautiful huge property which is cleanly maintained,freindly staff,blue water private beach area,nice rooms,variety of swimming pools,restaurants of differnt kinds and relaxing spa : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Overall I recommend you go here for a 5 star experience in a grand, sprawling but not too busy hotel with great staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I usually travel on a shoe string and like to rough it so booking this hotel was a change for me due to having my mum with me, with that in mind I would not have changed the experience : []
yum, staff friendly and very accommodating : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Had a great time : [u'location', u'sea']
Check in was a miss : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Only downside was the walk to the main lobby and pool areas was around 10 mins : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Our clothes accidentally in contact with that and was bleached : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We will be back in the near future cannot wait : []
Our room (Premier Room) was a good size with balcony : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Tthere is a beautiful restaurant, Raja's Balinese Cuisine, that you need to make a reservation, but you are able to eat native cuisine in an intimate setting- try the Nusa Dusa Explosion Drink- yummy! One night we had sushi at Maguro Sushi by the Sea and it was good but expensive : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Would happily stay there again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for 6 nights : []
I was very surprised to find out that there was no free wifi in the room (which most hotels have now), and we could not make use of the free wifi in the lobby on the 5 occasions we went there to check email and do some banking : []
The food was fine, our first night we ate at the Asian bistro and had the rudest waiter, after this we did a mixture of going to the Bali Collection and eating out (Cuca is only 15 minutes away and I recommend a visit!) : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Beautiful location right by the sea : [u'location', u'sea']
I would definately recommend it to friends : []
On the one occasion that happened to me I headed down to the beach & had a 30 minute massage on the beach instead :) : []
Just returned from a four day stay at this magnificent Hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I wasted two days of my vacation getting there and back from Kuala Lupur : []
Anyway, the service during the check in was average, nothing special : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The biggest problem of our stay was the dampness of the room which I feel is due : []
We spent 8 days at the Nusa Dua Beach hotel, staying in an ocean view Palace Club suite : []
Also alongside these pools is a children's pool which is smaller and shallower : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel has change in size however managed to maintain the good atmosphere : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The New room was ok but small : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The trip out there, back & the meal in Kuta cost us less than the meal at the resort : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Staff we have experienced with are all friendly, however not the most knowledgeable as one would expect : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There are no cheep local restaurants (warungs) in the area : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The breakfasts are outstanding with about anything you would like ,you will find and if you don't, just ask and the staff will be happy to assist whatever they possibly can : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Booked through Luxury Escapes and loved every minute of it : []

The staff are absolutely lovely and very hospitable : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
My husband and I chose to finish our honeymoon at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : [u'overall', u'culture']
Spa treatments at the hotel are rather expensive and much cheaper ones can be found outside the hotel but if I had the money I would prefer the hotel as I found them to be more professional than the one at Bali Collection : []
The Gecko Kid's Club is run by women who genuinely seem to love their job and have a great choice of daily events : [u'amenities', u'patio']
You can walk or take a shuttle bus around the in enormous grounds, but you are always in a protected tourist enclave : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There was only one chair to sit on so television was watched from a very comfortable bed and wonderful pillows : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']

The hotel service was outstanding from the minute we were collected from the hotel - very friendly and welcoming : []
The guest population clientele at Easter was hugely Asian, a wonderful opportunity to practice our languages : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
- $25 for airport transfer (just step outside the complex and a taxi will do it for $10); : []
This hotel is more modern : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There was cleaning bleach left at the basin area and we thought that's water : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Mosquitoes are a problem to worry abt even in lobbies : [u'location', u'forest']
We chose this hotel mainly because of its lovely beach : []
We bought this holiday through "Ouffer" : []
We visit Bali often, but this was my first trip to Nusa Dua - and we WILL be back! The resort grounds are beautiful and the rooms comfortable - although a little out dated : []
Actually, this is just what we are looking forward to do the next Spring : [u'location', u'sea']
The only draw back is the air con in is a bit noisy : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We had a standard room with an amazing view : [u'room-experience', u'view']
Poolside beds were always available and drinks/food are brought to you there if you wish : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Loved the Spa area, except for the disruption of children under 12yo : [u'location', u'general']

Great to see the hotel's General Manager out and about, interacting with guests and making sure everything was up to scratch : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
What a frustrating waste of time! This is really unacceptable for a luxury hotel of this caliber that also caters to business travelers as well as vacationers : [u'location', u'sea']
Just stayed 3 nights in a deluxe room in Mid-August : [u'location', u'sea']
We got bored with the food by day 2 of our 5 day stay : []
The resort is beautifully manicured, the staff are so friendly and made us feel very welcomed : []
Hotel makes a very good first impression : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The setting at breakfast next to the koi fish-pond was soo calm & beautiful : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
There is few restaurants - balinese, asian, pizza and you can also eat on the beach bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I had the opportunity to enjoyed this hotel hospitality and services over 20 years ago with family, about a year ago I decided to go back and had a wonderful time : []
We had a late arrival at 8pm, the receptionist was very helpful to accomodate us to our rooms and offered welcome drinks : []
It is not the grandest, nor the most luxurious room or best breakfast-buffet but I just love it : []
Is such a five-star hotel service we received : []
The hotel is very traditional Balinese looking : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Saw that near by roofing / wall was in maintenance : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Thank you to everyone who helped us have a beautiful 12 day holiday : []
All areas of the resort came up to our expectations and more! The Manager and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful : [u'location', u'general']
Fortunately, we were not on the ground floor : []
Most guest are family or older couple all well behavd : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
we are not fussy people : []
Breakfast was fantastic and a great way to start the day : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
the employee never welcome or smile to local people i guess : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Cocktails are amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
the hotel is beautiful and huge, everything from the landscaping to the many gardens scattered everywhere was nice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Staff could not be more helpful and nothing is to much trouble for them, We will come back next year : []
Long balcony for them to play cars etc in : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The so-so side is that we have to get the corner room, but is also the best since we still have our newborn who are still had his cholic sometimes : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Geoff & Jo : []
The staff were fantastic : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Our stay was part of a package- 3 days after a cruise : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
It's a good resort for total relaxation though not for shopping or mingling with the locals : []
We were very lucky to see a turtle laying eggs on the beach one evening and the staff took great care to check she was OK and then ensure her eggs were kept safe prior to hatching : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The rooms are very nice, they maintain some Balinese style so are pleasant to stay in - most have balconies which is another plus : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We ate at the hotel's restaurants a few times and never got disappointed : []
Will be back soon! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Staff are very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We are currently staying at this hotel for 12 nights and can honestly say that up to this point our hotel experience has been fantastic : [u'overall', u'feel']
We decided to spend Christmas here as it is our favorite place in the world : []
Being a vegetarian there was range of food we could have for breakfast : []
There is a great running track past all of the hotels, best early morning before its too hot, plenty of outdoor activities eg snorkeling, canoeing : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The staff is great ,always smiling : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
all good except house keeping especialy amenity goods : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel Bali is probably the most authentic Balinese resort in Nusa Dua area : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The room was clean and large with lots of ornamental carving and wooded flooring it certainly felt luxurious : []
Not recommended, suggest having a look at the Laguna : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We usually stay in small boutique hotels so the buffet breakfast was a novelty for us, it was huge and delicious, also the setting for the restaurant is lovely surrounded by a water garden full of fish, the kids fed the fish from our table : [u'overall', u'culture']
an older style compared with the more contemporary resorts, it feels like Bali : []
This was our first visit at this resort, my wife and travel to Bali annually, and stay at 2 different resort which we had inspected the previous year : []
From the time we checked in the hotel gave us a wonderful experience : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Hotel so characterful, so 'balinese', beautiful gardens, peaceful, meals on the beach, lap pool - 10 pts : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Workers were awesome : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Everybody has a true smile here and the atmosphere is very relaxing and friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The shower leaked over the floor and flooded the room whenever it was used : []
The food is a good quality with no problems : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
For those who want a relaxing no hassle holiday this is the place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On the whole we enjoyed our week here and would recommend it to friends, will hopefully return again : []
Breakfast was scrumptious, had a wide variety from continental to Balinese, Asian & European food, always fresh & always fully stocked : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The hotel had 2 other pools, one of them had a swim up bar : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Breakfast is included in the room package, but do not have high expectation on food being served : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The beach walk is impressive with a long strip of 5 star resorts and it has a nice relaxing feel : []
However we stayed there 4 days, and were given the exactly same items for breakfast on each of the days ! Even the location of the items was exactly the same ! Also vegetarians beware, not much to choose from : []
The interior and exterior designs of the hotel is beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
visiting most of them I would say that they lack the charme of the Nusa Dua Beach : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Gardens: Immaculate and beautiful to see : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Is the food good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Still the best resort we have found in all Asia : []
that was also a premier room (so extra charge) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All good here with the location , service ,staff ,facilities at least worthy of 4 stars and apart from a few little problems we had a good time and tried to cancel our next hotel at a different area on Bali to stay here longer as it was great value : []
The room was small for the price paid : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Loved it : []
Probably because of the large number of guests (families & big groups), we observed a couple of conflicts but nothing major, and the holiday atmosphere remains : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
So-called Deluxe room a little tried : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We stayed at the hotel as a large group and the overall comments from our group is that they had a great experience, with just some minor issues here and there : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I would certainly recommend this hotel/resort to friends : []
The food is also good in all restaurants, if it seems costly there is a Bali Collection place with lots of cheaper restaurants nearby within 15 mins of walk : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Overall just an AMAZING EXPERIENCE :) : []
We will definately be returning here but the flight times from Scotland are something to consider (we stopped off in KL for four days on the way out) : []
I travel a ton and stayed in many hotels and no one has done this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The lobby bar had recently been renovated and i have to say it must be one of thee best locations to have a cocktail : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
roses, fresh fruit, towel designs etc : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The hotel was beautiful and the grounds were lovely, we can't really fault them : []
Also having to pay for Wifi and a DVD player was absurd : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Restaurants were a bit expensive and the service was a bit slow, but the atmosphere was great : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
I don't have a bad word to say about this hotel and will definitely consider visiting again if in this part of the world in future : []
The location is peaceful and the sprawling style hotel runs rings around any of the big hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Very friendly staff and a beautiful, peaceful setting : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nothing was lost when I returned to the hotel collect my laggages : []
I with a friend went to Nusa Dua for a nice relaxing break : []
We've stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel three times now and will be returning again next year : []
He made my boys time there so much fun : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Highlight was hiring the bikes for a morning ride along the coast : [u'location', u'sea']
We went to Bali for our honeymoon in September 2012 and completely fell in love with the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
Had a wonderful stay at Nusa Dua Beach over Easter and couldn't speak more highly of it : []
Service was very good, but I think that is more due to the culture and not the specific resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All our needs were met and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience : []
So much so that we determined to eat dinner anywhere else but here : []
Friendly staff always happy to assist : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is next to the spa and open to all guests : []
the pool was nice but very crowed as its a very big hotel, we couldn't find much shade around the pool : []
The service of the staff made our stay even more comfortable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I have never had this kind of service- perfect! : []
One day they made kites and then went out on to the beach to fly them, another day they dressed her up like a Balinese Princess and made temple offerings : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
A big disappointment cause it was 3 days after my check-in : []
I also indulged in one of their spa packages which was fantastic - the spa pavillions are very tranquil : []
But when I got one it was very bad : []
Luxury hotel with everything that we call heaven : []
I enjoyed a traditional massage in the Spa area for a reasonable price : []
Breakfast was included, it was varied and there were great choices of international foods : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The breakfast buffet was really amazing and the beach is lovely too : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We were below such noisy people for a couple of nights, but when brought to the attention of staff, we were upgraded and able to move to a very quiet room for the rest of our stay : []
the hotel was clean calm and friendly and loved the spa treatments, the beach and pool area are very clean ans average size waves to surf : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
The hotel grounds are very nice, there are 2 pools next to each other, 1 lagoon style and 1 freeform concrete, both a good size : [u'overall', u'safety']
We went to seminyak twice for a feast on the beach of fresh fish caught that day, you select your fish and they cook it for you, plus you have the bonus of an amazing sunset : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I stayed here with my two year old and she absolutely loved the pools, beach and the little playground : [u'overall', u'culture']
Service around the pool and restaurants was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The facilities were all fantastic and the Nusa Dua area a great location to feel safe, relax and enjoy a holiday and only a short trip to other popular areas, the transport shuttles were a great way to get around : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We found the rooms to be quiet enough - perhaps signs on room doors, requesting that guests be a bit more considerate of other guests and not bang their doors entering and exiting- would be beneficial : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We stayed for 4 nights and 3 days : []
The beach is good when it is high tide but during low tide there is no chance to swim : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Please continue doing what you are doing because it's working! : []
We had free cocktails every night : []
Our room overlooked the pool and had a partial beach view : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
This hotel will take your breath away with the structural and natural beauty! We HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a get-away vacation, wedding/honeymoon, or anything! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We chose Nusa Dua Beach Resort from all the good comments on Tripadvisor and new it would be very relaxing so thanks everyone : []
We booked the Royal wedding package and all I can say it was amazing in every way from the 3 : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We were fortunate enough to receive an upgrade to a suite which was absolutely magnificient : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I'll definitely return whenever I would want to stay in Nusa Dua : []
One couple had to be moved from their room because of bed bugs Also, one of the guests had to ask for a refund on the al a carte meal as it was sub standard : []
It was quite good : []
The hotel is just average and overpriced : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our 6-Day Family Stay at the Nusa Dua Hotel & Spa can only be described in one word - "Superb"! They really do understand the meaning of the word "Top Class Customer Service" : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We tried all but one restaurant Maguro including room service and everything was great value for a 5 star resort and of good quality, although the pizza was quite soggy and too cheesy : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The room was neat but the floors was slippery and the shower blocked up : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
A very late booking for a family and break and Nusa Dua delivered on all fronts : [u'location', u'general']
If you want some more shopping or fun at the water park, safari park it is easily accessible by taxi with the help of the new freeway : []
Indeed courtesy of the staff was immaculate throughout and they were about the most helpful I have ever come across : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are so many hotels along Nusa Dua Beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
There are other properties in the same vicinity and that give a better ambience and quality : [u'room', u'furniture']
but still OK : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
A great one and highly recommended : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
especially with children : [u'overall', u'culture']
The Bali collection is much cheaper for meals and drinks : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
- Rooms are clean and there are many options available (1 bed, 2 beds, 3 beds, bunk beds) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
There was security everywhere, at the entrance to the hotel and also at the shopping centre : [u'overall', u'safety']
Amazing and great place to stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The lobby was very spacious and airy and decorated in a modern Balinese style : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Wow and were the beds superb : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
You can get the best view during the day and night : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Except for an afternoon/evening in Legian and Kuta we spent the entire time relaxing by the pool or at the private beach : []
Cocktails are 5:50pm to 7:00pm but unfortunately there was no tables left, so we were pretty disappointed with our start : []
The Hotel is set in beautiful extensive grounds with a private beach, several pools etc : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A great hotel, offering the ideal combination of location, service and facilities : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We booked to stay here for 7 nights following a 12 day visit to UK, we were looking for a beach holiday and relaxation : []
We stayed for a week in there for our honeymoon, and was really looking forward to the experience in the beginning : []
My husband and I married here in September 2010 : [u'location', u'sea']
The only negatives was that i got charged to go and clean up a wound at the hotel clinic which incurred playing volleball : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Alternatively ,treat yourself to a 30 min ride to some of the dining delights in Seminyak ,now that it's a bit quicker to get to due to the expressway : []
The staff were sensational and extremely helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
In Nusa Dua we feel "grand" Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
So if you are coming for a great beach vacation, i may recommend to book a hotel away from this stretch which includes Westin and this property : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Beautiful surroundings, awesome facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The 2 swimming pools were clean and fabulous : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
As the first hotel in the Nusa Dua area; for me, it has the most authentic Bali feeling : []
We will definately stay in this hotel again soon! : []
Very great time : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bargain is must in BALI in everything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
First time to Bali and what a welcome : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The Hotel grows on you the longer you stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Not many options to eat if you are vegetarian : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The restaurant staff are very friendly and we remembered them from our previous stay as many of the staff have worked at this hotel for a many years : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This is the second time back at the same hotel we loved everybit of it but just a little disappointed where our room was so far back right at the end in the older section bit iether then that loved our stay staff so friendly definitely back again : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
2 Truly spectacular pools and the beach on your door step, The rooms and service was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Personally, i treasure the warm greetings from Pak Anom and Pak Raka : []
Been there 5 times, very good service, good food, going back, everybody is so friendly, we stayed at club suit, fresh fruit delivered every day to your room : []
Although this review is very pessimistic, the hotel itself is ok if you are aware of all this but of all hotels that ive stayed in around Asia, this was the most overpriced one : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This resort covers everyone's needs; from our young children to my elderly mother : [u'overall', u'culture']
I've seen many people on Tripadvisor moaning about the prices of the eateries but hey, your staying in a 5 Star complex so it's not that bad : []
I would like to thank Mr Peter Scholz the Resident Manager, who runs a very efficient operation and is always ready to go off his way to help you in whatever problems you may have : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The people who stayed here and said it is luxury have obviously stayed in a different hotel! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We will definatly be returning to this wonderful hotel which is perfect for all age groups : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The rating probably still exists as a nod to the architecture, the many restaurants, pools, spa facilities and immaculate gardens : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Superb,many thx : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There are several restaurants in the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Our first trip to bali in March 2014 : [u'location', u'sea']
I stayed in the room premier class : []
30 every morning which meant our family never slept past this time : []
They try to make money wherever they can : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
To our left are Club Med and Conrad and to our right; westin and laguna : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
09:30 ish in the cool of the "lobby area" to do the emails and catch up on the news via the complimentary wifi : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Nice ambiance, nice location, nice beach, nice pool, nice friendly staff, nice food (but gets a bit bored after a few days of routine) : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The only gripe I had was our room was close to the lobby and two nights in a row we had noisy nights with a wedding that went with Indonesian music til 1am the first night and then a DJ on the terrace the next night til 12am : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
After 6 nights at Bali Hyatt, Sanur we moved to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
I recommend the hotel only if you had to go there and you had no choice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had our 7th stay this year at the Nusa Dua Resort,at the Palace Club,we bought the package deal ,good value for money : []
And it's a short walk to the "markets" area just past the entrance to the Nusa Dua area and there's a free shuttle to the Bali Collection shopping area : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Since you are staying at a beach make sure you ask for a room close to the sea : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A big hotel with local architecture : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Only fault with the room is the bathroom is small to put stuff; the wardrobe doors are hard to open : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
After 6 pm the gazebos are free on a first come basis and make a very nice romantic spot for after dinner : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
Due to the Chinese New Year there were many Chinese guests at the hotel who insisted on spitting and snorting into the swimming pool and picking food up from the breakfast buffet to smell before they decided to put it on their plates! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
95 compared to 6 : []
Beautiful and friendly staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We loved lounging by the beach and the pools while having loads of drinks : []
I discovered that the Palace Club had been extended outside to allow for more tables, and that a small kitchen was now outside too : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Large variety : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The breakfast Buffett was a feast with every food for all nationalities : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I would definitely recommend this hotel, since it was our honeymoon it was important that the rooms were of a high standard, which means that the bed has to be comfortable, the room has to be clean, the bathroom should be new and have a tub and shower : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
We have made some long term contacts and loved spending time with these people : []
Adaptors included : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We enjoyed our stay at Nusa Dua Beac Hotel : []
Stayed after far east cruise : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Would definitely recommend this Resort to all who were looking to stay in the Nusa Dua area : [u'amenities', u'patio']
On the downside, the housekeeping and room service takes inordinate time and often we found we had to wait more than 30-45 minutes for simple things like a matchbox or an iron board to be delivered to our room : []
Overall a truly wonderful holiday and hotel, will be returning : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The plunge pool area was lovely though : [u'location', u'general']
Since the hotel is quite far from city center and shopping center, I was quite often had a lunch and dinner in the resto but its again, not that yummi and quite expensive : []
When you arrive to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, you are immediately in awe of the beauty and details around every corner : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hotel service was great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
My partner and I stayed in this resort for 5 nights at the end of January : [u'overall', u'culture']
The rooms were excellent, well maintained and spotlessly clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
this is far less than a 5 star : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we come with are 3 years old child : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We will definately be going back due mostly to their wonderful treatment of all their guests : []
A very good place to stay and rest with family : [u'overall', u'culture']
There were always sun loungers free and it was very spacious : []
We stayed in a 'deluxe' room (something of a misnomer) which is the cheapest option and were left a bit disappointed : [u'amenities', u'conference']
One of them, lagoon pool, is half filled with sand which is nice idea : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Although we both got Bali Belly we still very much enjoyed our stay : []
The people were really lovely, easy on the eye and so friendly - greetings and a smile from everyone I met : []
I had two free massages at the spa, the rooms were lovely but the massage was no better than the $7 : [u'amenities', u'gym']
-Spa is located by the lap pool : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
in the days of Ipads and Tabs, use of laptop is rare and suggest to the hotel management to make all rooms wifi : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
If u r willing to spend a little extra, its totally worth the money to book the palace club rooms : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Specifically we wanted a tropical beachfront resort to warm our bones in the Aussie winter and we got all of that and a lot more than we really expected : []
Everything went very well : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Have tried the lobby lounge,however, foods and cocktails are so-so : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
Eat at a beachside restaurant and bar called Kendi Kuning : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It will cost you around 90,000Rp or less than AU$10 in a bluebird to Kuta : []
The staff were well trained and very friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Staff need to watch people reserving poolside chairs early and not using throughout the day : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff were lovely and the facilities were beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If you are looking for a place to relax, your in the right place here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
how many letter should I leave?!! : []
Also must mention it's beachfront location allows for wonderful early morning walks along the Nusa Dua peninsula : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
This hotel is 4 : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff were very understanding and assisted with all arrangements : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Our rooms though were large and very comfortable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was our first time in Bali and we just want to keep coming back again and again : []
Nusa Dua has all these hotels by the beach and be rest assured you will not be required to step outside your hotel other than to jump into the water : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great memories : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The restaurants on site are excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
This was our 5th trip to Bali, and the second time we have stayed at nusa dua beach hotel and spa! This place never ceases to amaze us! The most friendly helpful staff, wonderful atmosphere and food!! : []
I had to work each morning and needed the wifi which had a very good signal : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Had only booked and confirmed it 2 hours earlier, and no-one could explain why it didn't happen? Ended up being run to the airport by the bell boy! : []
And the sea food combo by the pool or beach,doesn't get any better : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I reccomend it : []
depsite being veggies there was lots of choice and staff also offered to tailor the food to suit our needs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We traveled with one toddler and my parents, so we prefer a relaxed stay in one resort which provides us enough activties and has also some Balinese charm : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The laundry service, which many hotels turn into an extortion racket, was incredibly cheap : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel grounds were lovely : [u'overall', u'safety']
From the concierge to the cleaner, from guest relations to the bar person : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort itself is nice, with multiple food options : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Gecko Kids Club is excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
We fly with Singapore Airlines, they are just simply the best and we do a lot of travelling : []
Breakfast was great - lunch was okay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Another recommendation is to eat at Bum Bu Bali one of the best meals we had : []
the food was very clean and well prepared : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
This hotel is our second home no other resort gives to it guest as much as nusa dua beach does : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The extensive, but not overwhelming, gardens, grounds and low-rise buildings were immaculately maintained, and the staff were helpful and polite : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
there is no Internet in the room unless you pay 10 USD per day! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great place to stay but resort is very quiet with limited entertainment : [u'amenities', u'pool']
A longer though very enjoyable walk to the entry of the resort precinct gives you access to convenience and clothing stores as well as several restaurants and bars : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Gym was one of the hottest ones I have ever worked out in and they had run out of drinking water : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We put our son in the crib and locked it properly : []
one final point , if you are staying at the hotel when there is also a wedding , be prepared for much noise : [u'location', u'sea']
In comparison with the private villa, the staff are not really friendly, just average : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
However, that was until our last night when out of the blue they went back to table service which was a disaster : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Problem rectified the second time : [u'amenities', u'conference']
While I didn't face any issue, I don't have any extraordinary instance or gesture to talk about as well : []
Peter S, the GM of the hotel was a very gracious host and went out of his way to make me and my family (wife + 3 kids) feel completely at home : [u'overall', u'culture']
Hotel grounds, pool, and beach area very relaxing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They gave a brochure and expected us to remember everything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As Nusa Dua holds international summits and conferences, it feels very "western" as a place : []
I would definitely recommend this hotel : []
We had a fabulous week being spoilt : []
Moreover we stayed in the palace club which was even more fantastic : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Rooms are spacious and have retained a more traditional feel about them : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Beautiful surrounds, beautiful atmosphere, amazing staff, food and beverage was great and always served with a smile : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
we have been to bali 9 times now & stayed at most of the hotels a long that strip & this has to be 1 of the best we will be going back in march for our 1st anniversary thats how good it was : []
We had requested rooms (we had 2) facing the ocean or pool about a month beforehand and neither room got an interior facing room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
They do serve 3 different types of dishes every day, but probably my expectation on this is too high : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It was our second stay at this hotel : []
We got a good deal on a room, and the included buffet breakfast was mind-blowingly comprehensive : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The food prices were a bit higher than we had expected ( but probably to be expected at a five star hotel and with our poor exchange rate ) so we went into town most nights for dinners but the one night we went to the seafood buffet and fire dance at the hotel and it was excellent ! The breakfasts were amazing ! The hotel sent a lovely bouquet of flowers to my room on my birthday and when my son was sick with Dengue fever for our last few days there, the hotel sent fruit and flowers to his room as well : []
We made our reservation via the hotel website and had a quick response email confirming our booking : []
The food offered in the Club was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Had a lovely week at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We traveled with our 15 year old teenage son and he was even happy : [u'overall', u'culture']
He was 400,000 RPH for the day trip to Ubud and an extra $100,000 to the volcano : [u'location', u'mountains']
On a number of occasions the staff packaged meals for me to take back when my wife fell ill : [u'overall', u'culture']
So friendly and so willing to help you out with just about anything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pretty rooms, with some minor flaws that can be quickly remedied by good housekeeping : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We decided to go to this hotel as we brought a package through luxury escapes and decided to buy the upgrade to the club suite : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The warm water swimming pools is clean and clear as usual : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We stayed in Eastern Bali for the large part because we went there to scuba dive but we wanted to end our honeymoon in luxury : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I would struggle to recommend this hotel : []
Kids loved the pool and surrounds : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We stayed for 5 days : []
Yes, new bed is the keyword : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We were there in "Silent Day" when everybody had to stay in hotel and we enjoyed swimming in pool, having breakfast, lunch and dinner and we didn't want to leave the hotel : []
safe location and value of money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My husband and I first stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel 15 years ago on our own : [u'overall', u'culture']
The room was a bit disappointing; I paid extra money for ocean view, which was obscured by the trees in the garden, the room was attached to another, and we could hear the conversation in the room next to us; the shower (my room was with shower corner) had a small glass partition, which resulted in water splashing all over the bathroom; WiFi in the room is available at additional cost, which I find strange for a 5* hotel, while most of the restaurants in nearby Bali Collection offer this service free : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Will be coming to stay again! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
amazing stay at the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed at Kuta for 3 Nites and arrived here at Nusa Dua beach Hotel & Spa for a Truly Amazing Vacation ! The staff were very Friendly and Attentive all thru our stay : []
We had never planned to go to Bali but had a wedding to attend (which was fantastic) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Service during breakfast was also a bit slow, where there were a lot of tables not cleared and thus we found it challenging to find seats : []
My son 22 walked in and said 'this is a bit too upmarket for me : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
this place was beautiful : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
And very helpful staff while we staying there : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Not very happy about that but did connect in free areas easily : [u'location', u'general']
You won't find stainless steel and glass moderne here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a lovely time : []
They are constantly working to do this, but certain areas need it quicker than others : []
Stayed at the Palace Suite, a little more expensive but well worth the perks : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Generally we seemed to have two or three people looking after us when we were in the Palace Lounge (where meals and refreshments are served) : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Tasty fresh food, even raw fish and sishi : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The hotel could probably do a bit of a touch up here and there : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The gardens of this hotel and the outdoor spaces are the best part of this hotel : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Driver was waiting to pick us up at the airport (offered as part of the additional benefits package), which was a great start to the 7 night stay : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This is our 2nd time to stay at Nusa Dua Beach hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Gardens pool and beach area beautiful, well maintained : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Lovely hotel in a great location : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Would recommend for those wish to rest and relax, or honeymoon couple : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
They immediately locked all access to the room until I personally went to the lobby : []
The staff are absolutely outstanding and cannot do enough for you : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Staff friendliness, location and hotel facilities were all excellent could not fault any aspect : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A year has passed since our last wedding anniversary : [u'location', u'sea']
The massages were firm (upon request) and perfect : [u'amenities', u'gym']
I would defintely stay at this Hotel again, if visiting Bali : []
more families not really a young person place : [u'overall', u'culture']
Delicious freshly squeezed fruit frappes all day : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff are so friendly & bent over backwards to accommodate our every need : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed in a family room at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa a week or so back : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Thanks to Arini (customer relations) who sorted us out last visit (Mr Billy Williams), we have never looked back as far as accommodation in Bali goes : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our trip was ruined : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'others']
All in all a great time had by all!!! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We didn't complain as we spent most of our time around the spa area : []
Meals at the restaurant are many but kinda pricey : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Your attention to detail and friendliness of staff is much appreciated : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
With traffic these days in bali, it's useful not having to go into some of the other parts of the island : []
Food were highly overpriced and of low standard (especially after 2 weeks of Malaysian food) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We have been coming to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel since 1999 : []
Staff and management always helpful and cheerful, spa is excellent, fitness centre great (Owen is most helpful), restaurant staff attentive and knowledgeable : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We chose the indulgence package and the extras were fantastic : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The new part looks lovely and if you do find the restaurants and spa pricey there is a free shuttle buss to Bali Collection, where you can get a variety of restaurant to dine in : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I asked for an omelet and thanked the staff after received one : []
We will not be returning for the amount we paid for such service : []
This was a great way to spend a week of our honeymoon : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The grill at chess restaurant was definitely interesting : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Great facility, friendly staff, and sensational location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You'll feel conned daily, which doesn't make for a great holiday : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Restaurants were the same as all resorts : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Beautiful garden grounds(which our rooms overlooked), espectially at rear of "Special members Club" : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
**Side note-The gym could do with a power rack for free weight bench press and squats : [u'room-experience', u'privacy']
The grounds are full of beautiful flowers BUT none in the rooms : [u'overall', u'safety']
Not only was the journey quick and easy but the excellent hotel host took me through all the various stages right to immigration : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
), nice and always smiling staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Two large pools one with a swim up to bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The hotel is a bit far from things so it is not really convenient to other things except for the beach walking trail : []
In all areas of the hotel that I experienced, the staff was friendly and competent, frequently going out of their way to do special favors : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The AC was pretty good, but got a little bit humid through the night : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We opted for the palace rooms which had their private gardens and dining clubs : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Overall the resort Has traditional bali charm but needs a small amount of work to bring it back to life, the food is hit(Japanese restaurant) and miss (checkers by the oceanfront) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
They offer free shuttle service to & from, a great place for dining in the evening & paying half the price which is an up : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Internet is $5 : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We bought a package (see their website) that included accommodation, shows, dinners, hour long spa treatments, and it was amazing value : []
What more do you need? This was our second stay here and I was travelling with my 12 year old daughter who agreed this was a great place to stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach and swimming pool areas were very nice which is probably what makes this hotel so popular : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Had a free upgrade from Deluxe room to Premiere room : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Loved the spa and hopefully return soon : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Too much fun to play pool volleyball : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But bakery is fantastic!))) Also would like to mention two more disadvantages - that is the ocean and the Russians : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Food was excellent and service first rate : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Breakfast takes into account the tastes and needs of international guests : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
LCD TV's with DVD players, good linen, nice firm but not stiff mattresses, soft pillows, new towels, and many other aspects which is plainly obvious to have been recently put in place all make for a good value and a pampering type of atmosphere for people staying there : []
I had on overhead shower in my room and it wasn't running fast : []
We payed an extra $600 aus to be part of the Palace Club which gave us free afternoon tea and free cocktails in the evening, All handmade and very yummy : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I talked him into this trip with quite a bit of persuasion : []
The resort is beach front and the sand along with the water was very clean : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The pools are good and the food is also okay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The only thing we found was that the outdoor venue for the Legong and Kecak dances was too hot : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
My wife and I have just returned form our honeymoon to this hotel and i do not have a bad word to say about it! From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were made to feel welcome (as you are with most places in Bali) and the holiday went from strength to strength : []
It was actually a little ridiculous given it was a family room and sometimes more than one person needs to stand the bathroom at once : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And the breakfast buffet has everything you could wish for! Very highly recommended! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My friends bought the same Luxury package as ours & our kids stay together : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We travelled on a very early am flight and our room was ready to go upon our arrival at around 11am : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Hint- do not take any scratchies from the locals who claim they are not selling anything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Really nice clean traditional hotel in a beautiful location with well maintained gardens and pools by the beach with helpful staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
On our return : [u'location', u'sea']
the club wing is not facing the sea which is a negative but the rooms are nice : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
If you want total relaxation then this is the hotel for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We also ate at the Westin next door which was good and local restaurants : [u'amenities', u'conference']
You can also walk through the gates out the rear of the hotel to some local shops and a small store where you can buy beer and snacks : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hospitality,courtesy,decency, soberity all missing with Mr : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Lovely toiletries : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
' Apparently November is a very quiet month in Bali and the hotel was quiet too : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Lots of people staying at hotel but never felt crowded : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If you are not sure whether this is the hotel for you because you have small children, we can ease your concerns & definitely recommend it : []
We stayed from Dec 9 to 12, and the place was virtually empty, which was fabulous for us as we dislike crowds : []
Baby chairs available, again great for families traveling with young kids : [u'overall', u'culture']
We stayed at the hotel for eight nights and it over achieved our expexctations : []
We rode around the streets and then along the beach : []
Managed to book this hotel via its website for a Spa Delight package at a reasonable rate with the above-mentioned for an all-girls getaway trip! : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
The spa treatments and the massages were out of this world : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
All what I can ask for more option for "Halal food" : []
I really believe that it is the staff at Palace Club that make your stay an enjoyable one, and thank goodness they have remained the same : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We loved the lap pool : []
But being in a resort specific area of Bali the prices of everything were pretty inflated : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
What an amazing trip : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We went here for our honeymoon : []
Unfortunately they are undergoing building works when we stayed there (end ofbFeb 2015) around the main pool and the noise was a bit of a nuisance if you plan to sit around or eat lunch by the pool during the day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Again, I asked for this to be fixed and they said it had been fixed : []
I'm not fond of this system as choice is limited, and I feel that the food was far less enjoyable than it had been on previous occasions, and quality nowhere near as good : []
They often do more than expected to make your stay nice and comfortable : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
While this resort and area is a beautiful escape with a taste of Balinese culture, due to the location (Nusa Dua) going out can be a costly/timely adventure : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Hotel interior is really Balinese : [u'room', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Didnt think it was worth the money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We stayed in a Palace Club Room - would definitely recommend upgrading to the Palace Club : []
It was our first stop in our honeymoon : []
As an amputee and MS person the bed was to high to get into : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
Driving through the streets of Bali was an incredible experience, seeing the houses, shops and culture of these beautiful people was extrodinary and is important for all traveling to Bali to experience as this is the "REAL" Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotels decor and grounds were absolutely pristine and many relaxing hours were spent lying next to the Lagoon pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
It's a great hotel to just relax and laze around : []
The included Airport transfer was efficient and comfortable : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We would recommend getting a private taxi/driver for the day who will take you on a tour of the island, avoiding busy traffic times and waiting at the attractions : [u'amenities', u'patio']
However, I'm pleased to say that we had a fantastic time and the hotel was lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They have a lot of people from all walks of life and all nationalities to deal with : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We both loved the pools and restaurant facilities : []
The only disappointment was the beach facilities which were outdated : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Myself and my friend has a wonderful stay at this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Water quality was good : [u'overall', u'safety']
All staff are professional and treatments very good - in the luxury escapes deal - you can only have the scrubs, wraps or massages - I tried them all and were fantastic : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Opulence without arrogance, luxury without self consciousness : [u'overall', u'culture']
The rooms are looking a tad tired and definitely some new lounges around the pool would improve this resort even more : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Children can play in pool/lagoon area and have lots of fun : [u'overall', u'culture']
I had the steak and it was delicious : []
We had a great "Gourmet Dinner" at the Indonesian Restaurant and it was incredible, good taste and presentation : []
The rooms are large and the ground floor rooms leads out to the garden from the back door : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Great value for money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Nothing was too much trouble for any of your wonderful staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort is beautiful but lacks the quality, amenities & feeling of a 5star! The first night did not make a good impression but was certainly a lasting one!!! Chose to have the seafood buffet for dinner - found the food to be overpriced & terrible! The fire dancing was really nice but you can't eat that!!! The first room given to us had a drainage problem that resulted in a foul odor every time the tap was opened : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Spent one week there with family : [u'overall', u'culture']
I was really touched : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Good price-quality : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were there on some days with 90 % occupancy and it never felt too crowded, with sun beds available in shade at all times of day, however you are left to your own devices to secure them, move them around, etc, and this could certainly be improved with the help of poolside staff, who were often hard to find : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We had in room service and have also eaten at some of the restaurants, or had a drink at one the bars and there has been no food or service that we can complain about : []
The one odd thing about this place that I would point out is that they sell airport transfers for five times what it costs to take a taxi : []
Already planning our fourth stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We arrived late at night booking for 2 rooms, but lucky we got an upgrade room even it's only 1 room but we like it : []
I tried to explain this to the hotel guest liaison staff in the lobby, however their remedy was to visit the hotel clinic and send me some flowers with a nice card wishing me a good holiday stay : []
The management should be very proud of their outstanding and very happy staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
They had with them many children which was a bit annoying now and then : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Definitely a place for a romantic honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
Simply the best breakfast in all of Bali! Great facilities especially the gym and pools : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Luxurious :))) : [u'overall', u'spacious']
But this is a minor sin : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
He remembers our names and what we like to drink and is excellent at his job : []
Very cultural and balinese deco greeted us at the entrance to the resort and also the lobby : [u'amenities', u'pool']
I stayed At this property during my Business visit to Bali only for One Day and my experience is overall very good and best thing is the SPA of the property : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Spa massages were great and just added to the relaxation factor! Great path along the front of all the resorts allows you to get a little exercise each morning - if you want! We took the Luxury Escapes package and it was great value : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Our stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was a wonderful experience, we have stayed at several 5 star resorts in Nusa Dua area and this one is equal to all we have ever been to : []
The suite was luxurious in every way and spacious and clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The gardens were beautiful and well maintained : [u'amenities', u'garden']
If you pay the bill in cash (who does) change currency out side as the US$ published on the hotel site is converted to Rupiah for the bill : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There is a market down the road from the hotel where you can buy all your souveniors and do your shopping : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Location of the hotel is superb with its private beach with lots of beach chairs available : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Large number of children in palace club spoilt the ambience as parents thought little of other guests : [u'location', u'sea']
Locationwise, it is quite close from the Nusa Dua Resort gate (so it's easy to remember the way) : []
The pool area is pretty nice, although smaller than other resorts : [u'location', u'general']
No offers by resort to offer any complimentary services to compensate for problems in the room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
anyway we still managed to get our sleep later in the day, but some others would possibly go for a separate villa or at least an upgrade to the room (palace club or whatever its called) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel grounds, pool areas and beachfront were always immaculately clean and well presented : [u'overall', u'safety']
I would recommend that people watch the fruit carving demonstration by the pool, go for a morning bike ride with a hotel staff member, play squash, tennis etc : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Donal & Rosarie : []
Excellent & friendly service from the staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Stains are visible : [u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
I suppose this is just a ploy to extract more dollars from unsuspecting guests : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Recommended by a friend my daughter & I stayed in May 2014 : [u'overall', u'culture']
The beach however wasn't very nice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pools were varied, the proximity to the lovely beach was very very close & the Spa was top notch : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Staff were exceptionally helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The hotel was not full at all : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff couldn't have been more helpful, and we ended up having two nights in each : []
Was surprised that for the NEw Year's eve gala dinner at USD199 per head, drinks was excluded : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
They are limited in number and wear identifiable shirts : [u'room', u'clothing', u'bathrobe']
If you want a holiday where all you do is relax by the pool or get massages at the spa , go for a lovely stroll along the beach or some light shopping this is the best place to go : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bali convention mall is close by and they have regular shuttles from here : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I cannot speak more highly of this hotel & I must commend Urs (The GM) & his staff for making our stay enjoyable & memorable !!! Thanks Nusa Dua Beach Resort & Spa !!!! : []
It is the type of hotel where it does not look too upscale, but it is very vast : []
Breakfast bar outstanding : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Of course, this is a mature garden with 20 years behind it as well as a team of gardeners who maintain and manicure it to something like Chelsea Flower Show standards : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We travelled with a teen and the suite was a really good idea : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very friendly, a nice place to recharge : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They feed right from your fingers and some even jump on the pond's ledge : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The Chess Bar was great : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The breakfast buffet is fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Some people have complained that the rooms were old and needed refurbishing : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
we travelled with 4 couples (8 pax in total) and we were well looked after : []
Breakfast at the hotel was plentiful & varied with something for everyone : []
The hotel is large and clean but with a old withered look : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
my wife help me to decided it was a very good and valued offering : []
The theme dinners were $35 and little vegetarian options : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We got married on the beach here and it was just amazing, the wedding co-ordinator arranged everything for us and went above and beyond to make sure our day was perfect : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
A whole buffet would cost about $30 which is hardly expensive by international standards : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Kuta is a 200,000 rupiah one way trip by hotel taxi though it's 150,000 if you pay the driver directly! We were also charged for drinks out of the bar fridge we did not consume so be careful of this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
No stay is perfect but this one was very close, with the above comments to note, we will stay here again and hope to do so within the next 18 months : []
Our requested room wasn't available and we had to wait 45min with no information : []
The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful! : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It was served in a pineapple - loads of fun : []
An excellent stay as always too short and a long way from home : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub']
The rooms are very spacious with a very large bed!! walk i shower with complimentary toiletries : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our time and would recommend it : []
Grounds off hotel are great but maybe a little more shade would not go amiss : [u'amenities', u'garden']
My wife & I had a recent 8 night stay here using an online coupon with a number of extra inclusions : [u'overall', u'culture']
We still had to line up and gained no time as we had so hoped for travelling with small kids! Check in was very fast and smooth, however upon entering our room (family room/suite) we discovered no power, no cot as requested for our 2yr, and we (husband and wife) has 2 single beds! This was far from ideal given the late time of night after traveling all day with 2 tired children, however it was resolved fairly quickly, and our bed fixed the following morning : []
A great hotel to kick back and relax : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Mr G and his team are exceptional : []
Bit of mould in the bathroom but we are in a very humid climate so it is everywhere anyway : []
The food was really good, but a little more expensive than other parts of bali as other reviewers have pointed out : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
you are all wonderful!!!!!!!!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Only love breakfast buffet : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It is only 20,000-30,000 rupiah to get there : []
Best meal, Raja's on site for Balinese food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
I would definitely recommend paying the extra for the Palace Club which was exceptional : [u'amenities', u'conference']
All in all, the stay was average, would we go back again ?? Perhaps , only if we get a better bed or upgrade : []
Thanks for Reni (our wedding coordinator) finaly we got what we wanted : []
This hotel was absolutely amazing! The staff were extremely Friendly and the facilities were great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This hotel will definitely answer all your dreams for a perfect stay in Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
However, coming back to Bali and staying in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel changed my perception about the old hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We were mainly there for the wedding of our niece : [u'overall', u'culture']
Pool area is nice although a little crowded due to the holiday period : [u'location', u'general']
We used the shuttle to go to the Bali Collection Shopping Centre ,but all Restaurants in the centre provide free taxis : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Just wish I had more time to use it : []
return again pool bar the food was excellent breckfasts wher also excellent : [u'location', u'sea']
One of the things I liked about the hotel, which would probably be a downer for some was the overconfident wildlife : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
we will come back : []
5 to 5 star resort, please be prepared definitely not to South African or Japanese standards : []
Or only use them for an hour or so in the morning then leave their towels and come back in the afternoon for another hour or so : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The staff is very friendly and helpful but sometimes a bit unattentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
During our first visit in 2010 the hotel seemed to be lacking the customer service you expect from a five star resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
needed an extra room and extended stay, resort accommodated our request to the tee : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Everything was excellent, the breakfast spectacular! Also the staff were so polite and friendly that it was a pleasure waking up and seeing smiles all around! The only small issues we had were that the airconditioning was quite loud and the curtains could have been a bit thicker : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Can't quite get my head around all that weaving in and out amongst entire families on small scooters with no crash helmets : [u'room', u'clothing', u'bathrobe']
At least in non 5 star hotels you don't pay much and don't expect much even but mostly they offer better services : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
From the gardeners to the managers, all unfailingly polite, friendly and helpful and for the most part, efficient : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We have tried other places in Nusa Dua but we keep coming to back to this hotel : []
we booked just a standard room and was impressed with it's size and cleanliness : []
The outlet shopping there ok (pretty cheap), can buy a lot of bali items to take home with you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room overlooked the beautiful gardens which had a pond and some amusing resident ducks! It was so relaxing sitting on the terrace listening to the sound of the waterfalls : [u'amenities', u'conference']
-serving customer with same standard and not otherwise : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Room service daily : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The beach bar was good but the lobby bar was dull and lacked atmosphere : [u'amenities', u'patio']
There is also the Bali Collection shopping centre in Nusa Dua which is great to visit for lunch and a bit of shopping, the hotel operates a free shuttle bus there every hour, or you can walk which will take about 15 mins : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Location was great : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
the spa pool is relaxing, refreshing and secluded, great for a late afternoon swim : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Very friendly/welcoming staff, endless facilities and beautiful grounds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff, grounds, room, spa, food, drink (my favorite new cocktail is a Palm Mojito) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Was very impressed by the hotel's amenities : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Thank you Palace Club for making my stay so memorable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast was superb! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
An Extremely peaceful &relaxing place to stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Not up to modern standards : [u'overall', u'safety']
People are manipulative and decisive : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel is situated in a convenient location, near the airport and within 30 minutes of Kuta : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast choices were 5 star with freshly cooked eggs, omlettes & pancakes, excellent breads & great coffee along with local and traditional western breakfast ingredients : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Breakfast buffet was very very good! Anything you could imagine having for breakfast was there : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
This was a shocker, I ordered some beers & my bill was in some millions, until you realize thats in the local currency : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Hotel Spa has the best prices in the area (these are simply fair) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However, we will still be coming back to this hotel when we visit Bali agian : []
The hotel were fantastic in helping us get to the hospital and assisting in any way possible : []
My biggest concern was if I was unwell and called for help no one would understand and that frightened me so much that I wanted to leave the Hotel and find another one or go home : []
No free wifi in any rooms, and lobby free wifi is super slow : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The breakfast buffet was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Upon arrival at the Nusa Dua Hotel, severe illness struck and I called for a doctor to come to the room : []
I wouldn't recommended the bali dance theme night, the food was of poor quality, and the dancing was laughable : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I dragged my husband to Bali 3 years ago to Seminyak and he vowed never to go again : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Breakfast is nice but needs more variety of bread(they had only variety of white breads), cheese (had only 1 type of cheese) & salami(had only ham & chicken roll), & if you want to order eggs benedict it is extra charge : []
the staff is very gentle! Just one thing, try to don t have your meals in the hotel restaurants, the quality is not good, and prices are expensive! : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
and very good food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We spent New Years Eve at the hotel : [u'location', u'sea']
Crew help very much : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Appreciated the ladies only sauna and jacuzzi too : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We stuck with the food not spoiled by the chef : []
Local markets at entrance to Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We will definitely come back to this little piece of paradise : []
We arrived after a quick drive at the N : []
Spa was nice, I'd give it a three star rating : []
Purchased a package which is similar to those available f4rom the hotel web site : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I can find absolutely no fault with this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We accidently booked during school holidays however this didn't prove to be a huge issue as there was enough space and room at the pool/beach so that we weren't fighting for a beach chair or tables at the restaurants : []
They're just amazed us : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We were pleased with the gracious knowledgeable service staff, especially in the club : []
food is amazing, breakfast was really good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Baby and children's pools were old and not maintained : [u'overall', u'culture']
the high light of our trip was the pool bar attendant MUSHARDI ,,, he has been there since opening day and he has perfected the pool bar atmosphere in the 30 odd years ,,, drinks and food expensive on local standards , but on par with Aus prices , but you expect that at 5 star resorts on the beach ,,, would I go back YES , would I do buffet dinners NO , it was our 10 wedding anniversary and we had paid for a pool view room , the AC Unit was broken and they upgraded us to a Club room , but no pool view that was a disappointment as we were separated from the rest of our party , the hotel did not charge us for the upgrade to pool view as compensation , but I would have preferred the pool view as it was just a nicer setting : []
We love it : []
Taxis are also dirt cheap so you can travel to neighbouring Kuta or Seminyak for a change of scene/cheap meal : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool is excellent, and the spa services also, even if a bit expensive : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Luxury Escapes - this was a good deal, we got free laundry for one day unlimited, 3 dinners with 3 different shows (although I thought the food was awful- see above) and the shows were very good : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
I do agree with the other reviewer, they need to fix the wifi problem : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We asked for an additional single bed which was placed in the living area which effectively turned it into a second bedroom for us : [u'amenities', u'conference']
And, The 1st room I got was far away from the sea and the garden, outside my window was a construction site, it was really noisy : []
It had a bath tub but the shower was in the tub when we were expecting a separate shower; the latter I may say is usually the norm for 5 star hotels, at least in Asia it is : []
Just like in paradise : [u'location', u'sea']
The food left much to be desired, although breakfast was good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
After the day trip, we also stopped by Kuta Beach to shop around and did foot massage : []
Son and family rated it 4 star for their family experience : []
Had to use the kid's room to access the garden : [u'amenities', u'garden']
If you eat at each food event you pretty much dont need dinner : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua is a bubble far removed from the "real" Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Luckily you could avoid them mostly, but its not what I expected from this type of hotel (and probably not something they can always avoid I guess - although maybe not serving Bintang in the pool until lunchtime?!) : []
should increase services : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Very nice resort especially for family : [u'overall', u'culture']
Was rectified too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Being an Aussie, I get really irritated by prices being listed before tax and service fees : []
Think small mall, rather than anything too grand, but worth a walk round : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Perfect spot for romantic getaway : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Altogether it was perfect hotel specially for couples : [u'overall', u'culture']
Alot of time spent in the pool which was surrounded by lush gardens : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Hotel staff are patently unhelpful when you ask about getting a regular taxi : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All the staff at Club Lounge were exceptional and a pleasure to meet : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Great garden : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This place has all the amenities needed for a fantastic holiday : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Would love to re-visit one day : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Beautiful reception area lobby bar and can't wait to go back to see the new beach front restaurant and bar finished : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
WiFi is available free in the lobby area but again unreliable and for a hotel that supports an array of telecommunication infrastructure both within and for the local area it was a little poor : []
3) The wardrobe door fell out and had to get the maintenance guy to come in and fix it : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
From the moment you drive into the resort you feel impressed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I politely said no, we had booked a "Superior Room", but you have housed us in a "Sub Standard Room" : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A beautiful Balinese style hotel with great facilities, bars & restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I was advised to come back after an hour : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
After having stayed in small boutique hotels and private villas, this hotel was too big and un-personal for us : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Charming hotel with plenty of character : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The view from the breakfast area is beautiful, ponds, fountains, fish, geese, squirells all doing their thing while you sit back and plan the day ahead : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
30am )which really did make us all feel like we were a Royal family : []
The Palace Club is worth the extra money which includes afternoon tea with sandwiches, cakes and then cocktails in the evening with hors d'oeuvres : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Great location and fantastic place for our kids (age 10&12) : [u'overall', u'culture']
There was a welcome fruit basket in the room on our arrival containing some varieties that I had never tried before, including my new favourite fruit: mangosteens! There were also two bottles of complimentary bottled water, replenished daily, though they had metal caps requiring a bottle opener, yet we couldn't find a bottle opener in the room- luckily we had one of our own : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The restaurants are fine we has nice shushi in maguro and lovely pizza's in Sandro's : []
We usually left the hotel, stopped a taxi and went out for food (restaurants out of hotels are very cheap and good) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Gorgeous, long sandy white beach : [u'amenities', u'pool']
I stayed at this hotel for three nights in February 2013 : []
However, there was some changes to the itinerary that I cant make it to the spa on the 3rd day : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
There is a large selection of restaurants within a short cab drive from the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
The 2 nights went smooth, but our last day were not so good : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
About the only downside I found was that the restaurant selection in the resort is a bit limited, and it is a bit of a pain to go out of the resort (other than a free shuttle to a local shopping mall, which has a selection of restaurants, but why stay in a resort if we was to take the shuttle outside to eat?) One night we took a taxi from the hotel to Kuta (100k fixed price to get there, but you are on your own to find a ride back) for dinner, which was a nice change : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed here in April for our honeymoon after getting married at a villa elsewhere in Bali : []

We tried all the restaurants and the food and service was outstanding : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Most of the staff we spoke with had worked at the hotel for 15-20 years and all of them told us how much they enjoyed working there : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
As I mentioned before, the pools, beach and playground are great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We had no problems, but sitting on the patio outside your room, it feels a bit public : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The surroundings are very relaxing and the layout is very user friendly : [u'amenities', u'internet']

One of the families we met there in the pool travelled to value regularly (they were from Perth, so very easy access with quick short flits) and they had stayed in a number of hotels with their young children and felt this was the best due to the pools - they are by kid friendly with a little sandy beach sloping gently into the water : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We should have taken swimsuits in hand luggage rathen than wait in the heat for a couple of hours for room & luggage : []

So typically you couldnt fall asleep until midnight as there was music outside and then there would be someone kicking their doors nearby at 6-7 am : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
It took almost 36 elapsed hours to get from San Francisco to Bali but we found the Nusa Dua very comfortable and relaxing once we got there : []

You have to take a taxi to wherever you go : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was musty, the bathroom was dated; the bath (with shower over) was stained, had a rusty bath plug, black, mouldy sealing around it and it took almost 30 minutes before the water turned from black to clear : [u'amenities', u'pool']
My advice is to try another and see if you get more for your money there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

staff do their job but lack warmth when compared to the Westin Hotel which we have also stayed in three times : []
By 8 : []
I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone : []

Lots of activities to keep you entertained : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This area seems to have been created solely for tourists : [u'location', u'general']
There is security on the gates but it is only a short walk to the local village market where you can barter your but off for amazing bargains : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Having read the many reviews on Tripadviser regarding this hotel, I was confident that this would be a great hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hotel staff was very courteous and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I felt very safe as a lot of security was around : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Only feedback would be that the pools should remain open longer (to 9pm perhaps?) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Rooms comfortable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed at this hotel over Easter and it really surprised us with just how relaxing and fun it was! We went on a Luxury Escapes Voucher which we used for the first time and we were really impressed with it : []
Spa and Gym, 3 nice pools, good clean private beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I want beach walks, relaxing by the pool and experiencing Bali's fine food, while the kids have vast grounds to explore in a safe and clean environment : [u'overall', u'culture']
Although it was a rather old hotel, its grounds were wonderful! The entrance gate to the hotel was very impressing : [u'overall', u'safety']
Disappointed that although the local staff were stressed by our distress at having children run round during the cocktail time, the management was not interested in responding to our feedback : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Once in the pool, if you manage to dodge the balls being thrown around, you will notice a thick carpet of algae covering both the island & swim up bar walls : []
The Chess bar on the beach with free juice and coffee to watch the sun come up each day was magic : [u'amenities', u'patio']
It has an open-plan kitchen and we chatted with the chefs as they were preparing mouth-watering regional dishes : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

The beach was beautiful, much better than we had expected : []
The staff are all friendly and attentive, but also relaxed, so we felt very relaxed (as opposed to some hotels where it is very impersonal) : []
We are a middle aged couple with walking problems so if you are the same request a ground floor room as this is a big resort : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Stayed here for 5 nights and enjoyed every moment of our time : [u'location', u'sea']
Bathrooms definitely need to be renovated : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Drinks were sometimes 2 for 1 but then other times not at the same restaurant and time or day - which just baffled us : [u'amenities', u'conference']
With the sole exception of a lack of clear identification of the location of our room, there was nothing that we could fault, from the time we were collected at the airport, until we checked out : []
This is a good resort to stay and relax avoiding daily problems : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
whether it be for a weekend or 6 1/2 weeks (like me) : []
Our favourite squirrels came to visit every morning and afternoon to munch on snacks with us : [u'amenities', u'garden']

The beds are also pretty average and the air conditioning blows directly onto one side of the bed : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
We stayed in palace club room on the ground floor at first I wanted a higher level but it was perfect with children as the garden area that our room opened on to was a very safe haven for them! The staff in palace club are amazing nothing was to much trouble ! The hotel itself I just love it's beautiful it's location is fantastic I absolutely can't wait to come and stay again !! : [u'location', u'general']
Themed buffet dinners are available most nights or the pizza restaurant is good for a cheaper, more casual dinner : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The beds are huge and very comfortable : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
The Palace Club facilities are well worth the upgrade : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The pools are a bit boring for young kids but are big : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The manicured lawns, the fruit trees, the immaculate beach, the great pools, the room service, the room size, the service in general, all excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Instead of drying up the atmosphere for some reasons : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, the rooms are a little smaller than at other similar resorts I've stayed at and could do with some updating, especially the big scratches in the floor from the bed : []
15am in the morning : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
I had one spa treatment which was very good but not the best I've ever had : []
Highly recommended for a family break! The property is really well maintained, clean and has all the 'resort' features a family needs : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The best meal of our entire trip was when we did a half day trip to Jimabaran Bay : []
The hotel has a beautiful lagoon pool, a kids pool and is situated on one of the nicer stretches of beach in the area : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel is not modern but rather luxurious and tradional : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

The spa treatment I had was delightful : []
I love it and is clean as each day the housekeeping clean it : []

KUTA is only 10,000 rupiah ($10AU) in a blue taxi from & to Nusa Dua Beach : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
All in all a not to be missed place and we are so please to have made it part of our special tour : []
Could not fault the breakfast buffet : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Breakfasts were awesome and service was first class : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
you find yourself trying to learn some basic balinese greetings just to say thank you etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All beach sellers are licensed and you will get none of the hassle you may experience at Kuta beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
sunrise mornings are gorgeous and the staff await you sitting and watch the sunrise in the beach with coffee and drinks,a great way to wake up to each morning : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Even though it was a resort, I found the prices to be a little high on most food and beverage for my liking : []
Staff were very friendly and overall the restaurants were good : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The deck chairs here were also better quality and the spa staff even brought complimentary water and snacks to the deck chairs : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had several drinks at Chess Bar and were always welcomed by the staff there and a number of meals at Chess in the evening, which were quite good and surprisingly inexpensive : [u'amenities', u'conference']
- The hotel taxi service is about 200% more expensive than walking out the front of the hotel and flagging down a Blue Cab (which are very safe and clean, etc) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
While we were there, the hotel had high occupancy and so the breakfast queue was long but still the staff did a commendable job keeping things going and guests happy : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Great food and prices at all the resturants, great food also at other hotels and Bali Collection nearby, all easy walking distance : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The only negative would be the buffet theme nights : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
If I visit Bali again will prefer to stay here again : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
With this in mind, better security on the balcony doors would be recommended : [u'overall', u'safety']
Takes approx 30 minutes with driver to go to Kuta etc : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Another thing, the hotel's breakfast buffets is sumptuous but I do hope they change their menu : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Lovely hotel, very close, 5 min walk to the Convention center : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We were lucky enough to get the ground floor and were just a few steps from the pool area : []
Some small negatives : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

I think my heading itself explains everything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel provided us with a wheelchair free of charge not only for the immediate crisis but for the rest of our holiday : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

The service is very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
You can as we did, use this as a base for day trips to all parts of the island and then as a welcome respite after travelling through the absolutely chaotic but slow traffic - there are no shot cuts or quick routes to anywhere in Bali ! or you can while away the days poolside and on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The most fantastic feature of this hotel is the unmatched beach and the swimming pools facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The garden is nice and quiet to stay in : [u'amenities', u'garden']

A special thank you to the staff in the Palace Club with who we fell in love with : []
Everything was perfect, highly recommend : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Main pool was excellent but I didn't like the "beach" pool as the sand was very stony and hurt my feet : [u'location', u'sea']
Now these guys not only have great food but drop you back at the hotel too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We will be going back : []
Spent 2 nights at the resort, rooms are spacious and clean (traditional Balinese decor) : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
I think beach area of this hotel is the best location and facilities in beach area are the best for example gazebos : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I have to say the staff here are easily the best I've ever had the pleasure to meet at any hospitality organisation - every single staff member greets you with a smile and loved to have a chat : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Sad to have to go to that extent but unfortunately some people are not as considerate as others and this is not a hotel fault but a human one : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This really is a great place for little ones, sand shallow pools and Gecko club really good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
despite of the food, i will come back to stay : []
Staff couldnt be more attentive and child friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast are cooked to order and if that's not enough there is a full buffet choice as well : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Food was good and we tried several different restaurants : []
Ten minutes walk from hotel is the Nusa Dua gate and here I found great shopping, Yanti the best massage ever, and the Tavern restaurant (4 star TripAdvisor) : []
- The rooms and the whole resort is extremely well maintained : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The staff is super friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It is good to breath the fresh air every morning : []
This hotel was ok : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The food on offer was not reflective of a 5, even 4, star resort : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
3rd time I've stayed at Nusa Dua Beach over 13 years and although it has had updates over the years, it could do with a refresh : []
The buffet breakfast is really good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Hotel breakfast was supplied in the palace club, however with 2 kids waiting for food to be cooked in tranquil surroundings isn't ideal : [u'overall', u'culture']
A big plus was that our bath towels were changed twice a day (a god send in a hot climate when you like a clean room to come to after creating a mess after the pool or beach visit) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It has been very well maintained and the established gardens are beautiful! There's lots of shade, and the beach is a lagoon style and tidal, and is also very clean : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The hotel is incredible and the staff are very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This is only half true : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We absolutely loved our stay at the Nusa Dua hotel : []
I know it's been two years since we stayed here but I needed to write to say just how much we absolutely loved our stay here!!! The grounds are so well kept up, the service is amazing!! The natives are so incredibly thankful to you for visiting : []
Look out for the offers on massages : [u'amenities', u'gym']
It was a really High price for The slow service, average food and bad tasting drinks, and we vad not very manu choices when it came to food either : []
On the bright side, the staff are really helpful and welcoming but I would definitely chose another hotel next time I come to Bali : []
The rooms are a bit old and not very nice - no ventilation in shower, makes the room mushy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Walk down towards the gates and you will find many drivers waiting to be called by the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would differently stay here again but would pay the extra and stay in the club lounge : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
I am someone who can never sleep on hotel pillows and I slept like a baby here : [u'overall', u'culture']
The menu was always same everyday, a variety might best for guests that stayed for a week like me : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The choices are the same every day but there are SO many choices that you can have something different every single day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rest of the hotel was wonderful and I never heard a bad word said about it, we walked right along the beach past a lot of hotels and although they all looked wonderful we reckoned ours was the best : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
) Reception will give you the access code : [u'amenities', u'banquet', u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
By no means a bad hotel and very good value for money - just be aware of its shortfalls : []
I'd go back there in my next vacation : []
Always greeting you with a lively smile : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hidden gem, best ever hotel with incredeble luxeury : []
We enjoyed relaxing by the water, soaking in the sun w/generous amounts of arak (well, tequila anyway) : []
Being a small island there is no train / tram / metro service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We were sick whilst there and saw the on site nurse : []
we stayed at this hotel for 10 days and the service we recieved was second to none the manager even sits at a desk in reception with his name in front of him : [u'overall', u'culture']
The stay did get better from there but while dressed like a 5star, this hotel is by no means one! The staff is kind of hit or miss - either fantastic or not! The rooms very standard & dark : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We chose this resort as family were attending a wedding( we were not) and we travelled with them afterwards : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The General Manager of the Hotel is a Swiss very kind man and you find an Irish young lady here calles Sinead : [u'overall', u'culture']
staying on my own I felt very safe everywhere within the resort and all the staff were extremely helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It's only saving grace were the very friendly people who sorted out our room each day : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We booked an 8 night package through Luxury Escapes : []
Prefer the first one : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
30 PM and suddenly the balcony's light were off : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
And by the way, this is my first time visit to Bali in 40 years LOL : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room was lovely and we have no major concerns : []
The greeting from the staff when we arrived round 10pm or so was very average with no cold towels to refresh nor a fresh welcome drinks that we often accustomed to by staying @ 5* hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
This is definitely an area which the hotel needs to work on : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I walked down to a local tour agent out the front gate and I got the same tour for $40, which was brilliant : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Even though this was the room booked through Luxury Escapes the picture on the internet upon booking was far larger : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Fantastic, very personal service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Lovely gardens,ducks,squirrels and aquatic life made it a joy for our grandson as well : []
We ventured on an evening to other hotels along the strip but found that the same entertainment seemed to be on in most hotels : [u'overall', u'culture']
We figured out pretty quickly that it only takes about 15 minutes to walk to Bali Collection (via the beach, which is mostly shaded along the path connecting all of the hotels) or you can catch the free shuttle (but this does not operate at lunch or dinner time!) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
An unforgettable holiday in a truly fantastic hotel! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The spa was fantastic and my 2 daughters thoroughly enjoyed their pampering sessions : [u'overall', u'culture']
I came with two girlfriends and we had a lot of fun : []
The staff are genuinely welcoming all day long, and the food has been exceptional : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Beautiful hotel, beautiful beach, many amenities, great for families or couples, breakfast buffet is phenomenal, spa and gym facilities are very clean and nice, friendly staff, multiple restaurants on site with a variety of foods, you never have to leave the resort if you don't want to : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You can walk along the beach to the Bali Collection during the daytime, its take about 15-20 minutes or you can walk along the main roads, which is quite safe as Nusa Dua is in a sort of gated community with security at the entrance : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Perfect place to unwind and relax : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Expect to pay astronomical prices for wine, beer, etc : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
We stayed 4 nights at this hotel with our 2 tween daughters : []
We didn't eat at the resort, instead we went outside the gates to a nearby market area to eat, easily 80% cheaper than the resort restaurants : []
Well worth the price : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Whether lazing by the lagoon pool or sipping a cocktail on the beach in the natural shade of trees overlooking the Indian Ocean or having a Balinese massage at the spa this hotel has a long list of indulgences that will take you to a level of relaxation that will make you feel like you have been on holidays forever!!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The white beach was lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Would definately stay there again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We are a couple in our sixties and have had in the past many concerns about travelling to Bali due to security risks but, in July of this year we decided to take the plunge and planned a trip to Bali for a week in early August , and how glad we are that we did : []
I stayed 5 days in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa last summer during my honeymoon in Bali : []
The overall stay was pleasant and the rooms are clean and tastefully decorated with heavy hint of Balinese style : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, some of our friends had issues with the front desk during check-in and check-out, where the room cost was already paid but was it was not reflected in the system : []
The gardens are expansive and the pool areas are great : [u'location', u'general']
The pool bar is also nice : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Apart from that, We loved it : []
During the stay at this hotel, I felt that services of the hotel especially at breakfast is too poor : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I absolutely LOVED the coconut scrub & the Aloe after sun wrap was a deliciously cool blessing! Although our spa treatments were complimentary we did not receive any different treatment, we were welcomed politely, given ginger tea & offered the use of ALL the spa facilities (including Jacuzzi, spa & sauna, gorgeous quiet pool, tennis courts & gym) : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Especially to the senior manager Dermott for looking after our young family when we stayed recently in late February : []
I have heard many positive comments about Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa from my girlfriends : []
Additionally the balcony/shutter doors need a privacy net curtain, a net screen would also be welcome to keep out pests( such as the squirrels, which were reminiscent of flying rats) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
that night we climb into bed, 1 bed had dirty sheets and the others sheets were all wet : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
We spent a week here after being in Ubud at the Royal Pita Maha and thought we were going to another 5 star hotel, but it didn't feel like that was the case : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were superb, nothing is too much trouble : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was clean and spacious : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Dinner was nice but i must say it was littlebit overpriced : []
We too had three buffet dinners and couldn't fault the facilitation of these, other than drink service being a little slow, but hey, it's a huge undertaking to provide good quality food for so many people over about 3 hours : []
If you go to Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa was a treat : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The spa is one of the best I have been to, the resort is so well kept and the staff are all so friendly and genuine : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Top class service : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Stayed here for 2 weeks from Aug 7th 2014, travelled as a couple : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I thought the breakfast was really good considering it is included, agree that the other restaurant meals are expensive (especially since i have now traveled to other parts of the island) and it is not that motivating to go off site since everything close by is likely as expensive : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
awful smell : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Short walking distance to local market and some bars and restaurants : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'bike-ride', u'amenities', u'shopping']
we look forward to coming back soon! : []
good service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The kids club was ok, but the kids didn't really seem to want to go back like in other resorts, it's an area that could be improved : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is spotless : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We had a 10 day stay here and I cannot praise the staff enough for their attention to detail, and the enormous efforts they go to , to make the guests happy and enjoy their stay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
i've been staying at many resort in nusa dua area, such as hyatt, laguna, grand nikko, ayodya : [u'location', u'general']
Air conditioner doesn't really work (especially at night) and there is no way to adjust the temperature : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The spa was topnotch : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
However, when i first reached the resort, i was impressed that the resort was well maintained : [u'amenities', u'pool']
In the morning me and my father take a walk at the side of the beach there's a pedestrian path and jogging track and it's connecting to other hotels so it's a long walk around 20 minutes : []
huge swimming pool : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
room should be more clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We got 2 adjoining ground floor rooms for a great price : []
Loved Nusa Dua and the white beach and blue water : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We spent most of our time inside the Hotel : []
On arrival our room was not ready and upon inspection proved far too small for 3 adults : [u'overall', u'culture']
The spa centre is heaven from facials to massages : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The free cocktails were enjoyable every time : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
We went for our honeymoon and felt Seminyak is a way better area if you want upscale dining and a cooler beach atmosphere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are few other problems that we encounter while staying in there : []
I explained that I was willing to pay for it and I had gotten it the two days prior but he insisted that it wasn't an option for me : []
We're glad we spent 3 nights in Ubud beforehand for a more 'real' experience : []
The staff, the pool, the beach were completely wonderful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The food are quite good, though a little more variety and asian food will be appreciated : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
So alltogether we had great time in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and we recomend it for everyone who want to experience the traditional balinese hospitalyti over this luxory and relaxing location! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
There was a miscommunication so we didn't get picked up at the airport but they were quick to upgrade our room and offer free return transport to the airport : [u'location', u'airport']
While other hotels tried to be as modern as they can, this hotels remains the balance between traditional and also modern : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Hotel is spotless, staff are friendly and lots of room to relax : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The restaurants & bars are quite expensive & not very good quality, with the exception of the Japanese restaurant, which served good sushi : [u'amenities', u'conference']
One staff member in the Club really stood out with her service and friendly nature : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Overall our stay was pleasant and I am giving it a 4 star due mainly to the wonderful staff who were very friendly and helpful : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Drinks were really expensive food at Mugaro and the Raja's fantastic, other options were poor : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Breakfast buffet had a good selection however the other restaurants and drinks within the hotel were pricey and not value for money : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
It was fine, but it would not rave about it : []
It is one of the most beautiful hotels in Nusa Dua,this was our second stay and again it was fantastic from rooms to staff and service : []
I have stayed at this property at least half a dozen times ( in : []
Was very disappointed the the room I was given was on the ground floor : []
This was our third stop in Bali, and it was wonderful : []
A really fantastic holiday in this beautiful & relaxing resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I phoned at 9am, was welcomed warmly as a returning quest and checked in at the Palace Wing by 10 : []
There is a certain amount of night life but not the place to go if you are looking for wild nights but Kuta offers quite good entertainment : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Staff at the desk, some confusion : [u'room', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'conference', u'elevator', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk', u'post-room', u'checkout']
We misinterpreted what this meant as we thought it was a fast track/express through customs bypassing the long ques, however, it was meerly a staff member purchasing our VOA which we were capabale of doing ourselves : []
There are many water sport activities based on Benoa, so you have to go to Benoa first before you do anything else : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is not firbidden, but there's simply no water to swim in : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Large beautifull garden ,everyting very clean , situated residentiel and on the beach : []
We found we couldn't drink them because they were too strong : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
As a first time trip to Bali, this holiday was fantastic for the whole family,great location, Excellent buffet breakfast, we had adjoining rooms to our 13 & 15 year olds who also were impressed : [u'amenities', u'patio']
and it was always a pleasure to return to the peaceful surroundings : []
We choosed the hotel following recommendation on tripadvisor : []
the guest relations manager deisy was lovely and so accomodating : []
A bit of walking backwards and forwards entailed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are plenty of cheap and tasty dining options around the area if you jump in a taxi : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The location is so overwhelming with the beach and all the other resorts : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We got a glass of champagne each on arrival as a honeymoon couple and this helped us settle in : []
Personally I would only stay in nusa dua to relax after a trip in bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We stayed at this hotel for 5 days whilst travelling back from a month long tour of New Zealand : []
Money can b exchanged at the hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I would recommend it highly : []
View wasn't too bad either (garden view) : [u'room-experience', u'view']
the hotel is elegant and tranquil for couple of nights we spent there at the end of our holiday : []
Would stay there again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The service personnel at Nusa Dua Beach Resort - without exception - right from the person who greeted us at Denpasar Airport, were phenomenal, and were extremely attentive to our needs : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I nearly cried when we checked in : [u'amenities', u'patio']
You may not even notice them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
After my seventh stay in a Club Palace room I still love this hotel : []
I loved staying in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel; it was absolutely charming- Wonderful views, wonderful location (right by the beach), and amazing facilities for adults as well as for the children : []
Food was beautiful as was the spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The only downside is the size of the bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
The gardens and pools are beautiful and the beach was better than we expected : []
Yes we have already made the reservation! : []
Overall a very good experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food & drinks served almost all the day if you are staying at the palace club : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is clean and the restaurants, pools, gardens etc are all top notch : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
So nice to be able to sit in the open and enjoy the lovely surroundings while dining : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet', u'patio']
Great restaurants with a great atmosphere at a fraction of the cost : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
What 2 beautiful lovely ladies : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
People were walking around and looking for their own tables instead of being lead to their tables, I am unsure if they are short staffed : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Lots of seats : [u'room', u'furniture']
Lovely place for a lazy relaxing holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Am aware of the gated nature of Nusa Dua, unfortunately has a negative impact on finding the real Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We attended the hotel's yoga class one morning : []
A couple of small things wrong and fixed within minutes with no excuses, many others should learn from this attitude : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hot food was dry and awful - a couple things were ok such as the oysters and fish sticks : [u'food-beverages', u'meal', u'amenities', u'pool']
When our Butler opened the door to our room (which was more like a suite) we were so delighted to see the fantastic room we had : []
We were looking for a hotel with a quiet but nice ambience while in the same time offers a private beach and a 5-star service and this hotel fits the bill : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It was incredibly annoying! : []
below average : [u'location', u'sea']
We also did a few excursions while in Bali : []
So, we went to the shopping center two miles away for most meals : []
Not good at all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Service was ok but not outstanding : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Loved: The lagoon pool, incredible breakfasts, impreccable service and the most friendly staff with a 'nothing's a problem' attitude - always! Great food, great room, great location - and gorgeous beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
they won't bother you again : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Stayed here for 8 nights with Family, 2 adults & 2 children : [u'overall', u'culture']
Better of getting a metre taxi for 15000 : []
THe kids club staff were very friendly and the range of activities was varied : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Both the kids club and the playground (which are not close together) need an upgrade, but apart from that we enjoyed our stay : []
Also, the food was not noteworthy : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
$140Aus for a large, very clean and comfortable room with a lovely view : [u'room-experience', u'view']
as we had a 9am flight, the hotel assured us of an early opening of the breakfast buffet and also made available for us an airport transfer : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Me and my husband stayed at this hotel for a week during our honeymoon in may 2009 : [u'overall', u'culture']
This was our second stay at NDB for 2 nights in a Palace Suite : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As last year, sweet complimentary placed in our room : [u'location', u'sea']
There is no shuttle bus in the hotel and nusa dua area, except a shuttle to Bali Collection, which runs every 1 hour till 10pm : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Don't waste your time looking for other hotels, this great resort is not expensive and it offers top quality accomodation in Paradise ! : []
The food provided at the restaurants and room service is tasty and plenty of choice even for the kids : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
We stayed here with my family(son and grand daughter) : []
There is nothing but hotels and although the hotel is lovely we prefer eating in other resaurants and doing shopping : []
Average experience : [u'location', u'sea']
Overall, I enjoyed this facility much more, but of course it was much more expensive : []
After staying in the other hotels in Seminyak, Ubud and Kuta I was reluctant to go to Nusa Dua as it seems like there are just mega resorts everywhere (which is true) however this was the only place I stayed where I felt a cool breeze come through in the afternoon and through the night which is great at that time of the year : [u'amenities', u'conference']
My one and only gripe would have to be the Wednesday night general mangers cocktail party which all of the Palace Club guests are invited to meet with the GM and meet other guests : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Last but not least was the Spa massages and the honest and unique hospitality of all the Staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Although this hotel is def : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We had to walk out, then get down on the beach and have a walk along before selecting where to eat : []
We had a direct access to the beach and were 20 meters from the main pool : []
No other complaints we had a wonderful relaxing stay : []
Free child care for kids 3 and up : [u'overall', u'culture']
We have stayed in two rooms at 3rd floor (quite far from the beach) We found a solid 5 star resort where all the basic needs are there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
He is also an active Rotarian and they meet weekly in the hotel! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The staff were always helpful and nothing was too much trouble : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We went to Bali for our first wedding anniversary : []
Lobby area has awesome fishes my kid totally enjoyed it : []
Beach was clean and quiet, perfect for getaway : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Can't seem to stop people holding the sun lounges but as we were out there early and stayed there, it didn't seem to bother us but gave us something to watch when people either came back or trying to find one : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We decided to treat ourselves to a Palace Room and were thrilled with the room and value the Palace Club offers you : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The cost of a taxi arranged by the hotel is significantly more than if you organise one yourself : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We saved quite a bit of money that way : []
The wedding itself, was very well organised and took place in a marble floored gazebo overlooking the beach, which had been decorated absolutely beautifully : [u'amenities', u'conference']
But this was of minor concern : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However I got a much quieter room with much better location after I called the frontdesk : []
Breakfast was great with plenty of selections : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
This was exceptional! So tender, did not need a knife at all! The flavour was amazing! The seafood curry at Chess is another recommendation : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Tennis court was nice as well : []
Only few steps away from balcony, it would be the best room i ever stayed : []
They didn't pay for the kids club meal : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
If you are looking for night life and entertainment, the Nusa Dua beach, where this hotel is, is certainly not the place for you, and you should head to Kuta beach; personally I wanted to relax and I enjoyed my stay at this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Hope I can return for another significant birthday in 10 years time! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would completely recommend this hotel for a wedding, great value, beautiful location and exceptional service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Last tip, if like me you enjoy copious amounts of wine, south east asia is not for you, especially Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Spa, pools, beach, sports options, restaurants, grounds, rooms all met expectations : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Located in Nusa Dua far from the rustle and hustle of the city : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'bike-ride']
Flying half the way round the world to spend 2 weeks with lots of posing silicone enhanced sunbathers in what is really nothing more than a disneyworld of a hotel is not for me, but our travel agent sold it to us as part of a larger package : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
You need to rely on the taxis to go to the town, which cost you 80,000 rupiah return (although found out later that we could have negotiated for less : []
The bathrooms are nice, but there is a problem with the tile work as it was not considered utility wise, aesthetically beautiful but functionally it creates an unpleasant experience : []
We found our rooms (mine and my parents) flooded! : []
I stayed there for 9 nights and on their defence maybe my expectations were too high : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
we have returned here for 30 years and love the gentle traditional balinese hospitality and facilities at this hotel : []
The lobby is beautiful but being non Air conditioned, it can get a little hot and humid : []
He fell down headfirst to the ground from the 50-70cm tall crib : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Chairs just had towels and no people : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens', u'bathrobe', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
My husband and I stayed in the palace lounge rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
This hotel is fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Great resort, if you find anything significant to moan about here you must be hard to please : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All in all it was ok but it wasnt great : []
The resort provides transportation to and from the local area and always readily available when required : [u'amenities', u'pool']

The buffet breakfast was delightful and plenty of selections : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We also loved the walking track that connects all the resorts : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were very : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Massages at the spa fantastic! : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
In theory this is a lovely idea but for us personally, in all the times I have stayed at NDBH the manager has never come over to introduce himself which I found a little odd as we stayed over 10 times at this resort : []
The beach is nothing to boast about, it's very clean and quiet (hardly a wave), but it's good to relax by the beach or walk around the shallow lagoons : []
Good food and we also had great service from Erika, a charming and friendly young lady : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
I feel if the hotel staff can get over this communication problem at the arrival dept and rectify the problem with bathrooms, it will make this hotel a great place for the perfect holiyday : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It cost us just under 70 000R to be dropped off at the Centro Mall : []
We also kept forgetting to add the extra 21% tax, so usually ended up with a higher bill than expected : []
but this place is extraordinary : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This was our only issue though : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was large and comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
- Visit Jimbaran ( it is close to the hotel) at sunset time for great seafood and wonderful ocean landscape : []
It does rain more than Seminyak, but we didnt care : []
There were also lots of fresh juices, meats, fruit and yoghurt : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel was simply beautiful! It was in a nice, quiet part of Bali, and is just a fantastic hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Some areas a bit tired and there was some impact from building works near the pool but overall experience was very positive : [u'overall', u'feel']
all people try always to comfort your life : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
the staff were friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It would not be my first choice of places to stay on personal travel : []
Yes, I am aware there is baby-sitting facilities for a charge : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Happy Staff = Happy Guests : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
there are four pools some for little ones some for adults only near the spa : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Great facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The water sports centre is a few km down path to hotel : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Loved it and will be returning again : []
We resisted returning to the Melia Nusa Dua this year having read the recent reviews, which suggested a slip in standards : [u'amenities', u'conference']
All meals at hotel were excellent, the themed nights were great, especially the seafood bbq one : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
My husband and I stayed at this wonderful hotel for 8 nights, we upgraded to the Palace Club which we highly recommend doing, the service was excellent and the staff could not do enough for you, the room was marvelious, the grounds wonderful, squirrels, roam free and are lovely to watch : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Would recommend!! : []
Well worth the extra few dollars : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
if you are after a safe reliable spot in Bali Nusa Dua is great, If you are looking for culture, adventure and embracing something different, : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We went to the Nusa Dua area because it was the end of a long trip after Hong Kong and Bangkok and wanted low stress and quiet : []
The hotel has outstanding restaurants, a nice theater and very friendly staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our room (superior) was decently furnished and equiped - very comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
There is so much to do there that you don't feel like going out of the hotel and explore the city : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nestled amongst other big brand name hotels, the NDBH stands out for its Balinese architecture and ambience : []
Stayed during Chinese new year, utilized vouchers that were won : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were a family of 4 and we had an absolutely beautiful stay in your resort, the pools were devine, beach awesome, spa treatments and tranquillity of this hotel makes it an outstanding place to stay! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Everything is presented beautifully and exceedingly generous : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You can't beat the facilities and the many breakfasts choices, had a Spa, Sauna and Massage everyday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
very special : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Was a somewhat disappointing our evening dining bills increased accordinly : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We took the upgrade and stayed in the Palace suites : []
I would rate this facility 9 : []
Our room was gorgeous : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The hotel however also has a small 25m Lap Pool which is available until 10pm, no under 12s allowed in this area too : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Awsome breakfast with an enormous variety of food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
For example, I requested a stroller, and that was delivered to my room in 5 minutes : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Breakfasts are really great but the rest of the food became a bit 'samey' after 10 days despite there being a few restaurants on site : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The room was nice and comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
There were definitely some good points about the hotel, but there were some things that left a lot to be desired : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
WOW just got back from Bali , Nusa Dua Beach and Spa Hotel and have to say what a great holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great variety of restaurants also available in Nusa dua area : [u'location', u'general']
Wireless internet is only available in the Lobby, which was annoying - pls extend this to the rooms! The business centre had computers but was heavily utilized so didn't get a chance to use them : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We were a little doubtful having never done this before but oh my god how wrong could we have been : []
Value for money was excellent : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel is right next to a beautiful beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The balconies are huge, the bathrooms small but functional : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Highlight is the private beach where you can catch the sunrise : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
) Although experienced hikers, we wouldn't have had half the fun without one : []
the water aerobics was fun and the overall staff attentiveness was exceptional : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The bellboy took our luggage along with us to our room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
They are surrounded by restaurants and one pool has a bar : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
You'd better go to Bali collection with the shuttle or taxi : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff serving breakfast are friendly, but not attentive -- they should have cleaned the table and change the tableware and tablecloth before next batch of customers are served proactively : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Perhaps because the hotel had a low occupancy we found the food quality generally poor - stale seafood, dry chicken, poor quality steak, etc : []
Not good enough Wont be back that's for sure : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
At other times it is lovely : []
Generally good hotel, probably would stay here again, but value for money could be seriously enhanced with a few small adjustments by management that would not cost much, such as Internet access : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
make sure to confirm the benefit that comes with your room otherwise you'll end up paying for or denied your benefits : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Customer service were hugely supportive and arranged alternative rooms quickly and efficiently : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The pools suited our young kids (5&6) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We would recommend this hotel to all of our family and friends : []
Was a very pleasent stay, below are extracts of my visit: : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
There is a FREE shuttle bus that collects you from your hotel to take you to Bali Collection Shopping (Outdoor) Centre which also has restuarants and a mini supermarket : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Many staff have worked here for many years (one of my therapists told me she had been there for 20 years) which is also a testament to their ethos & how they care for their staff : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
if you scratch and 'win' you will be hoaxed to a selling session of timeshare! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In July 2011 we stayed in the Nusa Dua Hotel for the 4th time : []
I had nothing to complaint for Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
We did report to housekeeping and duty managers : []
There was a problem with the bedding in our room when we arrived but it was sorted promptly without any fuss : []
The size of swimming pools are decent : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Location was fantastic along with the service provided by staff : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
A great hotel and location for a relaxing holiday for your extended family and friends : [u'overall', u'culture']
And finally I'm wondering that they still use roomkeys instead the : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The room we have ordered was premier I think but some how it got upgraded to Deluxe for three by the Hotel Manager : []
The people working at the palace club are very, very friendly and threath youn like you are royal : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We were disappointed with our initial room (I'd say 2 star)at this hotel and felt bad to complain as the staff were so lovely : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
On our last Day I had pre booked our complimentary airport transfer and then the Palace lounge staff then re confirmed that this was all booked, however when we went to reception to leave no car had been booked but luckily for us the hotel car was there and a fantastic young chap that had only been with the hotel a couple of months drove us to the airport and out of all of the staff I would say he was one of the friendliest : [u'overall', u'culture']
The Pool staff see other inconsiderate guests leave the pool area without returning their towels but don't get off their backsides and collect them and consequently guests don't know if lounges are being used : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
This hotel is perfect to spend your stay and relax : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This gave us the opportunity to see a lot with my mum still feeling comfortable and with no stresses what so ever : [u'overall', u'culture']
Nusa Dua is still my favorite beach area on Bali, despite some liking Legian : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We stayed in a Palace Suite and were very spoilt : []
Breakfast had a wide variety of choices : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Swimming pool was large and always so many people there but for alternative we can go to the beach for kayaking, snorkling or any other beach activities, but (again) its quite expensive : []
They had a western corner offering about 6 dishes, Asian corner also 6 dishes : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel staff is excellent and verry kind : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Diving is really good in Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling']
I think this should be included as with most hotels these days : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Loved it can't wait to come back in June : []
I spoke with many guests during my stay and they also found the same thing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Having had our honeymoon in Bali 30 years ago we decided to return and so glad we chose the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
We were able to check-in before the normal time which was great after a night trip to Bali : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Just a little South of the Melia resort is a side street with a small strip of local traders with everything from drinks, to cheap eats and clothing : [u'location', u'general']
Our stay at Nusa Dua Beach & Spa Hotel was perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Lots of commotion to take an order : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms a bit aged but resort is beautiful : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
One thing that I wish to highlight from this hotels is the service standard does not meet a 5 stars hotel that I expected : []
We bought our holiday through a 'Luxury Escapes' package, for which our value for money cannot be faulted : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Breakfast was a large spread and quite good, with lots of fresh local fruit and various other options to cater for different tastes and cultures : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
One particular experience that made this hotel stand out is when I left some belongings in the hotel after checking out : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I will definitely go back for a weekend getaway to relax : []
The Balinese Restaurant at the hotel was superb : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Westin actually does a guided run at 7:30 am so if you find your way there, that's a big help: they have a mapped-out 5K or 8K loop they will show you--then you can do it on your own earlier in the morning when it's cooler : []
Beautiful resort with amazing beach front and great location : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The room was decorated in a Balinese style which appealed to us at the time of booking as we wanted to stay in a room that reflected bali rather than a more modern type of hotel room that you see anywhere in the world : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The massages are also great (try the four hands massage) : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Despite the recent travel advisories, we never had any concerns about our safety at any time during our stay : []
The pools were clean with plenty of sun-beds : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The luggage boy was very sorry and asked us to wait in the kids room while they are cleaning the room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The hotel would be very different at peak season we believe : []
Had lunch at their cafe by the beach and got served by 3 different waiters, none could understand what we ordered (it wasn't like we wanted them to cook something special for us, we just pointed at two things on the menu and they still got them wrong : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However, once we checked in, I found that there were a dirt and stain in the bed linen : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
All the staff were amazing : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Great place for a family vacation or if you are a solo traveller : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
it surpassed my expectations : []
It was not marked chargeable on 'Lunch' : []
breakfast, afternoon high tea, cocktails & canapes were served at the club lounge out on the patio each day/evening (four rooms down from our room) which was excellent : [u'amenities', u'conference']
While the spa looked good, we actually opted to use the Westin next door for a Balinese massage beach-side : []
Read my lips - IMPROVISE and show some INITIATIVE!!!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
All these functions are served by Butlers or to us commoners waiters/ress : []
In keeping with the "no building higher than the tallest palm tree", the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is a series of cottage type rooms joined together and spread throughout the property : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
so our supposed pleasant stay ended with dismay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff are lovely , the food is amazing , the drinks are ice cold and the grounds and rooms fantastic , we will be returning to this awesome hotel : []
Beautiful authentic Balinese hotel : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Only 2 improvement points are that the FOH staff need to explain all the great facilities available to guests-like the jacuzzi, free shuttle etc on arrival and the theme dance/dinners need a synopsis at the start : []
Had a couple of massages at the spa both good : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My only complaint would be the cost of food and drinks in all honesty ridiculous a small bottle of water was $4 : [u'amenities', u'pool']
So, this hotel is good place to stay with kids and parents : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Be back early next year : [u'location', u'sea']
With in no time we were shown are room (delux) which was decorated well, clean and large; the firts thing I did was check the bed sheets for dampness - dry, crisp and changed regulary : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Having been to Bali 4 times I wouldn't stay here again though it is a very beautiful place : []
They only got indoor for food and sleep : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The attention to detail is extraordinary throughout the whole resort : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
You may have a balcony close to another room's balcony : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The ambiance of the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa, the available free and user pays facilities, the cleanliness of the whole venue and the genuine friendliness of all the staff we encountered, from gardeners, security staff, restaurant staff, in fact the whole team made our stay nothing short of magnificent : [u'location', u'sea']
So no traditional Balinese village, people etc : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
There was a slight musty smell when you first opened the door to the room, but then it quickly dissapated : []
Hotel: The hotel had wonderful surrounds, the exclusive beach was great, and we were not hassled by anyone wanting to sell us anything : []
But we needn't have worried! Our kids love the pools and met some lovely friends : []
Will surely comeback here! The value for the services, rooms and ambiance is worth it : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Overall we were pretty disappointed with the experience, though we had a nice time, we would steer clear of this hotel again : []
An excellent hotel that was not too expensive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The path is covered in sand for about 100 metres, which makes it a hard slog with a stroller, but then the restaurant is just past Club Med (i : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We were not overly impressed by the quality of the food and a soft drink or a water was almost $5AUD with tax and service : []
Staff are a major drawcard especially in the food & beverage outlets : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I asked to be massaged on the little hut at the end of a pier thingy (sorry do not know technical term) it only accomodates 1 person or a couple and you feel like you are in the middle of the ocean, the massage was extraordinary and a bargain price : [u'amenities', u'gym']
It could become an addiction :-) : []
You MUST try the spa there!! it was so nice and relaxing!! I wish I chose the longer session instead of the one or 1 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The location was excellent, on the seashore, and rhe amenities were really great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The gym is very clean and has up to date equipment : [u'amenities', u'gym']
I can't stress enough how amazing this place is and how quickly we would come back if we could : []
We opted to upgrade from the deluxe to the premier rooms and unfortunately we were far from impressed : []
The hotel lobby is ornate with wood and stone carvings and a large : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
One of the best breakfast buffet's I've had : []
Like I said, we were there for CNY, but never had a problem with resturants, spa or beach loungers : []
Other travellers, including one who is a syndicated travel writer admitted to this being their favourite hotel in Bali, and we understood why : []
The Spa is sensational and good value for resort standards : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Not to mention the spread at breakfast - the omlettes are surperb : []
Not close to other shops or restaurants, but a super easy and relaxing experience : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The resort will remind you, you are in Bali every time you wake up : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
i will be back : []
The next night we upgraded to a Family room, definately recommend if you have children : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Be careful when you order room service though : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The crew were ok but perhaps cos its a big hotel then they were too busy to get along with guest : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Having travelled to Bali on many occasions, I am done rushing around in the heat from shop to shop to try and find bargains : []
This was a nice hotel with good helpful staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The dinner experience (by the beach) at Chess was one of the highlights of my stay : [u'overall', u'feel']
The staff were effecient but lacked the sweet disposition of most people you meet in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Unfortunately, that was probably our worst memory of that wonderful trip (we ended up not enjoying being in Bali despite the beauty of the island) : []
Theme nights with buffet dinner, get in early and top your plate up because they usually run out of food within the first hour : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel is big enough that you can see people when you want to : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Never feels bored and always full of excitement : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I don't normally write reviews but I felt compelled to praise Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for giving us the most amazing honeymoon : []
I should pay it by USD instead of IDR : []
It was the second time I went there, my memories were good and have been confirmed also this time : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Everything about this hotel is5 star,the staff, service,facility's etc,a few people complaining about the price of taxis from the hotel,yes there is a big difference in price,but consider this, you walk outside of the hotel save a couple of dollars and you may be getting into an uninsured and or unlicensed taxi, your staying in a 5 star hotel,why would you bother : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Kendi Kuning 600m left up the beach past Club Med is good : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Management and staff were extremely helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The location is verz : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Apart from this, it was a great choice and we'll definitely return : []
The food was good but service rather impersonal particularly given we had a 2 week stay : []
Location: The hotel is situated in Nusa Dua about 20 minute (35 minutes in traffic) taxi ride away from the main Denpasar airport : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The only bad part were the flies in the evening but the hotel did take care in spraying the sorroundings with musqito repellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I suppose I take some of the blame as I booked the room with one of the hotel aggregator websites (hotels : []
The chefs/cooks cook food well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
When I called asking them to reconfirm our flight they instead gave me the phone number : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The spa was wonderful, the ladies really know how to knead away stress : [u'overall', u'culture']
The breakfast buffet was enormous : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
we went on 2 trips with the transfer people that picked us up from the airport, we visited the areas on the way up to seeing the volcano,wood making,painting,see how the jewlery was made and others,at each of these you felt that you had to buy something as they followed you around saying "best prices for you" etc : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I think that this would also be a wonderful hotel for leisure purposes and am considering returning for a holiday some time in the future : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you are a diver then I would recommend the dive centre : []
How can be this poor hotel be a 5 stars !!! We came for 2nights & couldn't stay after 1night , lizards everywhere , path was dirty & water all over the ground : []
It's a perfect spot for a vibrant holidays : []
The bar man who served us our welcome drink, proceeded on to break a few glasses that he was clearing : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Nusa Dua is great, away from the hustle bustle but fine for day trips to the attractions : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The walk in front of the hotel down to Bali Collection is nice and shady and you get to have a look at the other hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pool/beach: very nice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Booked online and advised early check in but Hotel did not get message : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The garden, koi pond and general landscaping were manicured perfectly : [u'amenities', u'garden']
We had a family room which was quite spacious and had a great balcony to retreat to once the 6 year old went to bed : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Albeit we were in the Palace Club Suites, so got the best of everything, but nevertheless couldn't fault the service (other than on departure), amenities and most of the food : []
lovely cocktails : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Off the beach is also some reasonable coral to explore, well priced beach massage and water sports available too : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The beaches are nice but leave the bogey board at home since the waves break way out : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub']
But overall considering the package we got it was a lovely relaxing holiday : []
The games room was great but is so much further away from : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
And of course there is the attentive and friendly staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Very close to Bali collection if you want some restaurants or to do a little bit of shopping : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Looking forward to returning in the near future : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Now a warning - I went by myself to jet ski which is offered through the hotel but done through an off site company : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in January with my Mum : []
And own the private beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
but our favorite was the breakfast : [u'overall', u'culture']
A few minutes walk to the beach, and delicious food : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The beach was not crowded and hawkers were at a minimum : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Staff are so lovely - Alit was a standout for service and personal attention : [u'overall', u'culture']
We booked this hotel for 9 days and had the most wonderful time, by the pool and beach : []
Stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 3 : []
you won't be dissappointed! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Although February is rainy season we did not experience 1 day of rain, which was a blessing : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The only less than perfect thing was that the Wi-Fi was only available in the lobby area and was often slow or hard to get going : [u'amenities', u'internet']
From what I can make out from other reviews, there seems to be quite a difference in quality between the basic 'Deluxe' rooms, and the better 'Premier' rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I love everything, every corner of this hotel : []
The option of an upgrade to The Palace Club was taken where the staff were simply outstanding : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The property is very well kept it is tropical with with beautiful gardens with streams , waterfalls, ducks, squirells and the architecture is amazing : [u'amenities', u'garden']
I asked the hotel to clean my room again : []
The room was large enough to spread out, ample for all needs : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
There was a cultural performnce by some kid dancers, which was quite cute, but totally under-sold and run by totally incompetent staff : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Everything is basically a car trip to reach unless you have general fitness and don't mind the extreme heat : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We often preferred to sit at the beach which was very close to the pool area anyway : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The waiters are too busy attending to other matters and run around like headless chooks : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Due to rain this was held inside and room lacked any atmosphere : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
At the end it was sorted out but took some arguments and back and forth phone calls which were very annoying : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Also get some activities going, organised by the lazy pool staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Indulge yourself like we did and for a couple of hundred extra dollars upgrade to the Oalace Clubrooms : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Just be aware that a trip to Seminyak is one hour away by taxi (R100,000) : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Well let me tell you, it was out of this world and yes, I have travelled to many places throughout the world so feel justified in my comments : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a romantic exotic getaway and dont mind spend a little extra money for the comfort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The workout facility is adequate and they even have squash courts and tennis courts : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel was quite big with traditional architecture and ornaments which are cool : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Easy access to water sports at Nusa Dua Beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
But the food offered at the various bars and beach-side eateries was only ever fair, and overpriced in my view : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
During the course of the afternoon we were offered two more options, both being the same size as the first! We were eventually given a connecting family room for no extra cost which satisfied our needs and made up for the entire day spent waiting for a room : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The room was large and airy with spectacular views of the property : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The gym was well stocked and cold given the outside temperature : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Normally I have time at Nusa Dua at either at the end or the beginning of a holiday and find that 3 or 4 days is enough : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Bali itself was not what I expected : []
The staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bathroom is modern and has evrything one need : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
The restaurants are delicious and well priced and I love the pool and beach area; so much space but without feeling isolated : []
fantastic hotel , with long beaches , excellent rooms : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Lovely landscaped grounds and traditional architecture everywhere : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Tried all the in house restaurants - food was well prepared : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The room was a bit disappointing, the bed was very uncomfortable and the pillows smelt really bad : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of the noise level : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast is well-stocked with options for everyone and I highly recommend booking an option that includes this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Check in process smooth enough and escorted to your room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

Will come back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Infested with ants and lizards : [u'location', u'forest']
We had the most excellent time whilst celebrating my wife's birthday : []
The resort is quite a long walk from the main strip of restaurants in Nusa Dua and you will most likely be advised to take a taxi : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Right on the beach and has very good staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
When we arrived at the hotel we immediately felt very welcome and valued as guests : []
All in all well worth the money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Actually, so is the whole hotel as some places look very old and weary already : [u'location', u'general']
The therapists were excellent, but the spa/steamroom/sauna area could do with a renovation : [u'location', u'general']
In our 7th trip to Bali, we stayed for 10 days in the Palace club, and were treated like royalty in a palace!! The Palace club staff are ever present, soooo helpful with every wish, and a real asset to the hotel : []
Every evening local stalls of handicrafts sat within the hotel premises, that meant I could do all my shopping without breaking my budget or tiring my son : []
I already stayed in several 5-star holiday resorts in Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey etc : []
Our honeymoon included stays at the Shangri-La in Singapore, the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, and finally the Chedi Club in Ubud : [u'overall', u'culture']
The spa is a wonderful retreat : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
I spent a week in this amazing place for my honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
There are about 5 resturants in the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We travel with young children which isn't always easy however our stay at this hotel has always ensured that it goes as smoothly as possible : []
I agree with Sndra 88, it needed updating, but there were some parts of the resort that were under construction, so hopefully it will help : []
The spa is excellent though a little expensive : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']

Make sure you book your room with the breakfast buffet, it's definitely worth it : []
Some of the male memebers of staff could be taught a bit about personel hygiene as it could be quite offensive on the hotter days : []
Room was nice although the cleaners needed a few lessons in making a bed : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
The hotel has beautiful gardens, two swimming pools and a nice beach with enough shadowy places everywhere : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Very well maintained, amiable hotel staff, beauty of the nature, private beach, serenity and what not : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'garden', u'location', u'sea']
Walk a 100 feet to the parking lot on your left and get a cab from the cabbies waiting in the parking lot : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It has beautiful gardens and grounds, is on the seafront and has the most amazing view of the ocean : []

The hotel's restaurants and in room dining were all well priced and the food- delicious : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet', u'patio']
But, the staff is doubtfully : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Given the proximity and ease of access to offsite restaurants, spas and drivers the mark ups on resort are a little high but overall a very relaxing stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were a bit nervous as we had stayed before and loved it so were worried we had set too high return expectations : []
The pools are very well maintained and pleasant to swim in : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Its located just next to the pool and provides very good view of the hotel overall : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
hotel is located on a lovely beach which is kept clean by hotel staff, the other thing is your trapped in the resort unless you order a taxi to take you into town, if you want peace and quite and happy to lie around the pool all day than this place is fine : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The rest was very positive : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We all agreed that it is the best hotel for comfort service and ambiance : []
The food was good but obviously expensive 'cz of this being a 5 star : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There might be too many people in the breakfast room so you might better have breakfast in your room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This realy is an amzing hotel, we paid to be upgraded to the 'deluxe wing' and you really get great value for money doing this private check in, own breakfast room (with the other guests from the wing) afternoon tea included each day, all suites (ours was on the ground floor over looking the gardens and a small temple! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The whole Nusa Dua area is closed off to give a nice sense of security and seclusion : [u'location', u'general']

There were two wonderful pools with lovely casual restaurants close at hand : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']

The people of Bali are very pleasant this hotel is older but nice There are two main concerns communication and smoking : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Booked our stay direct with the hotel and opted for the Indulgence package and this proved to be exceptional value : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Definately my least favorite part of the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There is a lovely restaurant called Kendi Kuning 10 to 15 mins walk up the path to Benoa : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
All-in-all, I'd recommend this place, unless you know you'd rather have a more modern environment with less character : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Not keen on rain showerhead - large globules of water dripping everywhere : [u'amenities', u'pool']

Breakfast buffet is excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
They recommended us to a bunch of overpriced local spas where she said that she "graciously" negotiated a discount for us but we knew we had been played after our local driver took us to a MUCH higher end spa for less : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Paul & Ingeborg : []
After moaning (which isn't what you want to do after an 18 hr flight) we were moved to a slightly less dirty room : []
We found the cost of taxi services quite high : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The prices in the hotel are at least 3-fold compared to prices outside the hotel area so usually we preferred to eat outside the hotel : []

We paid 200,000 for a trip to the South, 300,000 to the West and 80,000 to the airport : []

This is far too much : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We loved the traditional balinese feel the hotel had and particularly loved the beautiful gardens and location : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Westin and Laguna seem a lot more luxurious; however with the exception of the open lobby areas and some cosmetic touches here and there, they feel like more typical luxury hotels : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Pros: lots of them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Bathroom had a tub and separate shower with a rainhead : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
So disappointment start when you're in the bed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We booked a day tour at the hotel taxi counter but we later found out that the guide who spoke to us over the phone was not the guide who was bringing us around but another assigned driver, so it was not worth the higher rate we paid for : []
The entire hotel was dark except only the reception area, we had to walk through the restaurant and some distance in dark to our room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

They have various activities for the kids and adults and we can just laze around : []
This is a very beautiful accommodation with a very nice beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the only downside is that you have to get to the beach or pool early to reserve a beach/pool bed so I do think that they need to look into getting a few more but that is just a small niggle, About 10 mins walk from the hotel is the Bali Collection a shopping complex with some nice shopping and lovely restaurants that are very cheap to eat in and the food is great, this is all to cater for the tourist so you do need to get out of your hotel and see the proper Bali, i can recommend the mountain bike trip 2 hours downhill so hardly any peddeling and you go through the bali villages and see the children, schools, paddi fields and end at the elephant sanctury this is a wonderful day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was clean and nice, the pool was also fabulous : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The only slightly negative comment I would make about the room, is that the mattress was very hard : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We stayed at this hotel in September 2014 for our Wedding Anniversary trip : []
The package does include a limited menu for Luxury Escapes but we found for the 8 nights it was sufficient the only let down was being unable to dine at the Balinese Restaurant when after we sat not realising this were told quite loudly and rudely we don't do vouchers here : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
However, the rooms themselves are old and in need of a major renovation : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
One of the most relaxing holidays I've had! : []
Because this place is set on 23 acres it didn't seem busy even thought it was fully booked most nights : []
The hotel is authentic Bali so this is suitable for people who want to stay in an authentic hotel as opposed to a western style : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
But, in general, a wonderful stay at a glorious Balinese-style hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Amazing holiday, super friendly staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Loved every moment I was there : []
Overall impression: lovely place but can be crowded, rooms need overhaul : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Breakfast the next morning was as it had always been with a buffet plus the choice of a cooked item; this was very good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Looking forward to returning : [u'amenities', u'patio']
resorts in Bali and very well maintained : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
It was, again, another example of the commitment of the hotels staff to ensure their guests are happy : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Grounds were imaculate and staff out every morning early tidying up : [u'overall', u'safety']
I strongly recommend upgrading to The Palace Club as the privacy and service was excellent : [u'room-experience', u'privacy']
We had a suite and found it to be very comfortable : []
plan to come back with the whole family to stay longer and enjoy the superb service that this hotel provides : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We also went to avail our free photo at the beach but sad to say we can't find the photographer for 2 days! That would be a great souvenir for our honeymoon : []
We discovered the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa in 2009 : []
No need in looking for something better! Everything is perfect! Would definitely visit again : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we refer to it as our second home : []
The grounds of the hotel are well maintained and the hotel facilities are of a high standard : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Actually durning palace club cocktails other visitors told us same, good service but hurry afterwods and have to fill comment card : []
The one suggestion I would have is that when you arrive find yourself a good driver and get him to take you to all the places you want : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It could be nice to get a little more information about the what to do in Bali like a day program or where to shop : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room next to us was being painted and the varnish fumes came under the adjoining door and made us feel quite poorly, when we commented on this the staff laughed at us and continued to paint! Far out : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Stayed in a premier room, with additional cot and single bed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The bars and restaurants were excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The breakfast was quite satisfactory with most of the usual menu items : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
During our visit we witnessed and took part in two releases of baby turtles, the first relocated from Kuta beach and the second from a nest on the hotels beachfront : []
Hotel itself is located on the long beach strip surrounded by several other, bigger or smaller, resorts : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Everyone was really helpful and professional : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Sometimes it takes a bit getting the message across about what you want, but then they will deliver : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
30 am and then sent a get well card, flowers and bowl of fruit to our room : []
the grounds were immaculate and welcoming : [u'overall', u'safety']
For someone who is extremely fussy I really can't fault this hotel - it was the perfect resort for a relaxing, stress free holiday in the warm sun! : []
id He is from Ubud, is totally reliable and took us through the traditional villages and back roads to avoid the appalling Bali traffic : []
Service is sublime : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Rooms are big enough with excellent decoration and beautiful outside view : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We enjoyed our stay but after such amazing expiriences in other parts of Bali (Sanur and Ubud) We were a little disheartened at first about the area : []
The rooms are clean as you might expect from a hotel this calibre : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Im currently in fiji at a resort that doesnt even come close to nusa dua style i dont normally review but thought I must as I have just realised I experienced the best off the bat and others fail to compare : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We have just returned from a 10 night stay this time and it was perfect again : []
We had a beautiful room with balcony over looking a peaceful terrace : []
Agree with other comments about Taxis so if you know precisely where you are going, ask the hotel to get you a blue cab : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during the Seclusion Day : []
They are the special people and hopefully their culture will stay intact : [u'overall', u'culture']
We stayed in this hotel 3 years ago, spent our honeymoon there and it was the perfect choice : []
I had the pleasure to spent last week at this splendid place and hotel in Bali : []
We had a superior room, which was nice and spacious enough : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Have to say it is well worth a trip just for the complimentary crackers when purchasing a drink! The nut crackers are to die for : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel provides all you need for an all-inclusive vacation in the high-end resort area of Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I will look for this deal next time I stay : []
I am returning to Bali on 29 August and cant wait to stay at : []
We spent great holidays : []
The gardens were a dream : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Our boys had a ball Jetskiing and the prices here can vary down the beach : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The burger I had from the beach front cafe was awful : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant']
The evening cocktails were great, especially given our central location : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
After an initial stumble with our previously promised room not being available , the Hotel quickly arranged for a suitable replacement room that was above expectations : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We also would not eat at the restaruant again mainly as it is far too hot the fans are totally inadequate to be of any use : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I saw more birds and animals here,inside the green area of the hotel,then in entire Bali : []
The staff are so helpful and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Nusa Dua is the place to stay if you want to be away from the real Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are several restaurants there that are very cheap and clean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My husband and I have just stayed in the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for two weeks and had a wonderful time : [u'location', u'sea']
- Onsite restaurants were a bit hit and miss particularly with service at the Italian and the international restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Happy Holidays : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But everything else is frustrating : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The grounds were extremely well maintained and so peaceful! We were in a Palace Club Room and had use of the Palace Club lounge, which was great : [u'overall', u'safety']
Just right for the little ones : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
All in all it was a good holiday : []
Hopefully we are lucky enough to return to this wonderful island with its deep cultural roots and the most friendly people you could hope to come across and we would certainly stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa having met people who come back year after year and feel very much the same : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Was better than I could of ever imagined : []
great accommodation, beautiful scenic property, magnificent pools, great breakfast choices and all and all a great experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed at the Nusa Dua for 8 nights as part of our honeymoon trip : []
Staff throughout the hotel seemed to treat thier role as just a job, the only people who were outgoing and cheerful were the housekeeping team - now if only they could pass on their cheerfulness to others : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The Hotel just need at times not to forget the little things cleaning the rooms and balconies , remembering to replace towels etc : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens', u'bathrobe', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
Awesome food, service, drinks and hospitality : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I would stay at this hotel again if I returned to Bali : []
I've read about this excellent resort hotel for the longest time and it was my dream to stay here because of the rave reviews I've been reading : []
Chief Chef, Ian - wonderful human being and so dedicated, the food is of the highest quality and deliciously nutritious! As far as PR goes, you can't go past Ian and Bruce : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The room had two sets of doors, both with locks, one glass, the other with wooden louveres : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Other than that nice resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
This hotel offers value for money compared to equally large hotels in Nusa Dua, at only $190US a night, I felt the price reflects what we got, probably just leaning on the overpriced side : []
The hotel sits in beautiful grounds, the pools and beaches lovely and our room was very pleasant, clean and well stocked with water : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Even the room service was great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
NDBH still has the Balinese feel to it so you really do feel that you are staying in a island paradise : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms are realy good though lighting could have been better : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
The staff were absolutely delightful, great service and every staff member greeted us with a lovely smile and nothing was ever too much trouble : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel more than met my expectations : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
When I arrived, I couldn't believe that the hotel was built on 1983! It looked (and felt) like its only built couple of years ago! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
All in all a lovely experience : [u'overall', u'feel']
We were staying in the palace club room, and we feel the services we got well worth the extra we paid for this type of room : []
Pools & beach are beautiful & relaxing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
You know : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So very helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If the prices were lower then more quests would enjoy the bar area rather than leaving for the other resorts : [u'amenities', u'pool']
My husband & I went there in April 2011 and stayed there for 4 days : [u'overall', u'culture']
I do not know if I would stay at this Hotel again as it was not worth the money I paid, but there is certainly potential!!! : []
On arrival we were given a room where the stench of varnish was overpowering, the connecting door was open to a room being refurbished next door : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
The atmosphere is very relaxing and the staff are great : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Wonderful a Beautiful Hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Its a very well maintained pond and restaurant and the breakfast is as usual good and tasty : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The Staff there are excellent : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
During the day everyone seems to disappear as there is an abundance of seating on the beach to match the expanse which is shaded and provides ample respite from the heat : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The location is excellent and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who simply wants a relaxing holiday : [u'amenities', u'patio']
thanks also to the manager who also provided transportation from Westin back to the hotel when i got sick : []
We found the food to be really good and enjoyed all the restaurants in the hotel : []
Staff were very helpful and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Food in resturants superb and cutural dinners were also good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We checked into our room and had a late dinner in our room before going to bed : []
Good food and service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Tours: Pacific World should be avoided- they overcharge and will try and take advantage of you : [u'overall', u'culture']
A short walk out of the resort will take you to the main streets for some cheap shopping and treatments : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
There were many restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Especially Edac (Sorry can't spell his name) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I would definitely stay again, though I would upgrade to the Palace club suites : []
For the price this is a great place in Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The places to eat at the hotel are clean and the staff and provide good service : [u'location', u'general']
Such a relaxing escape from city life and the resort met our expectations : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Fake taxis between the resort and Balli collection costs 300 IDR one way : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The prices are of course higher than outside the resorts, but not in my view unreasonably so : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Food was acceptable but not particularly great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
When we arrived our bathroom smelt like vomit : []
Enjoyed the beach jogging path as if you don't want to walk in sand this path very pleasant to walk along : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nivce place with helpful and intelligent staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Main pool has been re-tiled, etc & looks great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
It took over 24 hours for the request to be understood and put into place : []
And was very impressed from the moment we arrived to the moment we left : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Just about everything was perfect: comfortable and elegant surroundings (including the best beach-front location in the area), terrific food and numerous on-site entertainment options : [u'location', u'general']
The Chess bar was somewhere this side of heaven : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Breakfast, Afternoon Tea and evening Cocktails with Appetisers are a real treat and quite sufficient to keep you going throughout the day, if you wish : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We hired bikes a couple of times and thoroughly enjoyed riding along the coastline which I highly recommend : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The chefs and the kitchen are skilled in the cuisines of Asia and Europe and each day provided exceptional dishes : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
It was a bit quite but other than that was lovely : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very suitable for younger children : [u'overall', u'culture']
The staffs are very friendly, they always greet you & smile to the guest hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Of the three hotels, Nusa Dua was the one I was most nervous about, following some of the reviews I'd read in TripAdvisor : []
However, the hotel is your typical beach hotel - it's where you go to relax (beach is great!) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
and the funniest thing is that we paid for 2 main courses of noodles, one salad, 2 beers 60 USD dollar!!!! whereas everywhere else in Bali you eat this quantity with 20 USD! because the food cost here is too low, so it is really very high priced with no reason and poor quality of food! : []
We understand that the part of Bali we stayed is not the real Bali and rather idealistic, but as holiday makers rather than travellers, we found it beautiful, safe, luxurious and romantic : []
So it may not be the best for those who cannot walk : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Our garden view room was nicely appointed however, the bathroom was quite dated : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
We have been in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel many times and it's still Excellent every time we look to escape for holidays! : []
So if you want a good beach, look elsewhere! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Location is great : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
All the resort restaurants had extensive menus with a wide selection for all tastes and the breakfast selection is wonderful - we certainly did not go hungry : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
My family and I was visiting Bali for the first time : [u'overall', u'culture']
First the positives: : [u'amenities', u'patio']
over all a good experience : [u'overall', u'feel']
Its a short drive from the airport, and the hotel forms part of a "gated-security" area : [u'location', u'general']
This being our first experience of a Resort Hotel I think we were pleasantly surprised, : []
I inadvertently lost my book on the second last day & replacing was a huge issue as they couldn't work out what was left & told me all was basically utilised (which I knew was incorrect) however they were adamant : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The sea is on site and a wonderful pool awaits : [u'location', u'sea']
We did both and we not disappointed in either : []
) The guards were very polite and obviously had our safety in mind, but none the less, one got the feeling that we were being isolated somewhat from the rest of the island : []
My husband and I were travelling with our 2 young children (1yo and 3yo) : [u'overall', u'culture']
We had booked half board, and you can use any of the restaurants for dinner : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast was included and had a lot of variety to choose from : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We had a few sumptuous lunches at the two restaurants near the pool : []
I have noticed since being here that the rooms overlooking the pools are being renovated : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I loved having a quiet dinner every evening at the Chess restaurant on the beach with the sea breeze in my face and the ocean waves at my feet! Also has a great spa, though prices are higher than the spas outside the hotel : []
Our room was very clean and comfortable, the only thing we disliked was the lack of sound insulation from the bathroom : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We enjoyed relaxing there for the duration on our holiday : []
That's the ONLY good thing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed in the Palace Club with was amazing and definitely worth the upgrade : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
For example, I was accidentally charged for a dinner when it was covered with a pre-paid voucher : []
I stayed 2 nights here with 2 friends - we had a splendid time : []
It really makes a difference to wake up in the morning and see the beach ;) Rooms are spacious and comfy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I stayed here for 8 days in November, good resort for chilling out : []
There is also excellent security, we felt very safe : []
The rooms were reasonably sized and very well maintained, we never had any problems throughout our stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We have spent several holidays in the Palace Club and after trying a couple of other hotels, have once again returned to the Palace Club : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
If you come here on a rainy season (December, January) be ready to experience lots of rain, but it will not bother you - especially in Nusa Dua Beach - since there's too much to admire, you breath is taken away by the beauty of the hotel and the island - and you simply do not notice there's extra water coming from above : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Room was nicely furnished and cleaned well, recreational facilities and activitiies were great and the Kecak dance and buffet dinner on the beach (Sunday evenings) is highly recommended : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Even breakfast was just ok minus the fruit, which is weird to say about a buffet : [u'amenities', u'conference']
have nothing but praise for very professional and friendly staff and management : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
Staff were very friendly and acceptable for this hotel (probably 4 star now) and made you feel welcomed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The children's outdoor park/climbing equipment was not there a Key feature of why I had booked this hotel, and the spa treatment was filled with the sounds of drills for 3 hours : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
Just had a week ( first time to Bali) and thought both the country and the resort were spectacular holiday destinations : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
simply too high : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
During Monday to friday is so quite and relaxing : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
THe staff in general were polite, helpful and welcoming : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
However, some staff was not as helpful and resourceful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The food and service was once again a very pleasing part of our stay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Rooms, service and staff very impressive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to stay in Nusa Dua : [u'amenities', u'patio']
go there) and shopping : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
More on this at the end : [u'location', u'sea']
Is it realy possible? : []
There are numerous restaurants in the area and they will all pick you up from the hotel and drop you home : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The Balinese architecture is found within the temple providing a sense of location and respect of traditional culture : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The front text greets you with a nice towel to refresh yourself from the humid air : [u'amenities', u'internet']
It is always a relaxing stay and it always feels sad to leave! : []
The gym staff are amazing and have a wealth of knowledge and experience in all sports - I can now skip a double under because of them! And I love to relax in the spa after : []
Did like the pool-bar though! Our family room was really big - the girls shared a bunk bed in a separate room to ours : []
Breakfast is very good with lots of choice and in a beautiful setting : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
In the afternoon there is high tea with cakes, sandwishes and evening has cocktails with some yummy food : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
you first have to differentiate between the hotel and the rest of the island : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beach clean and quite, pool area excellent, Chess restaurant service and food fantastic : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food at the hotel was a mixed bag -- breakfasts were large, lots of variety, and quite good overall; the one dinner we ate at the hotel, at the sushi restaurant, was mediocre and expensive -- there are much more interesting (and less pricey) restaurants outside the hotel in any event : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Hotel itself was very clean & well maintained : []
Nice strolling grounds and overall a beautiful place : [u'overall', u'safety']
and compared to meals and drinks outside the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I know that they have done renovations but I don't think it makes the rooms an extra $86 per night, but this is only my opinion : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we did not have access to the palace lounge as we paid suck a low rate for the upgrade which i was disappointed about but soon got over it! the room was very clean with a turn down service every night : []
Grounds are very clean, neat n tidy : [u'overall', u'safety']
We spent 9 nights here last year in a Palace Club Suite and loved it, so when it came to booking somewhere special for our 20th Wedding Anniversary - this was our first choice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I am normally really fussy about accommodation (particularly cleanliness) but loved this; maybe a bit olde worlde Balinese'e in some rooms but I like this : []
The spa was very expensive too, so we ended up catching a 3min taxi ride to local shops for our spa treatments : []
Not much to think about each day except what to eat from the extensive breakfast buffet, to which pool to lounge at : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room was tired and the balcony wooden rail was hanging off so not safe : []
Booked a couple of tours in Nusa Dua which was much less than the advertised price in the brochure and almost certainly far less than what you would pay if booked directly through the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Fantastic trip with the family : [u'overall', u'culture']
My husband and I spent an amazing vacation, and have excellent customer service from all the staff at the Nusa Dua beach Hotel & Spa, especially from the all restaurant staff which lead by Mrs : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They restaurants on resort are more expensive, but they are beautiful and one offers entertainment on certain nights : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Overall a wonderful place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Highly recommend to families and couples looking to relax : [u'overall', u'culture']
We caught taxis into Kuta every day to eat / shop (don't do it in Nusa Dua), then went on to stay in Ubud : []
We cannot recommend this hotel enough trust me you will NOT be disappointed and like us you will make this your home away from home : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is totally safe and accommodated for my needs! cant wait to go back this month :) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There were cute squirrels running around and they love to be fed pineapple : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There is a choice of restaurants to choose from for lunch and dinner and the loungebar is awesome for sipping cocktails and unwinding after a long day of sighseeing or shopping : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Looking forward to returning for more relaxation in 2013 : []
A perfect location,wonderfull facilities and marvelous staff,but the chef seems to be able to destroy the beautifull ingredient used in the food preparation : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
So glad we did, it was everything we remembered and this time it was even better because we immediately knew where everything was : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
By then it was 4 : []
Our check in was smooth and foyer lovely but as soon as we started walking toward our room down the corridor I started to worry, feeling hemmed in : []
Turn-down service was a nice touch : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Anyone who went to breakfast and couldn't find something to eat must have something wrong with them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
it has the most amazing proximity to the beach and a lovely lake in they compound where there were ducks all day long and the kids loved it : [u'overall', u'culture']
Breakfast by the ponds was our highlight : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Not so positive : []
But when come back next time definetely will stay minimum 2 nights to enjoy the ambiance, pool and beach and will try the spa : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The staff couldn't do enough for us : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The chairs outside on the balcony are also dirty with mould growing on the cushion seat covers : [u'room', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'banquet']
The landscaped garden is really spectacular : [u'amenities', u'garden']
As the hotel was not busy, the main pool was enough for us : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
It's so garlicky! And its more like a garlic cracker, its certainly NOT a bread : []
There was no way that you would sit outside on your balcony and enjoy the views of the lovely gardens : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone : []
Ornate fountains both inside and outside : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Our room was very clean/comfortable and the location was quiet : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We walked around the other neighbouring resorts and we thought that this hotel has the best kept grounds and pools : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The location is both a plus and a minus depending on how you look at it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just can't fault it : []
Loved their Mixed Berry juice : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We checked into the palace rooms and on the 7 occasions we went for breakfast our order was wrong : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A turndown service is provided every night with slippers being set out beside the bed on slipper mats and a refresh of the room is done; emptying garbage, replenishing water, etc : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The breakfast buffet in the : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I went there with my son with a Turkish travel agency and we chose the hotel together : []

The staff at the hotel were so welcoming from the time we arrived to the time we left : []
This hotel is exceptional as it gives a complete service in very beautiful surroundings : []
Overall, I enjoyed my stay at your hotel and looking forward to having another magical moment in Bali : []
I would recommend a stay here once all the construction is finalised : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
the pizzeria was nice, and dinner at Raja's Balinese was lovely albeit a bit pricey but to be expected : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
We (2 adults / 2children) had a 8 night stay : [u'overall', u'culture']
We celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary staying in the Palace Club Suite : []
We have previously stayed here in 2013 and loved the service and friendliness of the so much then that we decided to return : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We were tempted to laze by this pool many times because it is so peaceful, but just never got there : []
believe me - there is such a huge difference, and if you can, choose the Palace Club Room!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
After having spent 5 previous visits to Bali in Kuta (Tuban) we really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere that we found here : []
If you walk or catch a Taxi out of the main gates there are lots of wonderful restaurants there which are so much cheaper than in the Nusa Dua area : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The place is dusty, dirty and needs a total re-vamp : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The grounds are beautiful and the pools are huge : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Even with the major refurbishment undertaken in the last few years it has maintained its charm stylishly but not opulently : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I stayed again in Nusa Dua Beach, and it was as perfect as ever before : []
The beds were on the firmer side, but comfortable : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Can be a fairly nice hotel if you plan to travel with your kids : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It did get to be annoying the amount of people that would constantly approach you to buy local wares (anything from plactic necklaces to sarrongs) while you were trying to relax or sell you another trip snorkeling, surely there has to be a better way of doing this? I also found it a little odd that I couldnt borrow or hire a pair of fins from the hotel and was told I needed to walk down to another resort laguna and that it would then be $10 an hour just to use them??? So hense I went snokeling sans fins : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are balinese style and a little musty but goes : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
evening cocktail at the club was so so : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
-For trip and excursion -use with confidence the hotel amenities, otherwise you risk to be fooled by opportunists drivers : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staying in a palace club room is worth the extra money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Birthdays and special celebrations are never forgotten : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Breakfast provided a comprehensive choice of foods : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I have some very happy memories of my stay at Nusa Dua beach hotel : []
The food was delicious and reasonable in value but drinks were a bit expensive in the hotel compared to the restaurants down the road at the Bali Collection : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
It is a very relaxing place, where you can do as much or as little as you want : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Both very well run and good value for money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Breakfast buffet was amazing, have never seen such a variety of food and the quantity was kept up so even if you arrived towards the end of breakfast serving, there was still plenty left : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Hard to choose between the pools or the fantastic beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We went their on our Honeymoon for 5 Nights : []
With the exception of a slightly messy check in- there was little to fault : [u'amenities', u'conference']
can't think of anything that went wrong! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is not of modern design but more traditional asian : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff are only too happy to assist with everythiing, the food is delicious, the rooms are clean and well appointed and well maintained, the pools are imaculate and inviting and the spa is awesome : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Vegetarian dining options were limited but usually happy to accommodate when requested : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The breakfast needs special mention as the variety and quality is excellent in a lovely setting : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Highly recommended Sandy Brasier Harvey world Travel Mt Waverley : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']

We we found them to be as clean as other (unnamed ) 5 star hotels in Bali : []
We have just returned from 10 nights at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Palace Club, although a little more expensive, does offer value for money : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
We had a late flight out of Bali so used the spa facilities until it was time for our car to the airport : []
Would return depending on the deal we could get : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Reception and also the Transport Desk didn't seem to understand that it was an issue for us : []
This was our 4th visit to this Resort, and since on this ocassion we celebrated our wedding anniversary we decided to take the Honeymoon Package at the "Palace Club Section" : []
The spa was great and more than we expected : []
We went to the Bali Collection (lots of shops in an outside Mall) and made some purchases there but to be honest, it is about 2 or 3 times more expensive than the surrounding area because it mainly targets the tourists : []
The 2 lagoon pools are a good size with plenty of sun lounges around both pools and in front of the well manicured gardens and sandy beach, never any problems finding a sun lounge and the pool team always there to assist and offer food & beverage service : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Thanks Bruce for making us feel so welcome : []
I cannot praise the staff highly enough : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff made every effort to ensure all our needs were being taken care of : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just returned from 10 days relaxing holiday at this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
By walking around Nusa Dua on the seaside, I must say that Nusa Dua Beach hotel and resort has one of the nicest beach and especially enough loungers for all their guests : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We spent just under a week at this amazing hotel during our honeymoon : []
I had to change rooms as the shower and the fridge in my first room were not working, again trying to explain this was horrendous : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thank you for a wonderful stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We have been staying at this hotel for 16 years and it nevers fails to disappoint : []
This holiday was also to celebrate our 10 th wedding anniversary but we won't be waiting 10 years to return! : []
Food in the hotel are delicious : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
No need to tip unless you experience exceptional service (although customary to tip porters for bag handling and housekeeping) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Internet at the business centre was very expensive and slow : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The hotel is overall of very good standards, nice rooms, nice service, could not find any reason not to enjoy the holidays, I was expecting to find very good spas in Bali but this was way much better than what I expected !! : []
The hotel is beautiful, lush gardens, friendly, attentive staff and breakfast to die for! The spa pool is the perfect place to cool off and unwind - but it's great to socialise at the swim-up bar in the main pool area too : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Very glad we did not stay in this area : []
For holidays I would not recommend the hotel : []
A new statement was prepared & there was still one transaction wrong : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Value for money with different package inclusions is amazing : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
From the moment you step in front of the lobby, you are greeted with a true Balinese hospitality, and it is magical : []
The seats are still designed on the old thematic fashion of clothed seats : [u'room', u'furniture']
Stayed here as a couple for a week in May : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The bed was comfy and the bathroom was also very clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
A great resort to stay, however not if you want to experience the Indonesian feeling : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A little isolated, but free shuttle bus to the 'Bali Collection' (sterile shopping and restaurant complex, for tourists) and taxi elsewhere : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
At the end, new bed in ordinary room wins over upgraded room with old bed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
There is a nice restaurant up the beach that offers lovely food at about half the price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff is trustworthy I forgot my iPhone at the breakfast restaurant on the check out date and called them from airport; they were very helpful and tried sending it with a driver but he couldn't catch me so they kept it at their Lost & Found department till a friend of mine was in Bali and took it : []
We also enjoyed the quietness of the spa pool this trip being without the kids : []
But, you're going to Bali, aren't you? Some of the others could be Tokyo or some generic beach resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We would definitely come to this hotel again : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I booked the pool bale for just the 2 of us for a birthday celebration : []
A few things was we stayed in a private apartment which made it a lot cheaper for a family of 6 : []
Overall the hotel offers good value : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Easy to walk up the beach to other (and cheaper) restaurants : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Even after I come back 2 days later at 12 midnight, the staffs were very helpful in locating my belongings with the Lost and Found department and returned it to me in less than 10 minutes, all properly packed : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Welcome, staff, atmosphere and service is simply excellent and beyond "usual standards" : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Beautiful surroundings : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We arrived on 23rd and the receptionist told us that our room was cancelled (although we paid in advance and told them that we are there for our honeymoon) and said we had to pay it again in our own expense : []
We were made to wait 45 minutes before our room was available, and it was not at all what we wanted or expected, it was tiny and above the main driveway, we were upgraded when we told them it was not what we wanted, the upgraded room was better, but only just! The walkways to rooms always had room service trays outside the doors : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We stayed for 9 days, but could have stayed longer quite happily : []
It was a short 10 min walk to local shops and small market : []
We would return to the hotel but hopefully to a better room : []
The breakfast buffet alone was worth the price of the accommodation : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The only locals allowed within 100 yards of tourists are forced to wear numbered shirts so the aforementioned security guards can keep tracks on them - we dont want the people who live in Bali to interrupt the nice tourists now do we! : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
My husband and I went to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel as part of our honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
The fragrance of oils combined with the natural birdsong and the expertise of the therapists wiled away all the stresses of everyday life : [u'overall', u'culture']
This property is meticulously maintained and is a delight to visit : [u'room', u'furniture']
As i remember the Hotel location is perfect, great food by the pool and nice junior suites with garden : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Thank you nusa dua beach hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We booked a family deluxe room which were two inter connecting rooms : [u'amenities', u'conference']

Stayed at the Resort for a week -- great experience -- lovely beach front except of you are looking for waves you dont get them here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
nice pools etc, staff great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our group stayed in a number of different room types : [u'amenities', u'conference', u'recreation']
We loved every moment : []
Customer Service: Besides the one lady who asked us why we didn't bring our cow along (we needed fresh cartoned milk every night for our daughter), the service was lovely and always with a smile : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We arrived late and were checked in swiftly in the Palace Club area and retired after a long day of boozing and flying :) : []
My only complaint about this hotel was that it was just a bit too quiet : []
There is hourly free shuttle between hotel and Bali Collection Shopping Mall, a great place for souvenir shopping and chill out : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
We intend to return very soon, and now that we know what the people are like and what a Beautiful place Bali is, we will stay longer, : []
The staff could were so helpful and friendly which enabled us to totally relax : [u'amenities', u'conference']

I visited this hotel in Feb 2011 for my honeymoon n loved the hotel for its location : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Staff were charming, friendly, courteous and anxious to please : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Its a very relaxing place to stay and no hassle to get transport (no where in bali is) to other parts of the island : [u'location', u'sea']
I was a little disappointed in the distance we had to walk from reception to our room, but it was OK once we'd done it a few times and the view and location were worth it - we were right at the pools and restaurants, so that was great : []
Ask for a driver called John : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Hot water just warm , and the bath room door lock was stuck , lucky the engineering staff prompt coming : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We were amaze that the hotel was given us beyond our expectation *again* : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
i wanted to open the doors to let some air in but the air conditioning automatically turns off so that wasn't an option : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The service was faultless and the staff were lovely as they could not do enough for you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Idid have some trouble with service on one day but believe it or not it was not a local but a foreigner who could not get the service correct : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
In Nusa Dua for sure you can find hotels with more modern setup, but after : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms a good size : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Catch the free shuttle bus to the Bali-Connection and stock up in the markets (there are 3 but the prices are the same); only one has wine/spirits : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We walk to some other hotel/resort along the beach too : []
The hotel arranged driver was 700,000 to Ubud : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
But nothing beats the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa dua is just far enough away from kuta , no harassment !! Good shopping , lots of bargains : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Can't recommend highly enough : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I had to stay at the Laguna Bay on business for one night and that seemed very similar too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was a nice hotel in a Balinese style : []
the food and drinks were expensive but i guess that's the price you pay for staying in a 5* hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff was very friendly,helpful and professional : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had an absolutely fabulous, relaxing time : []
Terima kasih!! : []
We met guests there who had stayed on 7 or 8 occasions, they love it : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We were escorted to our suite - what a gorgeous one it was : []
however, the bathroom was very tiny : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Truly balinese touch throughout the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The breakfast is INCREDIBLE : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I saw several incidents of 'lounger rage' and is an area I feel the hotel could clamp down on - people putting towels down and not using the beds till mid afternoon or so and is selfish in my opinion : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The themed nights were a good way of seeing some of the local culture : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The swim up bar was a treat and the food and drinks were very cheap and first class : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Food delicious, staff attentive, room clean, quiet and functional : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
We Will definitely be returning : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
What I liked most this time was the jewelry course at the hotel : [u'location', u'sea']
Entire hotel and grounds kept very clean : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Bar & eateries were delicious and service was quick : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
the pool is amazing and one of the best in bali : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']

The food at the restaurants was fresh and prepared well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The Resident Manager (Mr Peter Scholz) made himself available to us at all hours of the day and night, and the Palace Club Team were so amazing in their care and concern for our friend, and also for my husband and my welfare : [u'location', u'sea']
There are so many activities to keep all age group busy : [u'amenities', u'conference', u'recreation']
One 2 room suite for us and a connecting 2 room suite for the kids with a large balconey looking into the centre of the resort : []
Great staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
That said, it is not exactly my cup of tea : []
I genuinely love everything about this hotel! : []
The most glaring problem of the place is that there is no communication between departments, if the matter is not handled by the person on the phone, he/she will just ask you to call the relevant party, or on 2 occasions, mumbled ok/yes and then completely forgotten about it : []
00 AUD wich entitled us to a $150 : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
Everything is beautiful and quite expensive BUT out the back door is a different story : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also we fly with Garuda /business class they just get better everytime highly recommend them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Thanks to the management : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
-Starting with breakfast experience, in a wonderful garden ( just Palace Club rooms) , with helpful staff and good food : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We were shown another room which was exactly the same and were told our only option was to upgrade to a Palace Club Suite for an extra $100 a night : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
However, culturally it was pretty much nothing and you are pretty isolated from Bali in general : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are many well organized fun sporting activities to join in with : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We arrived at 8 in the morning for a meeting and our room was availble for us : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The last time we were at this hotel was May 2011 and will go back for lunch this May : [u'location', u'sea']
Otherwise it was a great stay and will go again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We could not have been more impressed : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
you get wayu beef, so tender & juicy, among other meats which you cook on your own BBQ stove : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Lived up to expectations ,only one small complaint toilet exhaust fan not working, poolside service good ,we found the food very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
But from then on everything was smooth : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Touching our food with their fingers, not very hygienic : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
My husband and I stay 4 nights at this Hotel during our Bali vacation : [u'overall', u'culture']
This is a spectacular hotel set in beautiful gardens : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We stayed in this wonderful hotel in March 2014 for 9 nights after 4 nights in Singapore : []
Nanny service was very good and reasonably priced : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Once you haggle, there is no way out; they let you know it in the local dialect as well as obvious hand gestures if you decide that sailing through a storm might not be the best way to see corals : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Benefits of upgrading to the Palace Club were seperate check in at their lounge area (which is exclusively for the use of Palace club guests), breakfast served in the lounge area (with a lovely view overlooking the gardens) also included in the price was afternoon tea & cakes (We did not try these), soft drinks all day and evening cocktails between 6pm - 8pm, if you didnt want cocktails you could have beer / wine etc as an alternative : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
NDBH met all these needs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We cannot comment yet as to whether there are good restaurants out of the resort precinct that are easily accessible, which may be an option if wanting to spend less on food or drinks, however, in saying that, this minor critique has not in any way dampened our holiday or diminished the quality of our stay here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We enjoyed all that the resort offered especially the New Years buffet dinner and show : [u'amenities', u'pool']
This room was awesome : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Could hear the neighbours talking : [u'amenities', u'elevator']
Back to the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
not cheap but really value for your money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The restaurants have lovely food (not a fan of the Italian pizza restaurant sadly), but make sure you eat outside as well : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were very friendly and accommodating : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Rajahs restaurant was a great experience, not only for the wonderful Balinese food but also for the ambience and service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
One of the best things about the hotel is the staff who were all lovely : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Room service is satisfactory, no trolleys but they leave you with the trays : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
It was just a nice gesture to let us in even we were 5 hours too early from the allowable check in time : []
Computer with free internet is included : [u'amenities', u'internet']
I don't agree with previous reviews that you are forced to eat at the expensive restaurants : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And this hotel had the best and most consistent reviews for a good reason - it really is that good : []
Repeat, you do not want to go into Kuta, it will spoil whatever beautiful Bali that is still preserved : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel adds 21% tax and service to all food and drinks which is pretty strandard but when the prices are high to start with the tab gets pretty large pretty quickly : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
want to move to nusa dua beach hotel because I'm trapped in ayodya now : []
The most beautiful garden in all Nusa Dua specially when you do a tour with the Garden Manager! An other fantastic experience was the Fruit Carving with an experienced Chef that above all is a true artist : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had rose petals on bed and in the run bath upon arrival which was a nice touch : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It was a little slow, however available if needed : []
The beach was just about OK : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
I will add to this later but wanted to share with people : []
Especially with the room that is located so close to breakfast, pool, and beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
beautiful balinese decor is awe inspiring : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
LOVELY LOVELY people : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A special mention to the staff at the customer relations desk in the lobby : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
-The room is on the ground, with acces to excellent garden; sometimes we received fruits in the room : []
The WiFi is available all round the resort except in the rooms unless you pay I never felt the need to have it in my room as I was on holiday : []
( this would be our 54th trip to Bali so I have been to many resorts) : []
The breakfast is just awesome, the beach front nice and many recliners to sit and sunbathe on : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It takes the gloss off an overall charming resort : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The buffet dinners - we went to all 3 - are not only good value for money, but beautifully presented with wonderful entertainment : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We actually really enjoyed it - the location is nice and the hotel has lots of facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
For racquets, but we couldn't use the resort credit we were given : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Having stayed in a number of hotels in Nusa Dua and Benoa we were not sure what to expect when we selected The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa although they were high and the hotel did not disappoint : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The PH of the pool was not up to standard and you could feel the water was slimy and looked cloudy : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Although listed as a 4 : []
Beach is lovely as well as the spa treatments : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Close to markets and other restaurants : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'bike-ride']
We stayed at this hotel in nov 10, we had interconnecting rooms : []
With our deal we could have breakfast at either the Club (a la carte, table service) or the massive, well stocked Buffett on the ground floor : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
You are sitting in plastic chairs on the sand so no heels, but like I said, very local with vendors coming around selling wares to all the tourists eating : []
Beautiful private beach ! Nice and delicious breakfast, friendly staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We will be back here very soon : []
I had 3! : []
5 year old really enjoyed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our honeymoon was amazing and Nusa Dua beach hotel made that happen! We spent the second half of our honeymoon in Bali; we wanted someplace relaxing after spending the first half of the holiday in Malaysia : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
An option to increase the length would have been good : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
So what we did - was entertain ourselves and also tried to find team to do activities with - thanks to lots of Australians in the hotel it becomes fun, coz mostly people are not bothering themselves with activities other than sunbathing or eating : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff were amazing - the kids got ear infections and we had flowers and fruit delivered to our room - a lovely personal touch : []
My husband and I have just returned from our honeymoon at the Nusa Dua Beach hotel and we have had a wonderful time : []
Location is fantastic with the path all the way across the front of the hotel linking to other hotels whilst following the beach : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
and the buildings in balinese style cannot be matched by the other hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Something for everyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only complaint we had about this resort is that it is very singular : []
Luckily I stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, it was only 3 minutes walk, ClubMed is located next to Nusa2Beach : []
We loved it so much husband and I decided to get married at nusa dua beach hotel and spa : []
The hotel's facilities were nice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The facilities were very high class and the prices are not that unreasonably expensive : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Location is fabulous, being very close to the airport and a 20 minute cab ride into Kuta, and only 50 mins from Ubud : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
there's more of a selection of souvenirs etc : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The two downsides I can think of, there was construction going on at one of their restaurants on the beach but that will obviously end eventually and the poolside and beachside service was a little slow : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'pool']
There was some noise during the day in close proximity but we heard nothing in our room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The rooms are kept very clean and the gardens are spotless, the service is perfect and the food very good, but very pricey, compared with the rest of Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
even peter the manager took time to stop and introduce himself : [u'overall', u'culture']
The architecture retained a distinctive Balinese feel to it : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
the kids had their own beds and TV/dvd player for those nights after long days of swimming : [u'overall', u'culture']
There were a lot of choices in breakfast and the taste was quite good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It's probably close to perfect if you are looking for a nice peaceful place to stay and relax, enjoy the beach, pool, spa etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You could venture into hustling Kuta and its surrounds with a short taxi ride but the return to this oasis was always welcome : [u'location', u'sea']
We visit Bali each year around the time of our wedding anniversary : []
I think that although anyone could argue this is symptomatic of a tropical climate, airing of rooms should be done regularly, with so much incense available, strange there is nothing to deodorize the rooms : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food and dirnk is expensive but the choice is varied if average in quality : [u'overall', u'safety']
Many thanks to Ginastra, Supardi, Supadmi, Suniati, Werni, Fidelsa, Dian, Aitik, Puira, Rashi, Danls, Wardana, Meni, Sadnyana, Karlina, Dewantara, Sugeng all from The Palace Club, Sugeng the head of security, and Dermot F&B manager : [u'overall', u'safety']
My husband & I recently stayed here for 7days in a Palace suite this was an amazing room the amenities top Notch, and the resort it self has so much to offer there is so many choices for dining they even have stall holders come in of an evening so you can even shop without going anywhere else : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Note that if you're in Bali to see temples, this hotel is at the bottom of the island and you will be driving 2 hours to get places : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But surely staying in a resort isn't about your room, right? A room is for sleeping and the rest of the resort is for playing! Some great restaurant options, two fantastic pools and a beautiful beach - all a few steps from your bed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I stayed there during Xmas 2003 : []
We played tennis, went on a tandem bike ride, played table tennis and got family photos taken : []
Most of the therapists have been working there for more than 10 years and they all know what they're doing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff in the club are exceptional nothing is too much trouble and they always have a smile for you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Also, whilst the kids club is great (and free!!), the facilities were small with limited options for the 6 & 8 year old : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The Italian food was not really as good as the 2 other restaurants on site, which is why we marked down the food a little, but the breakfast restaurant was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Bali collection is super close (shops, restaurant/bars : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
October was perfect for us no rain at all and very hot we looked at a lot of hotels around nusa dua, not just saying this but we think best stretch of beach and best hotel on nusa dua : []
Ambiance and location of the hotel was very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Nusa dua Beach Hotel really has to drag itself into the 21st century and provide free wi-fi in the rooms : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
the hotels restaurant on the beach was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
All the restaurants Are waaaay below any Kind of standard considering the ridiculous prices charged for the food : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
10 minutes later I asked again , shocking service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was our first experience of such a 5 star hotel and it was unbelievable : []
Otherwise I felt I was in a business hotel : []
All in all a wonderful experience : [u'overall', u'feel']
The hotel also arranged a romantic dinner for two in the middle of the swimming ppol area for an extra cost : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The room was not as plush or impressive as the Conrad : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Room - The room was a decent size for the 2 of us : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Things like our shower gel, shampoo, conditioner etc were not replaced daily even though they were empty or nearly so : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We thoroughly enjoyed our third stay at the hotel : []
Let's talk about a gross margin of 900%! Shame on you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel! I think it's really rood; not even a bottle of water in our hotel in Gothenburg costs so much : []
We called for a doctor - there is a clinic nearby - and within 15 minutes a doctor, nurse and a suitcase full of Medication arrived : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
The hotel was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff became like friends to us over the 6 days we stayed there and we have only wonderful memories from the time we spent there and definitely did not want to leave so soon! : []
Lots of activities on offer : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Will come back! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Although very busy she managed to find time make us feel valued and make it a special experience : []
The water pressure in the shower as well : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
the rooms are beautifully designed and the staff were very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Every moment greeted with kind, friendly hard working staff : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The grounds and the Spa are beautiful : [u'overall', u'safety']
This was our third stay in the Palace Club and it was just terrific : []
loved the view and service : [u'room-experience', u'view']
And the food was first class : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Our whole family love staying here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The driver side-tripped us to the coffee 'plantation', which was a small display of two young civets, a free sampling session and a shop : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Bar prices a bit too expensive, All else A1 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Theme night food is OK but nothing to rave about, atmosphere where the fire dance was held was great and the food was tasty : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
My suggestion to management is that they seriously consider having a place for the guests to dance with some good music : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Quiet location : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
The free shuttle bus (5 mins) to and from the local shopping centre called Bali Collection was good, the supermarket there was useful and we also enjoyed a cheaper alternative to 5 star hotel meals : []
Rooms were very average, and clearly this part of the resort has not yet been renovated : [u'amenities', u'conference']
First room given was overlooking major building works : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
the cocktails & food was great too : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
Air con was a bit noisy in the room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Departure was not the Limo we had expected but it arrived ten minutes later than ordered and we managed to board our plane on-time, yet with concern : []
All the beauty, warmth, welcome and magic of Bali in Nusa Dua's premier location with none of the negatives associated with nouveau five star hotels, which can be unrelaxing and pretentious : [u'amenities', u'conference']
the bath was very high and it was difficult for my mum to get into the shower, the place was tidy but not properly clean, we had no free wifi in our rooms which was a requirement for us when booking, infact it was an extra AUD11 per day which I was angry about as we booked requesting free wifi in our room, it was only free in the lobby and around the pool : []
Since I was only drinking bottled water, the free bottled water in the room was appreciated : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We did spas, lunch, dinner and shopping all while our kids had room service and watched movies : [u'overall', u'culture']
The beach was a two minute walk and was white sands and clear waters : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We stayed here for 9 nights and had a great time : []
This hotel is a bit on the expensive side : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Cons: Our room, deluxe room in garden wing, was very small : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
It was so romantic and fantastic, including champagne! They closed the pool for our meal and we were surrounded by candles and flowers : []
We had Romantic dinner on the beach, with superb service, although the balinese cooking is not worth the price they ask : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The service was great with one exception: when we checked in second room of ours was not ready : []
There are better choices for this price range and this location (in Nusa Dua) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Upgraded to Palace Club was worth the money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
All in all we had a great time : []
Nice for parents but not for couples : [u'overall', u'culture']
The only blemish on what was an enjoyable stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is a mega resort with personal service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are other restaurants in the nearby village and also in Jimbaran which provide transport to and from the hotel : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Seriously would go for breakfast anytime I am in Bali : []
The bathroom could have used a good bleach scrub down and the house keeping didn't do the best job with the daily cleanings : [u'room', u'furniture']
From hotel to Bali airport, it would cost 150,000 Rp by hotel taxi, conversely, only cost 60,000 by local taxi : []
The spa was unbelievably great, once we went there we swam in its secluded pool every afternoon : []
On occasion it was difficult finding seating, but that was not the norm : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed at the hotel for one week in August : []
Check in/out was very fast and pleasant : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed here in Jan 2013 for a week and what a week we had it was wonderful : []
Enjoy BALI!! : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
With the hotel running at full capacity over the Easter break, you would not know it other than at the breakfast bar : []
Stayed here for a week for a conference which was being held next door at the Westin : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The Palace Club facilities made our holiday perfect : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
I did early booking so I missed the promised discounts by congress organiser : []
It was truly a great place to stay in Bali (Nusa Dua) : []
it got to a piont where we didnt have the afternoon tea most days as there was so much lovley food to eat !! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
A nice hotel with beautiful surrounds : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Good for families, we had family room (interconnecting rooms) which were ideal : [u'amenities', u'conference']
When we arrived we were ushered to the club for check in which was very fast and we were shown to a lovely ground floor room which had plenty of space and lots of cupboards and drawers : [u'amenities', u'conference']
What bothers me is that why don't give the better room in the 1st time? It was a pretty unpleasant experience, but except this, the whole journy in Bali and Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is great! : []
Bit on the expensive side (but it is common in Bali at the resorts) : []
Just breathtaking : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There were three pools, one that had volleyball and beach feel for kids, and another with a swim up bar and the third in the spa area which was a quiet area with no kids : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The facilities and the fantastic staff made it worthwhile : []
We moved the furniture around a bit to make it easier for the 1 year old to crawl around : []
The resort itself has beautiful architecture and many things to see : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
no complain : []
Luckily we really didn't spend a lot of time in our room, and when it came to sleeping being a seasoned traveller I always carry earplugs so was able to block any noise from above : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
Other breakfast buffet was very crowded and noisy with kids, but served what we needed : []
should be 6 star instead ! Beachfront views,clean presented rooms and a terrific atmosphere : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Be it while checking or Breakfast, Pool side Restaurants or even during their Dinner With Traditional Bali Dance : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Stayed in Premier Rooms overlooking duck ponds and gardens : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The very pleasant young lady the second time I asked for help, did apologise for the inconvenience and offer to change rooms : [u'overall', u'culture']
They have a 'Palace Club' section were I think you might have to reserve to use the ones in that area, but you must go by and see them!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room was very clean, bed was super comfy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
Setting and ambience remains superb, staff are excellent and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Particularly the ladies on the customer service desk : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is amazingly beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It fits the bill nicely : []
Overall rate the experience as very high : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We will return : []
You can walk the beach and end up at a local temple overlooking the sea : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
That was perfect honeymoon at this hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There's some good restaurant there too : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The girl there made a phone call & told me the refund will be processed : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The biggest I've ever been to : []
However, we asked for and were granted a room change because the bathroom of the first room allocated to us was quite unsatisfactory --- small, no bath tub, shower with only a half door so the water would just splash all over the floor and the unhygienic situation of the toilet being in close proximity to the wash basin and towels : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Very well maintained : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We play squash every morning after breakfast in a beautiful air conditioned court which helped work off the breakfast lol : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The beach was clean and the plants were well-tended : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Staff were fantastic : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The food was fabulous and the service terrific : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Most hotels and resorts restrict the depth to 1 : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
There are sellers of clothing and other items on the beach that you expect will be annoying but in fact they are all licensed and behave well : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The beach is charming, the sand were spotless which means a lot when the crystal water in the low tide is full of seaweed : [u'amenities', u'pool']
At low tide, there is no swimming, just mud flats : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The service is impeccable and fine cuisine will please all palates : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
By Barry S : []
In this way we had a more various vacation experiencing also the hustle and bustle of the chic restaurant of that area : []
The only other downside we found was the wifi only being available in the lobby : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Here are some pros: : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Have just returned from spending 10 days at this hotel and what a hotel it was - WOW : []
Brekfast is great and they manage crowds very well : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Vast courtyards, massive entrances, sprawling gardens, private beach, sumptuous breakfast buffet and lovely cocktails : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Thank you to the wonderful Staff and Management : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Only criticism was the access to Wifi : [u'amenities', u'internet']
New facilities are being built and will be exciting new additions : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There is simply not one aspect of the hotel, its staff, food, accommodation, spa, pool, restaurants, grounds, locality that we couldn't rate 10/10 with only one minor exception : []
No wishes were left open : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
it lived up to our expectations and more!! : []
I can understand having international restaurants here, but not the abysmal quality or high price : []
Also, the grounds were amazing in terms of architecture, tradition and landscaping : [u'overall', u'safety']
I just wanted to give a balanced review so that people do not think that all is peachy about this hotel : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The room was good : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
If you want to get out and about and shop/party/dine I would recommend Legian or Seminyak : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We hope we will continue to visit the Palace Club : []
These are not as cheap as the village so I would suggest you buy only the necessities at the Bali collection and then head to the village : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms were clean and spacious and well equipped : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We have stayed in various hotels on the Kuta side : []
we booked our trip with AsiaLuxe Holidays and what a find they were, especially Darrell Clausen, a consummate pro : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They need to do much more to claim 5 star status : [u'room-experience', u'view']
We always enjoy the traditional Balinese massages, and love the exotic fragrances of the oils and scrubs : []
No wifi in rooms which was annoying - only in lobby and bars : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The bustle of Bali is only a taxi ride way : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The staff were all welcoming and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Extremely friendly and polite service during Breakfast, our names were remembered every day : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
If you want to use it in your room or around the resort, you have to pay for it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thank you for making our anniversary special : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
They even have an atm inside the property : [u'room', u'furniture']
Our rooms were well appointed and modern, with lovely welcome notes and fruit bowls : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
4 or 5 restaurants to choose from, as well as 3 pools and 3 or 4 bars : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
There are also small market stalls to the right at the beachfront and right again where the beach runs into the road about 10 minute walk : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
One of the best breakfast buffets I've seen : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Perfect getaway for 3 days of relaxation : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel facilities we at a high standard and can't be faulted : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Kids enjoyed the kids massage at the on site spa : [u'overall', u'culture']
The first impression of this hotel is a good one : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I really enjoyed the special dinner buffets with the local cultural,Breakfast and overall food quality was exemplary : []
The beach was also fine, although the sun loungers on the beach look very cheap compared to the nice furniture at the other hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I have paid considerably more for buffets in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane that were nowhere near the quality on offer here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great food something for everyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Special welcoming letter addressed to us : []
The hotel is beautiful, with the balinese architecture and landscaping : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Unlike many other beaches in Bali plus there is an abundance of water sports at reasonable rates for them to engage in : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
3 nights in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was not enough! The room was great, the breakfast was awesome and the environment was the best! A nice quite yet breezy day we spent the afternoon laying on the beach and on the evening there's nothing better than swimming on the pool : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
THis tells me that he listens to nobody, doesn't accept imperfections and anyone with that mindset will not make improvements in my experience : [u'overall', u'feel']
We stayed in the palace club room which was well worth the extra expence : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We arrived at the start of Sept and alot of our family and friends were also flying in from around the world and staying at the same resort as us so it was really important to us that we were made to feel special and we were : []
however we were perfectly happy with the hotel : []
They also had a chef who would make any type of omelet for you : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Food and drink r expensive : []
Friendly and helpful staff, comfortable room cleaned every day, a pillow menu! Activities if you are interested : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There are a number of great restaurants from casual to fine dining and there are great local restaurants outside of the resort complex : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
One could spend a week at Nusa Dua and have no idea what Bali is really like : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
I'm really surprised at the glowing positive reviews for this place as we felt it was just OK : []
The public rooms were beautiful and well kept but our deluxe room was a bit tired and we did experience a bit of noise from garden renovations under our balcony perhaps we should have chosen a club room : []
But still great to start the day with a slow coffee and watch all the fish in the pond next to the cafe : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant']
The main pools are good, one is more for the children, and the other one has a swim-up bar, the water is warm : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We had initially booked 6 nights and planned to move to another hotel afterwards but extended our stay at the NDBH for another 6 nights because we liked it so much : []
Ask them to call in a 'meter taxi' , which are so much cheaper than the hotel's own : [u'amenities', u'conference']
More shade around the pool would be great : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The service is overall ok but very uneven, sometimes you get the very nice cold towel before you order lunch in the restaurant and sometimes not : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff remember your name and ask everyday when you come in how your stay is going : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
best time to go September, weather is just right : [u'location', u'sea']
Fruitselection was great : []
The pool area is well designed and situated right by the very clean beach which has shaded loungers and waiter service available : [u'amenities', u'patio']

Wishi had : []
We really enjoyed our cooking class by Katut and would highly recommend this to anyone interested in cooking : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had an amazing stay at the Nesa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
During our stay the volcanic ash had disrupted the travel plans of many guests and the hotel went from being very quiet to being extremely busy, however the staff did a great job coping and ensuring a high standard of service : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The crepe station always had a line and often ran out of toppings : [u'location', u'station']
Thanks very much to all of you to make this such a nice time for us : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Buffet breakfast and other meals were pretty good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
the Balinese style buildings : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Hopefully they will keep the Balinese design, atmosphere & ambience : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The room was spacious, the breakfast was sumptious and plenty : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Our visit was for two nights after a stay in Seminyak and Cepaka first, We always finish of our Bali holidays with a couple of nights in Nusa Dua or Jimbaran just to wind down and chill out : []
We move on : []
I was glad to enter my room 32220 with ocean view : []
We did go there independently recently in October to have another look whilst staying at another hotel and enjoyed the two meals we had on the beach so we may be back very soon : []
The club room we had was spacious : []
Use Bluebird taxis as these are metered and it cost 90,000 IDR (5 quid) to get to Kuta : []
Granted those expectations weren't very high : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I loved the variety at bfast, suited to many cultures : []
Your hotel is definitely 5 star but to me the staff rate 10 stars, I am tearing up just writing this review on your beautiful hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff are friendly and go out of their way to make your stay one to remember : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There are plenty restaurants in the hotel and outside hotel within walking distance (Bali Collection), there's also shuttle every hour to get there : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Perfect spot for a nightcap : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
But as you know there are devices that works on wifi only : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
, although the next day I saw a lot of PRC : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Absolutely wonderful hotel with fantasic staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It turned out to be a great break for them : []
The aircon thermostat didn't work properly : [u'room', u'appliances']
Having booked this property for our Daughter & Son in Law's honeymoon 3 years ago we thought we would book the same for our 40th Annivesary following their reviews : [u'amenities', u'internet']
I'll definitely go back there again : []
You can take a walk along the path behind the hotel to enjoy nusa dua beach and some of its beach bars : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Serving at Maguro restaurant was quite slow : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel itself is gorgeous and grand - it lights up at night and honestly looks like a postcard : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You also need to keep 150,000 rupiah pp for an exit tax fee from the airport : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great meals and lots cheaper than the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
1) In the buffet section please specify whether the food is vegetarian (with/ without egg) or non vegetarian with the standard green or red marks : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
I stayed at this hotel in September 2011 : []
The wi-fi is available in the public areas which is okay, to have the wi-fi in your room, you need to pay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- loved the bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
It's an easy walk to other facilities/restaurants/sops etc : []
No, the food is better than good, its superb : []
It made me feel really welcomed : []
Thank you to the resort and Luxury Escapes : [u'amenities', u'pool']
There is nothing negative that I could point during my stay of 4nights and 5days : []
Sun lounges by the pool fill up fast : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The surrounding area is also very clean and well maintained : [u'location', u'general']
Great service, excellent facilities and great food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
which is great for the kids : [u'amenities', u'conference']
While we came here because our daughter had stayed here a year back, we will recommend this as THE place to stay to our friends and family : []
We found the pools, grounds and beach to be very clean, and the sea water pleasant and crystal clear at this time of the year : []
i called two times to repair tub bath because it's blocked : []
Our only concern in this excellent visit was the height of the bed! : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
The Spa services are wonderful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
He was so nice and very friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Prices are a bit over the top for Bali but that's what you expect in this style of resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were lovely and very friendly especially to our 4 year Old son : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The rooms were clean and well maintained : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
They only only went a couple of times and really didn't want to go back : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Stayed here on a luxury escape deal , we found this of great value , the resort facilties are great location sensational, the staff are great in general , service in some restaurants is a little bit hit and miss but the good outweighs the bad , food choices at breakfst is unbelievable and great value , the buffet food at night functions exceptional, the food at other outlets ok , the service at the pool bar greatq, during ourstay I fell gravely ill and the help of the staff on this occasion was nothing but exceptional from getting a doctor to the room in 20 minutes to calling and checking on me and also sending flowers to the room , the management and the staff need to take a bow and be very proud of there efforts in all areas of customer relations : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As it was fairly late we then just climbed into bed to enjoy our 1st night of sound sleep : []
Even though Nusa Dua one of many resorts in a gated area, read the tourist info because the concierge will not direct you anywhere but the hotel you stay in : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort's massages were fantastic even though they were free as part of out package deal : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
As someone coming from north America (where we can safely drink tap water for free just about anywhere), it's a bit hard to come to terms with paying 2 or 3$ for a water when already paying a premium for a meal : []
5 star beachfront resort Nusa Dua Bali Indonesia with luxury rooms, big swimming pools and good family friendly beach : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Our other meals tended to be at Bali Collection which had a lot of options, but unfortunatley each place we chose resulted in just mediocre average meals : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The resort is located on a private beach with very few sellers so we were not hassled the few times we actually used the beach : []
If you get out into the beach and walk to the left you will also find a lot of shacks as well as people who provide you water sports they are safe too : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
But these rooms are farest from the reception and very inconvenient : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I particularly recommend having one of these as soon as possible after a long flight and just before leaving on one but honestly I could start every day with one of these : []
Check in was smooth and the room was a nice size , well decorated with a ground floor terrace overlooking the gardens : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I came here expecting an amazing resort but unfortunately it didn't meet those needs! There was No pool lounges free for use as there are limited lounges for amount of guests so everytime we went to pool instead of being able to lounge around there were no beds free : []
Get in early to secure your sun lounges around the pool - people "reserve" their lounges early by placing their towels on them and then coming back to them hours later! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
It was clean and fresh everytime we enter the room : []
The food at Chef Restaurant by the pool was a little disappointing and I'd give this a miss : []
Stayed here 3 nights recently : [u'location', u'sea']
On a personal note if we were to return to Bali we would head North or North West as we couldn't help feeling we were 20 years too late, as southern Bali is crazy busy and not necessarily the idyllic place you see in the brochures : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Open and airy and you really get the feel of the place you are in : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rating this hotel with "excellent", because Bali is beautiful might be not a perfect rating for the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
No complaints about the rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
It was a nice change from the hustle and bustle of Legian so peaceful : []
It was exactly like the pictures had shown! stunning hotel, modern yet a balinese feel to it, helpful staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Wife and I stayed here and it was excellent : []
Activities abound in the evenings for those who enjoy entertainment: The dinners that accompany Kecak dance show, the Legong Dance Show and the Fire Dance Show are plentiful and comprehensive : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
On the beach, there is a wonderful view and plenty of space : [u'room-experience', u'view']
The spa area is a lovely area to relax and unwind with a large variety of treatments and there is also a games room in that area too : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We were looking for a place to relax and kickback - and we got exactly what we were looking for : []
I can safely say I got it right again : []
It's an easy stroll to the Bali Collection but the hotel restaurants are well priced ( for food) and great quality : []
Ah don't sit close to the musicians in legong dance, you may lose your hearing abilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Excellent breakfast especially all the tropical fruits that tasted so delicious : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is a bus that takes you there for free however not that reliable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You will not be sorry if you choose to stay here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Have no hesitation returning again or recommending the Nus Dua Beach and Spa Resort to family and friends : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The staff were all very friendly, attentive, and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
if you think it's a good idea to put a book on a lounge then go for breakfast, go to the fitness centre etc : []
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel has been an absolute oasis in the hectic world that is Bali for the tourist : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pretty good burgers at the Chess Bar and ditto for the pizza at the Italian restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
After getting over our few hurdles we had a great time and are happy to say that we are planning a family holiday next year with a group of 16 : []
My wife (still not used to saying that!) and I stayed at this hotel for just over a week a few weeks ago as part of our honeymoon : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nice garden, clean, with some animals : [u'location', u'forest']
Just don't get a taxi through the front desk : [u'room', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'conference', u'elevator', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Over all we enjoyed the peace and quiet and the space the resort offered the gardens and surrounds were well kept : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
5 years old), comfortable ground-floor interconnecting rooms and we were looking for somewhere with a beachfront location to renew our vows at for our 10 year anniversary : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The resort does maintain the beach pretty well : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Afternoon tea was served "English style' on a 3 tier stand, and other than the dry sandwiches, was also good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There is also a shuttle to the shopping at Bali Collection : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
We were made very welcome and they pampered us all the time : []
Pools suitable for all ages, but the large and deep main pool was a hit with the kids : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The Hotel grounds are beautiful and are home to many birds, lots of squirrels a few very large lizards and the beach is a nesting area for sea turtles : [u'overall', u'safety']
However, with a pleasant smile and wonderful manner, they let you in with no hassle : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The beach was quiet and lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
the days were long with sight seeing : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
also the driver will give you his number and be there and time any day during your time in Bali to escort you around : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
You pay extra for all of these services : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had never been to Nusa Dua before and booked this resort randomly, it was a very pleasant surprise : []
they are beautiful, nicely furbished, the bathroom is great nice and big and definately not what you would find in Australia (where we are from) unless you are royalty and can afford the world! The room for myself and my sister had two single beds which is what we had requested - they are very comfortable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I appreciate the location and value of Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, as well as the very friendly and helpful staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Although the whole hotel team was magnificent, we have to give a special mention to Arini & Rina (Guest Relations), Wahyu (Beach & Pool) and Anita (Breakfast) who went out of their way to make our stay as special as possible, our special thanks go to these individuals : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is also a really cheap convenience store near Nyomens & Mai Mai as well : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We stayed at Nusa dua beach hotel in October 2011 and can't rave enough about it : []
Good range of restaurants including a variety of specialty dinners with Balinese dances, good spa, lovely grounds and swimming pools : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Not enough beds on the beach !!! Some had to lay on the ground! :-( : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
It was a truly amazing experience : []
One thing I will pull the hotel up on : []
I will definitely be returning : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we have spend our Chinese new year Holidays over there Which was fantastic : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Public areas, reception, pool areas and restaurants were very very good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed in a Palace Club suite which is very spacious with a large balcony overlooking the lovely gardens : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The pools were nice also : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
For us this was 6th visit, difficult to tell about Hotel, faults and goods, we see place so differently, place where we know how to relax and what to get, wine issue was problem for us, but otherwise people there and also away how Hotel is leaded make this place worth to visti, all there are made for customers, if you need and ask you get and almost without asking, for children there is Gecko club, saw many times laughing, playing kids with excellent nanny's how play with them and really like job, cannot be oherwise : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For those that are using the deals : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In my stay, I did not get a good sleep : []
Definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Great cuisine and Japanese revelation : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Breakfast was very good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Overall I would absolutely recommend this hotel and resort, hardly any children there which was really nice, although it did have a good family friendly feel too : []
In line with our expectations, we've been there 23y ago on honeymoon and we still found a very reputable and excellent hotel; of course years passed by for everybody, but Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is still in a very good shape : []
The staff at the kids club were very good and our kids loved the place : [u'overall', u'culture']
The staff are widely experienced compared to the new and modern hotels who are still striving to achieve what now comes naturally to the Nusa Dua Beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We casually "inspected" each of the other properties during our stay, in case we found a better one than ours, but ours was by far the overall best, for many reasons : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
10/10 in my books! :) : [u'overall', u'culture']
indeed a quiet place and nature friendly : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
It has relaxing music while you are swimming - lush : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Spa is lovely, treatments very relaxing : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The breakfasts are beautiful and nothing is to much trouble : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
They kept telling me it was fine : []
I only had a few days in Bali and I wanted to make the most of my time there : []
The team were very tolerant in us having some of the cocktails closer to our room after they had gone to bed : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Blacony also pleasant with nice chairs : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We had most meals at the hotel which were incredible : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We've just spent 7 glorious days at this resort in fabulous Bali weather : []
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in this hotel and never wanted to leave from there : []
Again the staff were amazing and we would recommend this hotel for family : []
pools and sports facilities, table tennis, tennis, gym just great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just outside are about 3-4 restaurants and lots of little stalls plus supermarkets and currency exchange : [u'location', u'general']
The hotel is also located right at the gates of the Nusa Dua complex so you can also walk out and browse some shops and restaurants : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast spread was very large with a variety of options : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There is Wi Fi in the room so next time I will take my computer instead : []
Loved everything about the resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I booked this hotel as the last minute as I couldn't fixed the holiday date due to tentative meeting : [u'location', u'sea']
There are various cultural performances put on at the open air theatre in the middle of the grounds, and I would recommend that you see at least one as they are a great way to take in some traditional Balinese culture : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Concierge and Bell Staff tried to arrange transportation/trips for me that were SO much more expensive than they should be : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However, we were disappointed : []
In the cot when we arrived was even a package of baby toiletries, Johnson and Johnson : []
Everything is on hand and the pool and beach were great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We loved the suite and the amenities were great at this place : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
As a 'solo' traveller, I have nothing but praise for my experience staying at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
The staff overall was quite unresponsive and unhelpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Beautiful resort in a great location away from the hustle and bustle : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We would not ever consider staying anywhere else on another visit to Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
An excellent environment with wonderfully accommodating, helpful staff! Palace Club room / suite had truly pleasing associated benefits - a must re upgrading if you choose to attend! Showing signs of age but the resort has soul / character that the newer venues lack : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The other was the small choice of wine on the menu and the huge cost to buy a bottle of wine : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
All of the rooms are luxurious and clean : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Everything was continually topped up so you were never short of any foods : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are very clean and of a moderately stylish appearance : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We left having had a great holiday but our opinion is that this old place is indeed only average and we would be be very unlikely to return : []
Resort close to shopping centre and many restaurants that are cheaper ( and in many cases better ) than the Resorts offering : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Special mention to the guy at the swimup bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Kids bed not in room on arrival and waited over an hour to get it : [u'overall', u'culture']
My stay at your hotel was very nice except for a few things : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We spent a week here in August 2014, the hotel was lovely, great staff, good food, excellent pools and access to the beach, and the hotel's restaurants in the evening were wonderful, particularly the chess bar and restaurant literally on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
As part of the Palace club we were welcomed to delicious breakfast, afternoon teas and cocktails in the evening : []
There is a check-out room for showering and relaxing after you have checked out : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Wines and Sparkling run at $10-$12 a glass : []
You also get to choose your own salads and sauces : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Needs re-doing : []
Very relaxed before we hit Gili! : []
Pool was really nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
An advantage the NDBH has over the Conrad is the lack of noisy water sports off it's beach : []
Every day was relaxing : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Having a private beach helps a lot too : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We chose a room overlooking the tropical garden and were really happy with it : []
It is run by Bali Collection, a yucky shopping tourist compound nearby that has a supermarket but we spent 20 minutes there and left : []
Came away feeling so relaxed! The perfect day package was amazing and included a 3 course lunch! : []
The buffet breakfast was excellent with a good international selection of hot and cold food, pastries, exotic fresh fruit and juices: the soursop juice was absolutely delicious! And I particularly enjoyed the fresh passion fruits, guavas and yellow watermelon : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The prices were extremely high though : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel is popular with discerning Japanese and Australian tourists : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The buffet breakfast selection and quality was pretty average : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
The resort is an heavenly experience : [u'amenities', u'pool']
the lovely soft music playing in the background : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
One drawback was the fridge : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Not brand new but very well kept : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Gym is totally out dated : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Yes yummy drinks at the pool bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The management was very polite : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Our room was clean and well appointed, staff were all wonderful, cocktails at the pool bar were sublime : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
Although child friendly, not too busy or noisy with kids : [u'overall', u'culture']
The public areas are open to the outdoors, which some may not like, but I absolutely loved it because I try to avoid air conditioning whenever I can : []
We availed ourselves of the spa services, several times and were very pleased : []
The room was finally available at 5pm : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We ate at a few of the restaurants and the food is fabulous : []
We stayed at the Nusa Dua Hotel in January for our Honeymoon and it was the best decision we made : []
We have stayed there many times over the years and it is consistently good : []
We had an amazing vacation and have no complain at all! Also, its architecture makes it the most unique hotel, if you want to feel you are in Bali, go to NDBHS, it is beautiful!!! : []
For an international resort, they need a few more people who can speak English : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We therefore had to spend very little on extras : []
Checked in quite late in the day, arrival admin was completed very quickly : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Great Place to stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I trusted the travel agent : []
Eventually, Hotel deserves 5 * Gold value : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Rooms - good size (we had 2 adjoining with interconnecting door) and very comfortable : []
Their feedback was that the Nusa Dua was much better since the Westin had less of a genuine feel and the bedrooms there were apparently tired (carpets etc : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We really didn't like the gated community of luxury hotels with a security guard to keep out the local people : []
lovely time had by all : [u'location', u'sea']
Somebody might have an opinion that it gives a feel of old balinese style : []
However the price of food and drink is ridiculous : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Had a lovely and relaxing stay at this hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I always felt little high humidity in the room : []
Six friends booked via Tradewinds and stayed seven nights out of a three week far east holiday, : [u'overall', u'culture']
The most beautiful kept gardens to stroll around, there is a great walking path/cycle path along the beach, that will take you to all the other resorts in Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
its a beautify property with a magical private beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We will definitely return to Nusa Dua again in the near future : []
Was fixed Thankfully : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The fruit basket supplied and replenished daily, superb : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
After discussing this with the manager we were upgraded as an apology for free - this was well worth it as we were moved to a better located room and had no compliants : []
but i saw them very nice to overseas guess : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Either than that, all was very good : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Please make bathroom better, it seems torn down : []
We travel extensively on business so were desperate to relax and that's exactly what we did here : []
We choose the club lounge room and we had a separate breakfast with a nice lake : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We go to the beach more often than amusement parks : []
We had a very attractive deal to stay in a Palace Club Suite : []
I would highly recommend this property to everyone : []
The hotel is amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We avoid Kuta like the plague, it's horrendous, especially compared with Nusa Dua which is so clean and not over the top : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We certainly can give our recommendation to anyone considering the Nusa Dua Beach : []
The beach quality improved and we jumped in for a swim : []
We asked at our reception where we could go to get to Nusa Dua town and they suggested an outdoor shopping strip or the markets : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel is very close to Ubud , a place that I wanted to see for a long time : []
The hotel had employed a professional from the UK to train the bar staff on cocktail making (the espresso martinis were amazing!) The drinks were a little expensive but what some people fail to realise is that this is a five star resort and it is expensive to drink in a lot of places in Bali as they have to import (a bottle of Jacobs creek in a local supermarket set me back $70) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The Wellness area was amazing and those massages were better than any here at home, our daughter even had 2 with chocolate smelling oil : [u'overall', u'culture']
Staff were always extremely helpful when asked : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The Manager, Gin was his nick name was Brilliant from walking in the door to checkout anything i wanted to do from white water rafting to eating out one phone call to him and it was done : []
The hotel comfort is fine : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall we enjoyed our stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But I was naturally very offended by this : []
The hotel food is lovely but pricey compared to other aeras of Nusa Dua, for example; : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The rooms are just ok : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Very nice hotel, good prices and infraestructure, good amenities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room and all the amenities were very clean and modern, breakfast buffet was adequate and evening dining options also not bad : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The gardens were well maintained, the pools were stunning and the staff were very nice : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The breakfast was great and the resort beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We booked the Deluxe rooms which were big enough and had a balcony overlooking the pool, beach and gardens, but we asked to move to ground floor rooms with garden access so it was easier to get to the pool : []
The resort exceeded our expectations, we celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary during our stay and were pleasantly surprised by being given a room upgrade including a welcomming glass of bubbly and flowers to kick our holiday off : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Its is just amazing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All the staff without exception were very friendly, always greeted you and asked if everything was OK, they were never pushy : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The lobby is beautiful, the hotel is crumbling and has a lot of wear and tear everywhere : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The variety of food available was great : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I have stayed here 4 times now : []
Elephant riding, cookery classes and a trip to ubud and surrounding villages which we booked through our tour guide which was provided through Thomas cook : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Frankly I think the hotel under-sells its grounds : [u'overall', u'safety']
We arrived on a Saturday afternoon : []
Highly recommended will return again next year : [u'location', u'sea']
The complex is huge and the pool is large (although quite a distance from alot of the rooms so ask for a room close to the pool, this will also enable better beach views) : [u'overall', u'culture']
We did move rooms to the palace suites which really 'made' our holiday as deluxe rooms were too small as 2 adults and a 10yo boy : [u'amenities', u'conference']
our room is nice and our view amazing : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
But the infrastructure badly needs maintenance : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The room was great clean and tidy with nice garden view from our sitting area : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Atmosphere is so nice from front-desk until the beachside area : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
My family and I stayed here last Easter for about 10 days : [u'overall', u'culture']
The hotel is very nice and clean with private beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Had some lovely cocktails in the lobby bar too : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
You may even witness a religious ceremony or two : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Good selection for breakfast as well : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Also, toothpaste and toothbrushes should be free in a five star hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Vouchers in your welcome pack were handy to reduce your bills at the restaurants and bars : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
A very warm and caring person, a real Balinese : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Third time I was at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
However, Lounge Hogs beware : [u'amenities', u'garden']
In the evening at 7 P : []
They upgraded us to a suite upon arrival : [u'amenities', u'banquet']
Don't worry about these, they ask each day but a polite "no", they smile say good-by and move on : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Pretty good soundproofing in rooms, although voices from the corridors can be heard : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
We booked this hotel for our honeymoon and had a great experience here! : []
The bedroom had a king sized bed, tables, built-in wardrobe, tables, chairs etc and opened onto a balcony with pleasant view over the garden : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Another inconvenient matter happened again in the next day at breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
every morning i was excited for their buffet breakfast n just simply loved the realaxation it offered to a honeymoon couple like us : []
A marvelous time in Indonesia : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The ambiance created at every area of the resort is amazing : [u'overall', u'spacious']
I chose Deluxe Room, and couldn't feel how deluxe it was : []
all very satisfying : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One night we just took a walk after dinner so we could get pictures of everything there was to see : []
The room was clean, but housekeeping could be a bit more thorough in their work : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Private beach is great, lots of pools and Raja's does the best bebek betutu I've ever had : []
And for me this is a put off, less practical, wasting time, spend more for transport, and get off from, no offense to the locals, two stars places : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The buffet breakfast is excellent and offers a large variety of food options : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We have always LOVE staying @ Nusadua area when we holiday in Bali : []
The highlight of our stay was The Palace Club and their wonderful staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My husband and I together with our very good friends are just back from 10 nights holidaying at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
There is a shuttle to a nearby shopping area : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Nicely located on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Bali Collection was the outdoor shopping strip - within walking distance along the beach from our hotel or just get on the free shuttle bus - and we spent a couple of nights or lunches here for a very cheap lunch or dinner and a good look around the stalls and shops here : []
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa was a great place to relax on a kid free getaway : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It has a "family resort" feel, which isn't great for all couples : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We booked bed and breakfast but also ate in the restaurants on a couple of occasions the food was very good the staff well they just could not do enough for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We definately reccomend the show on the beach : []
The room was big enough for 3 people (triple sharing room) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
but pricey : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
All the staff is so friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The hotel offered everything that we could ask for : []
The location is excellent, blend with the nature, although it is a very large complex of hotel : []
The palace up grade was nice for a couple of days but to be honest for the extra cost you can live without it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Some of the issues encountered: booking only recognized by the supervisor after a long discussion, insisting cleaning staff despite the not disturb sign on the door, poorly managed restaurant (eg : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We were there to attend a wedding and spent 3 nights at this hotel : []
Hotel shop prices were 3 times the price of local shopping area : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Personally I found Jimbaran bay to quite disappointing and over priced seafood compared to other parts of Bali! : []
do try it : []
The Palace Club privileges include the the club lounge where our breakfast, High Tea, and evening cocktails were served and free internet was available 24 hours per day : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
After staying at this hotel last year for 5 nights, we decided to have our wedding here (Sept : []
gardens and pools are immaculate : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The rooms were not that clean need to be improved, and sheets yellow and marked : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Above all though, the buffet breakfast was like nothing we have ever seen or experienced : []
We definitely will come back! : []
We are happy to recommend the Nusa Dua Beach and Spa to others : []
Cannot speak highly enough of The Palace Club staff, Mr Sunada, Suniati, Supadmi, Wardana and Sugiarta, together with all of the others : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Spa was wonderful with excellent staff and facilities and was a tonic to both the body and the soul : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
think about putting a little bit of shelter over the patio area, if it rains (like it did for 2 days) there's no where to sit without getting soaked, you cant even have the sliding doors open without having to mop up the floor : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a beautiful ocean front room and were delighted : []
Rooms were clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
, clock radio which also controlled the lights, tea making facilities with free coffees and two bottles of free waters a day, mini bar, wardrobe with ample draw space, dressing gowns, slippers, umbrellas and safe : [u'amenities', u'patio']
As a family of four who have traveled with our kids all around the Asia/ Pacific region, we have never experienced such kind, genuine and attentive staff in any hotel-I can't speak anymore highly about the entire team at this hotel : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Loved the resort pools, beach, gym, spa, Sandro's pizza restaurant and the buffet breakfast the best : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Definitely try the sweet n sour chicken, teriyaki beef, boneless beef ribs dish or the sate chicken appetiser : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Staffs are all friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The resort was nice it could just do with cleaner bathrooms : []
Amazing experience and recommended to everyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We personally visited the top 10 resotrs in Nusa Dua and constantly came up with N D Beach ans being the best for various different reasons, eg, cost us $20 : []
No free internet inside room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We particularly enjoyed the pool and pool bar : []
The sausage was gamey though : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Large scented Frangipanis fall around you and seduce you into holiday mode : []
The pool area is stunning : [u'location', u'general']
Spa & beach area: There's a Spa adjacent to the hotel, we never used this so can't comment on it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We needed a location central to our dealer/customers in the Asia Pacific area, Bali fitted the bill perfectly and we could not of chosen a better hotel : []
I must compliment the egg cook, his omlettes were delicious : []
The rooms are older but they are spacious and all have balconies with a view : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
NDBH is situated on a fine stretch of beach, and is well-outfitted with multiple pool areas : []
The Palace Club is well worth the extra with larger rooms and private service away from the main dining area of the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The lifts are dodgy to say the least and the doors slammed shut on me once and bruised both of my arms : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Moreover, and I am quite sensible to this, is that the interior had seen better days: too old, paint peeling off the wood : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
People enjoy dancing and the atmosphere at the resort is a great environment for people to dance the night away : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
After breakfast, you can take a quick dip in the pool or wander towards the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I would recommend this to anyone who would like to enjoy traditional Balinese architecture and great hospitality, beautiful resort and take advantage of the swimming pool and the lovely garden : [u'amenities', u'patio']
It was surprisingly comfortable : []
The ability to work whilst away from the office was also a bonus : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff members found to be very friendly & nice : [u'amenities', u'conference']
In any case, I am not about to find out in my next trip to Bali : []
I would definitely recommend this hotel! : []
Would highly recommend them if you are planning to stay in a big group : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Unfortunately, it's currently under renovation : []
The Premier room was very good indeed: clean and in good condition, comfortable bed, Balinese-style wood furniture and a balcony overlooking the aforementioned garden : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
We had purchased a package through Asian Affair Holidays - an incredible deal : []
The spa section is perfect for people who wanted more solitude and enjoy free sauna, steam, even hot and cold jacuzzi : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We sprang for the extra charge (honeymoon, after all!) to be in the private club wing with concierge services, cocktail receptions, etc, and found it well worth the extra cost : []
Some Danish pastries, pan au chocolat, muffins etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was perfect for us, I had requested a room near the pool with the travel agent and when we checked in I asked if we had been given one : []
Meals are wonderful : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The check-in process was smooth at comfortable, the rooms were very comfortable, the food and drinks were very good, the kids club kept the kids occupied for many hours giving us the chance to enjoy the excellent spa facilities : [u'overall', u'culture']
The rooms are good quality, well maintained, could be more luxurious, but are traditional as opposed to dated : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The place has a great feel and atmosphere, the entrance is grand and the general look of the place is something you'd expect from a classically luxury Resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Gentle, thoughtful and service oriented : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I read some poor reviews : []
so thanks for the beautiful huge birthday cake, flowers and arragement in the room and at Raja's restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We spent the rest of our vacation at the Ritz in Jimbaran : []
I can't remember the name of the spa we used but shop about as prices vary quite a bit and we didn't go for the cheapest, we picked the one that looked most relaxing while still reasonable prices : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are a few restaurants around which are nice too, not much nightlife but Kuta is just down the road : [u'amenities', u'garden']
We recently stayed for 7 days : []
Sprawling hotel complex right on the beach at Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The second time was even better than the first! : [u'location', u'sea']
we ate there 2 nights in a row : []
Absolutely beautiful resort, great room and wonderful staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This Beach Hotel was perfect : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The shower water pressure is a bit weak, but everything else was great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It's nice to have everything you need at the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we loved everything about it and are planning to come back in the very near future : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is a gem of shaded lounges around a lap pool : []
Do not come here alone, as I did! I was here for a convention for a week and felt miserable without my special someone, in such a romantic place : []
Pity that there were construction works by the pool which was noisy at times : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Which I think would put this hotel near the top, but perhaps second tier : []
It was extremely relaxing with plenty of activities if reading by the pool wasn't your thing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
This hotel is your standard beach resort : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our experience was perfect : [u'overall', u'feel']
The hotel was wonderfully caring, I received the visit of the hotel management and some of their very : []
Only lobby and the rooms that are near the lobby can get it : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
The birds and squirrels also steal from the breakfast tables : [u'location', u'forest']
The beach was lovely and staff cleaned the sand daily : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The resort was beautiful and maintained to a very high standard : [u'amenities', u'pool']
A couple of Indian/Mughlai/Chinese dishes in the restaurant's menu would have added to our delightful experience : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We went to the Balinese theatre show and both the food and the entertainment were first class : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Excellent service from the friendly staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I asked for an additional pillow and it smelt of smoke, which was a little off putting : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The whole mood of the place is surreal and pleasant : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
Everything we found there was amazing but, most of all, the unforgettable atmosphere, with tropical flowers and trees everywhere, amazing rooms, fantastically decorated with wood all over and musicians playing the local instruments during breakfast time: a real paradise on earth : []
We had our honeymoon trip to Bali and this was the resort we stayed in : []
But would really like to see #1 improved : []
Food was ok not much vegetarian options : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Shuttle bus to Bali Collection on the hour (other than 5 pm) is well worth the trip, all of 5 mins : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
I would recommend a trip inland to get a real feel for the island - we visited the lake at the volcano, and a spice plantation, and it was fabulous to see the rice terraces/ fields all over the countryside : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We needed a rest and this this resort is a excellent place to rest! The restaurants are excellent! The swimming pool is nice with a bar serving excellent drink : [u'amenities', u'patio']
This is an issue management will have to do something about as we witnessed ALOT of frustrated guests trying to find a spot to sit : []
This was our first time to Bali due to a wedding that we needed to attend to at the Westin : []
It's a good base to explore interesting/authentic parts of Bali : []
We also found that you have to get up REALLY early to reserve a sunbed, many are already taken by 7 : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The Palace Club Ocean View room only has glimpses of the ocean but the room had a separate living and dinning area as well as 2 toilets and a kitchen/storage area and a lovely big long balcony looking over the pond, very nice : [u'location', u'general']
Food and drinks were over priced and disappointing that there was no free wifi to the rooms but only available in the lobby : [u'amenities', u'internet']
But this is greatly let down by the deplorable conditions of the rooms : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
my kids really like the pool and the beach so clean and the breakfast also yummy : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Fantastic place! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Writing this review is a hard one for me because Nusa Dua hotel is not normally the kind of hotel that I would enjoy, however this hotel certainley swayed my opinion in their favour : []
Butler service was very helpful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Upon arriving at Denpasar Airport we were picked up by two friendly staff members from the hotel : []
My husband and I stayed here with our two children aged 10 and 13 years for 1 night with a late check out (6pm) so we had one and a half days that we spent mostly at the hotel except to walk outside the Nusa Dua main gate to eat and shop : []
do not get a taxi from the hotel as you will be charged over the odds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Enjoy your time at the Nusa Dua and Bali! : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
My only down comments would be no iced water in urns at key places ( reception, lobby ) and no body saying about the hidden power points on the side of the room desk by the curtains - only discovered on day 7 : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
This would be one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in : []
The number of pool-side chairs was limited, so we had to get to the pool early to get a place next to the pool with some shade : []
We ate at two of the hotel's many restaurants and enjoyed the meals enormously : []
A day trip was organised through one of the taxi drivers and cost 500 000R for 8 hours, through the hotel it would have cost 800 000R : []
We'd never stay anywhere else : []
The bathroom looked nice but not functional - it was a bath/shower and the water ran out and over the entire floor soaking the matt - there is no glass or curtain as such : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Definitely go back :) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And, it was our first honeymoon trip to Bali which we hope to be a pleasant one! : []
A true Balinese resort - great value for money - pleasing service - good food - lovely pool : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Have been here before 3 yrs ago and wanted to see if everything was still as nice as it was then : []
We used the spa and had a joint scrub and massage treatment which i have to say was just awesome, my husband still can't stop talking about how good it was : []
Nusa Dua is a resort area and I would only stay here if you want to unwind by sitting by the pool and not doing much : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Interior and exterior design with wooden Bali theme makes you feel that you are in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The NDBH & S simply is, as it says, the best of Bali : []
IOverall we felt like we treated as just another number : []
Well working free internet in lobby & pool area : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
And I was talking to other guests at the resort - same problem : []
Thanks also for the management, we received free upgrade from deluxe to club room : []
We visited Nusa Dua centre, Kuta and Jimbaran Bay (which you must visit for the sunset in the evening it is amazing) : []
You cannot swim and surf there, as there are full of algae near to sea shore : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our family of four stayed for ten days at the Nusa Dua in mid January2010 : [u'overall', u'culture']
in the spa - imagine getting a balinese massage listening to jingle bells ??!!! the staff are good but this is the real oddity : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The variety of food on offer is good and we have not been disappointed : []
Most decor n room furnishings are wood crafted : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
Rooms need renovation so small bathrooms no bath tops : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Very clean and comfortable room, great location, lovely restaurants which serve fantastic food, nice and friendly staff : [u'amenities', u'conference']
All the saff are good but we noticed Nula ( Hope I have spelt this right) always seemed genuinly pleased to see us : []
The resort is so peaceful, relaxing and so quiet : [u'amenities', u'pool']
a couple of other tips - if you want a taxi, don't get it from the hotel, just walk out of the front gates and you will have your pick and can negotiate a price before getting in : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff is amazing - friendly, helpful and always very respectful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I didn't mention the breakfast dining - the food was wonderful and there was such a variety : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']

wide selection of cold & hot food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I must say that besides , Westin and Laguna, which also occupied the same stretch of beach , NDBH offered the best beachfront with spotless white sand and most importantly ,a large number of clean beach loungers : []
From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty : []
Reviews are all accurate : [u'amenities', u'internet']
the lap pool which was great for laps as well as relaxing - very few people), spa treatments beautiful : [u'amenities', u'conference']

Conveniently connected to the beach itself is also practical, dining options are plentiful, personnel are attentive, overall most gratifying! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We had stayed at the Bali Mandira and the Bali Hilton prior to the wedding, and preferred both of the those to the NDBH : []
We are return guests, so no option to select that in the survey : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
commend the Resort in general : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Everything was just perfect- beautiful location - v nice restauraunt : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The portion is generous, we shared a portion between 2 of us! : []
Quality of food served in restaurants also good although could be served in a more timely manner : [u'overall', u'safety']
I say cared for because you truly feel that they genuinely do want to give you the best Bali experience ever : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The air conditioning is efficient and quiet : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Rooms are very comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
It should be little bit big with the glass or the curtains long enough to stop the water going outside : []

Everything was clean, location is right on the beach, no real complaints : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
My family ,especially enjoyed the food at Maguro , the Japanese-Asian Restaurant : [u'overall', u'culture']
Smaller and quieter than most family resorts which is great and although Nusa Dua is generally quieter than Kuta & Legian and a bit tucked away, the free shuttle to Bali Collection every hour from 10am to 10pm ,shopping and restaurants are very convenient to access : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights in June 2013 : [u'overall', u'culture']
As our flight home was not until 1 : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub']

The service was excellent and the food was great - incredibly good value for money : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktails at the palace were exceptional : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']

Rather than elbow him in the face a half mile offshore I chose to stop, make him switch places with me, and take me back in : [u'overall', u'culture']
beach at front of hotel is the best place to visit, blue clear water, white sandy beach, a lot of lounges available, clean beach, quiet, so when you fall a sleep you can sleep tight till you awake, great ! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Will definitely return one day and wished we had booked for a few nights more : []
We spent most of the time on the beach and in the sea : []

Plusses were: Comfortable beds, good breakfast, good and many restaurants,large pools, fine garden, nice setting by the sea : [u'location', u'sea']
Very few families with children and not the 'mass resort' that I feared from some reviews : []

The hotel should offer evening entertainment : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I could not use a Deluxe Room for four persons which I reserved online, because the hotel allowed the previous guests to still occupy it : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I hunted around and saw it next to a pillar with no one near it : []
Overall amazing experience! I would stay there again in a second! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Look out for three roving musicians we affectionately dubbed 'The Three Amigos' - they will sing you your favourite song in three part harmony and are really friendly, talented guys : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We couldn't pick a favourite amongst them as they all offer excellent cuisine : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The only thing bothered us was the moldy smell due to the rainy season? i don't think there was anything they could do about it as a 5- star hotel? Besides that, everything else was terrific!! good service and all : []
They have a happy hour from 5 till 7 pm near the pools : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Has kids menu so i I don't have to order adult portion for my kids : []

The entrance says it all : []
Me and my wife had a great time in this hotel : []
The balconies and furniture are run down and dirty; you are plonked on top of neighbours; staff come crawling up the side of the building and onto your balcony to water plants : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had no choice but to be near the hotel because our toddler had to nap : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']

Try the seafood BBQ it has a great variety and also has good vegetarian choice which some of us are : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I booked the premier room for 2 nights for a trip with my partner : []
Afternoon tea everyday is fantastic, and evening cocktales are great! The price of alcohol has gone up in Bali so free cocktales and canapes for 1 hour and a half hours is great value! This hotel is as good as it gets, nowhere else compares : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There is an hourly free mini bus but was often full or a ten minute walk or taxi : [u'location', u'airport', u'station']
Also some more food attendees : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

Great hotel, both at the business meeting (I was with a group of 50 people) and private : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Room itself was fantastic, but balcony was grotty and bathroom was shocking! Smelt of draibs &?sewage and shower had mould everywhere : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
the only thing i would recommend better aircon and a coffee machine I hate creamer : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I've traveled the world and stayed in all sorts of Hotels/Resorts and I can not fault this beautiful Hotel : []
The spa treatment was so relaxing and luxuriating : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
I must say the staff made every attempt to get it working, but it never was right, leaving sleeping impossible : []
Superb facilities for resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']

We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 5 nights at the end of June : []
We stayed in a nice room - which didn't have a view of the beach, however, unless you went out onto the balcony and twisted your neck around!!! There were renovations going on in some parts - the noise wasn't too bad, but we were aware of them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed in this hotel for 3 days following a cruise : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
30 am for an excursion and many loungers had towells on at this time!! Any way our prefernce is for the beach, where the smiley and attentive staff are happy to bring you drink and food while you have a good chat with the beach sellers : []
A beautiful, relaxing holiday and I can't wait to return : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Will definitely be going back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We didn't think much about it, since he always did this with any crib he's in : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
(It had at least 20 rooms and its own private pool : []
We even walked through the other resorts that are adjacent to ours along the beach and in terms of pool space and beach lounging, none of them compared! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were really able to unwind and enjoy ourselves in Nusa Dua : []
The hotel also offers guests free daytime activities - we actually really enjoyed carving flowers and leaves out of vegetables, and the trial scuba dive in the pool an interesting experience : []
I had better experience staying in a hotel far below nusa dua beach and spa in reputation : [u'overall', u'culture']
The staff is extremely friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
My only complaint of the hotel is that internet use -- only lobby has free wifi facility and all the rooms have a wire connection : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Mall/resto area a 10minute walk away from hotel on main road of Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Our room was great, very spacious and comfortable with two TVs and two bathrooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort for 7 nights : []
This holiday i booked 2 times 3 nights here and both times it was a pleasure to stay in this beautiful hotel : []
Although we start off on the wrong foot with the hotel experience, our overall experience with them was great : [u'overall', u'feel']
Security is very tight at the entrance to the Nusa Dua area, which serve to remind the Bali bombing :( There are few hotels in the area : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I have not got much more else to say but I have to fill the characters to submit this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We wanted to stay in the Nusa Dua area and this one seemed to be one of the better value for money ones : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We recently stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort and had 4 nights there : []
To sit by the pool listening to drills and work 10-20 foot away, very unenjoyable : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The lounge in the hotel is also very good although the prices are a bit high and the white wine pour couldn't have been more than 4 ounces : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The lady didn't like it that I didn't want to buy a sarong from her, I suppose : []
Staff were very friendly, & helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We even didn't even venture out as often as we had planned because we were so content here : []
Simply stunning open air feel lobby with authentic Bali statues and gardens : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We had sea view, a beautiful balcony and much, much more : [u'room-experience', u'view']
Kind Regards : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are cleaned and tidied properly every day, they really were spotless, and for us it was truly lovely that the person from housekeeping who did our turndown each evening remembered our name and which room we were in wherever he saw us in the hotel and always had a cheery word : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We stayed at this resort from July 2 until July 6 : []
Referring to my previous report, this hotel just keeps delivering : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Pool Bar attendant - Mushadi - is a gem and it is no surprise that he has been with Nusa Dua for many years : [u'location', u'sea']
Buffets were cool and breakfast was always filling! Spa was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
It has everything that you need : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
only the beach gets a lot of seaweed and is not really suitable for swimming : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
it was booked as an add on package to a cruise : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The grounds were beautiful & spotless : [u'overall', u'safety']
I strongly recommend the resort to all : []
I can only recommend this property : []
they are trying to make a turistic area wich seems unnatural regarding the context of Bali : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
Swamped with annoying service as there were very few other customers & staff felt they should look busy, but were continually asked "how were things?" etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room was nice although the bed needs to be replaced - had we stayed longer than one night we may have asked to change rooms due to the bed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
and simply never really made 3/4 of our list : [u'location', u'sea']
The spa is awesome and entirely relaxing with a lovely pool that is refreshing in the shade : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is nice, has huge, clean and beautiful swimming pools : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It has been very well maintained and the established gardens are beautiful : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Nice restaurants (I recommend the Raja for Balinese food and the Italian for very tasty pizzas) - you can eat in front of the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Proximity to Bali Collection is a short walk , there are also bicycles to hire at the Spa : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
You are treated like royalty from the minute you arrive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff at the Information desk, (just a few metres away), however, were always helpful and would try their best with all of our enquiries : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This trip we got back to our room one day to find it double locked - we couldn't get in : []
Language was a slight problem here but it didn't seem to matter : []
Its location is fantastic : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We were not disappointed : []
The location is perfect- right on the beach ( also gorgeous!) with well furnished rooms and plenty of facilities : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
As is located a distance between the city is best to just stay in the hotel and enjoy all the felicities the hotel had to offer : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There are plenty of places to eat but special mention goes to the breakfast buffet : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The area of Nusa Dua is only 5* hotels and its a beautiful area absolutely neat & clean, private and away from the hustle bustle of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak : [u'location', u'general']
Restaurants include Italian, Indonesian and Asian, also one right on the beach with beautiful sea views : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Even though its wet season, we experienced sunny weather with only minutes of rain towards the afternoon or very late at night : []
They all overlook the magnificent gardens, which are beautifully manicured and taken care of : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Staff are very friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We used the drivers from the resort and they were fabulous, very knowledgeable and we felt in safe hands with them : []
- there are lots of activities going on : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool area was always busy but never felt busy : [u'location', u'general']
We went for the water aerobics which was fun! tried our hands on making festive hangings with coconut leaves : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We enjoyed though :) : []
THE swimming pool was amazing me and my family spend allot of hours there swimming, they have so many activities around the pool area and the pool it self : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The areas around the pools were not cleaned regularly, a straw and a slice of lemon that feel onto the floor from my drink on the first afternoon was still there the following two days! Next tim,e I will go back to the Laguna or the Westin : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We had access to the private beach and few restaurants located inside the hotel : []
After taking a shower most of the Bathroom floor is completly wet : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
The resort gardens were always tidy : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Hard to find a beach chair : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Do not miss on the banana & bread pudding and all berry dessert : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This would be much easier for all by offering a small buffet, like nice cheese, fruit and maybe one hot dish instead of offering the small plates : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is unique to indonesia and this depicts the yin-yang theory of life : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A must do : []
However, even the "better" room was not great, and having stayed at about 15 different hotels all over Bali, we know you can get better value at this price point : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Need more cupboard space in the bathroom : [u'overall', u'spacious']
I cannot recommend this hotel enough to people as it is world class : []
Excellent location for beach, well maintained property : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The grounds are so peaceful and well maintained : [u'overall', u'safety']
The facilities were great and the staff could not have been more helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']

Older people find it difficult to climb into a bath to shower : []
At each of these the food was faultless : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We stayed at Nusa Dua beach hotel for a week with our 2 year old son : []
The ladies at the Spa are lovely - the Spa itself - I couldn't rate it more than 3 : []
My husband and I stayed in a standard room for 8 nights : [u'overall', u'culture']
I was treated for a fee which was reasonable and which I can claim in travel insurance (don't leave home without it) : []
Caused be the amount of people, after first use of the table, the table is not cleanded in the way you will expect it for a hotel like this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Travel cost to Baiseki Temple USD 70 per person was very expensive, on the other hand other were offering UD 70 for 3 people : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
For a hotel that has been around for more than 30 years, the condition was very good : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
if you stay at the hotel the resturaunts are all lovley chess is the one on the beachfront with the amazing buffet : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Amazing value : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However on the beach there are locals trying to sell you bali items (ei: sarongs, shells, tourist attraction services) - they can be a annoying especially if you want to relax : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a few evening meals in the resort however we had a bad experience on every occasion which was probably "the luck of the draw" but these experiences didn't fill us with confidence for eating in the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
I didn't feel like stepping out of the hotel at all!! : []
Maybe I'm not the target audience for this kind of place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We did use room service several times and found the kids menu to be very good with well sized portions : []
These things didn't spoil our experience, because everything they didn't offer the local shops and restaurants did : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The treatment here is excellent : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
The only drawback was the shower : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The sea however, because protected by a reef is very shallow and the bottom not very pleasant to walk on but, the hotel pools more than made up for this : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
One more thing, the food/drink price is quite expensive for my side, so either you manage to brought it from the outside, or bring extra cash (maybe this is how they maintain the taste afterall) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We would rate it 4 : []
As a traveler that is in a hotel about 150 nights a year - this is a wonderful place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall, a good hotel but nothing extraordinary : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

I took the Delux Spa Package which gave me a deluxe room, spa treatment of one hour which was divine and return airport transfers : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Nusa Dua Beach and Spa hotel must be the best place to stay in the whole of Indonesia : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The papaya juice and the bread pudding is my favorite : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
20:30 ish nice quiet night cap at the lobby bar (happy hour 21:00 - 01:00 : [u'amenities', u'patio']
It would be great if they have a bath tub : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel was nice especially the lobby area and the restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Regarding Nusa Dua in general (and not the hotel), during the day and travelling by taxi it took almost an hour to get to Kuta, and nearly two hours to get to Ubud, so if you want to get out and about in Bali most days then this should be considered : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall I would highly recommend this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Rooms are comfy and large : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I like the back garden at the beach side : []
A fantastic place for romance, a fantastic place for families and a fantastic place to wind down : [u'overall', u'culture']

In all aspects, a hotel with more than worthed four stars : [u'overall', u'culture']
it was quiet at night and we tended to sit at the bar enjoying the sea breeze, slipping drinks and listening to live band : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The squirrels were funny : [u'amenities', u'garden']

The resort itself is lovely with nice pools and a swim up bar : [u'amenities', u'pool']

We walked down the beach and checked out other hotels on our first day and were happy to have chosen the Nusa Dua each Hotel and Spa : []
I don't want a concrete jungle in the pool areas : []
There are many pura and idols on-site (can't be helped I guess since it's Bali after all) : []
This not this hotel did not exceed to my expectations : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed at Nusa Dua for 3 nights, In October 2013 with our 2 children aged 6 and 2 : []
Overall we had a wonderful trip and left with wonderful memories of Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']

They both enjoyed feeding the fishes, squirrels, birds, ducks : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The atmosphere at the beach was very calm and relaxing : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
We stayed for 10 days as part of a luxury deal offer which was great value, however what was not mentioned in the deal was the fact that your meal selection for lunch and dinner was cut down to a third of the menu on purchasing, which was extremely limiting and repetitive, especially over a 10 day period : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Our room was immaculate and nothing was too much trouble from bringing us some ice or requesting an extra towel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room was big on a higher floor : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

The breakfast buffet is amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Our room was lovely, we were supposed to be upgraded to a Premier room with a separate sitting area, but our room did not have this : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

Chose this hotel based on the good reviews on TA and also because they had a suitable room configuration for us : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We were only staying in the deluxe rooms which more than catered for our requirements : [u'amenities', u'conference']
good restaurants however Sandros Italian restaurant was disappointing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

She didn't seem to want to learn as it was same the next show : []
Do not expect the service desk to be anything like the service desk at a top rated hotel in Jakarta, or Manila, or Hong Kong : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']

Great hotel with many options : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My wife and I visited the spa and had a Balinese massage : [u'overall', u'culture']
but take one from outside hotel, as hotel adds a large surcharge if booked with them : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
the room was clean, the bed was extremely comfortable (me & my husband literally wanted to steal the pillows), washroom was small but comfortable : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
We stayed at Nusa Dua recently and found the service shocking for the amount we paid : []
prior to our arrival and everything went to schedule : [u'amenities', u'banquet']

Staff Very welcoming : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']

Our recent stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was very relaxing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We booked this hotel through Expedia and booked a dearer Premier room with a pool view : []
Pools are nice and clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
"Where Kings and Presidents stay" truly indicates the high quality of this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
:D but it's take a long walk to arrive to our room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
If you head out to the path and turn right towards the park with the big statue it's a 10 minute walk to the Nusa Dua Shopping and entertainment complex, here you'll find lots of shops, including a chemist, department store and a large number of restaurants if you'd like somewhere a bit cheaper then the hotel to eat : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was my first stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel , we stayed in a Palace Club room, which I have to say is worth the extra cost : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Because I stayed there for 5 days, and their breakfast buffet is the same for the entire 5 days : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Palace lounge club staff were exceptional, however I have to agree with the other reviewer, on a couple of occasions service of drinks was pretty slow, you had to wonder why : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We enjoyed the breakfast as plenty of choice so you can have a different style breakfast everyday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The landscape was lush and peaceful; there were small stone statues placed in the water and a couple of small bridges : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
So there was some construction noise in the morning : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
A supermarket which was handy to stock up on bottled water and bits n pieces : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Obviously, some rooms are going to be more luxurious than others, and some of the rooms that opened onto garden patios looked especially inviting : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Overall I had a wonderful experience at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, the rooms and grounds are wonderful, and it was fantastic to have a private beach! : []
Even though we were at the hotel during a very quite time, it was hard to get onto a computer : []
Naturally there was only one place we would stay : []
its was have a nice days stay there although only 1 night but feeling cozy around : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My partner and I stayed at this beautiful resort from 7 to 16 June 2013 : [u'overall', u'culture']
The kids had a great time at the hotel as did my husband and I : [u'overall', u'culture']
Although, it is 30 years old, it doesn't show its age as some reviews stated : []
Overall a great place would go again if not staying in Legian : []
Lovely hotel and definately worth booking the palace club rooms : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
This excellent service made our holiday worry free and even more enjoyable : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The pool is the stand out feature : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The best sleep I have had on a holiday : []
It's very large but I don't notice it except sometimes it is very busy at breakfast! It's the first hotel in this area & still reigns supreme for me! The spa does need new free weights & I know they are going to replace the old flooring : []
My husband and I visited here on our honeymoon in 2011 : [u'overall', u'culture']
The ladies are very professional and the rooms are very clean and nicely decorated you feel very relaxed after ther treatment : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
He said" You insisted on a non smoking room" I asked if non smokers were penalized : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I would recommend a stay if in the Nusa Dua area, a much quieter experience than the Kuta/Legian areas : []
* food was incredible at restaurants especially at the Raja's and the Maguro : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
When we arrived we were delighted that our room was upgraded to a suite : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

This hotel are located on a very good beach area long side with other 5 stars hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
In comparison to Aust it was cheap however we still all go to Bali to save some $$ on a cheaper holiday : []
Rooms were spacious : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
It was so minimalist, yet still comfort enough to use and clean : []
The gardens are beautiful : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Was well worth the 16 hour flight, hotel was very clean, absaloutly massive, they put us in a room near the spa, We are beach and pool lovers so asked to move closer and was a bit embarrassed about asking but they had no problem with our request so helpful, the 2nd room was perfect for us : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
This is our first time visit to the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On this trip to Bali we decided that we wanted to be away from the hustle and bustle and the hotel is the perfect location for that : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The rooms were clean and comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The hotel located in secure area call Nusa Dua, surrounded by a few 5 stars hotel, but the enterance security people who checking the guest (and car) sometimes overacting, especially if there is a coference running in that area, so be ready you must wait to be checked everytime you enter this area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very appreciated considering my partner is struggling after illness and uses a walking stick : [u'overall', u'culture']
The breakfast buffet was extremely good as were the eggs to order and the setting by the pond was gorgeous : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The restaurants at the hotel were all lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
There is also variety of food and dining options along with theme nights so no real need to leave if you desire : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We booked this Hotel again based on our wonderful stay 5 years ago and we were not disappointed : []
Totally clean and no hassle from hawkers : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The staff are excellent and are always willing to assist and serve the guests : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had dinner once at the Asian restaurant which is quite upmarket yet we were made to feel very comfortable and relaxed with an excellent meal and wine : []
We spoke to other guests who ate lunch/ dinner at neighbouring hotels : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The only slight annoyance was the 21% tax on top of the already "not cheap by Bali standards" price of food and drinks : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We choose -one evening -a very nice restaurant on the beach of Jimbaran where we watched the sunset and enjoyed a great dinner, named " Sea Side Cafe" : []
First of all the staff is very kind, polite and really helpful : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The restaurants have good food, but wow are they expensive!! You should definitely go eat at "Bali Collection", which is a 20 minute walk away (or free shuttle every hour from hotel) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
a grace resort because well maintained garden and building : [u'amenities', u'pool']
She was briiliant on any other way during our stay (6 nights) in the hotel and she organised a unforgettable wedding for us : [u'overall', u'culture']
The same staff were there 9 yrs on, the diference is the buffets have gone to a fully serviced breakfast and help yourself to the parties and fruit : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We had just come from the Ayana hotel so any other hotel would have a lot to live up to : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I do not recommend attending this excursion alone for women : []
If you are arriving in Bali on a late flight and want a couple of nights to settle in before heading north it's perfect : []
we had breakfast every day overlooking a pond and gardens : []
From the moment we arrived at reception the Hotel had a great feel about it : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
No disruptions & noises at all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Stayed here 24th to 31st May 2015 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There names were Novi where we had a beautiful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We tried to use the squash court but then they tried to charge us $12 U : []
Considering that both the Hilton and the Mandira were cheaper, we felt really let down, having spent more money on what we thought would be the better hotel for our honeymoon : []
Considering all of the changes we needed to make to the menus (due to 2 in our party being fussy eaters) and my indecision on just about everything, they were amazingly efficient and everything went like clock work : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The main pool, with its swim up bar, got plenty of use, and there is another 'lagoon' pool which is shallow enough for kids of all ages : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The pool area gets packed quickly, so getting there early is a good tip, while the afternoon seems to fizzle out, more pool chairs become available : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This survey on the other hand is very annoying forcing people to write something : [u'location', u'sea']
The hotel had numerous restaurants , we tried them all and couldn't fault anything : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Will be staying for 3rd time in June! Can't rate it highly enough : [u'location', u'sea']
I was really surprised by the negative reviews on TripAdvisor for this property : []
All amenities are top notch:-food & drinks, entertainment, activites for all,spa & sports facilities,private beach no hassles : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We found NDBH a great place to visit and stay : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I'll just go to spa : []
We enjoyed 10 relaxing days and would recommend a stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
Thankyou so much! : []
But in them we found sea urchins, star fish and all sorts of critters : []
One large bintang and a vodka & orange being $20 aus (before the ++ tax) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Our only suggestions for improvement is for the food delivered must match the description as on occasion components of the meal did not arrive, eg pizza delivered wasn't as ordered, minor ingredients missing, drinks ordered never came, wait times occasionally seemed out of sync with the number of patrons : [u'location', u'sea']
I am also pleased to report that we came away with zero mosquito bites - a small thing, perhaps, but we have stayed at other resorts where we ended up scratching our arms and legs for a week after we got home : []
I loved it very much and came back 2-3 times after that : []
The privacy was fantastic : [u'room-experience', u'privacy']
This also means it is one of the oldest and a few years back may have become a bit dated and in need of a freshening up : [u'location', u'sea']
They have good quality of bread and good coffee : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
As with all resorts in bali/asia, some work on some reasonably priced quality wine would be a be godsend : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa is by far the worst of the them : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The best meals we had were at Ikan in the Westin resort next door : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Plenty of restaurants and bars on the grounds - can be expensive eating there though : [u'overall', u'safety']
The pools are stunning : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
for example only 3 darts in total and of of different size and makes : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Thank you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for opening our eyes to a different side of Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bali Collection was a shopping mall with lots of good restaurants, and it was only 5 minutes away from the hotel : []
Great deal, Great place, rarely left resort : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The food at the couple of restaurants was very yum and affordable : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Not pleased with it AT ALL : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Great big bath as well : []
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is one of the original resorts built in the Nusa Dua part of Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Evening coctails (2) each and appys (6) were some of the best I have had in a long time : []
Top tip - don't get a taxi from the hotel just walk outside the security gates and there's loads there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Overall, it was a pleasant stay at the hotel : []
We used this for our lunch and dinner as the food and drinks here in the hotel are rather expensive : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
In contrast the Nusa dua beach hotel architecture makes you feel like your in your own little balinese kingdom : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were there for 5 days and would have loved to stay a few more days : []
The breakfast buffet had an exellent spread with western and eastern cuisine : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Our room was spacious and clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
At other times , we also took a shuttle bus to Bali Collection for our shopping needs and dinner as well : []
It was peaceful and relaxing- just what we wanted : []
The hotel was immaculately kept and it was quiet and serene everywhere you went : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They were both the same price R325K (ex service charge & tax) per adult, half price for children : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Who would want to spend 7 nights eating only hotel food? Staff are permitted to help you get to where you want to go if you know where you want to get to! So, exit the hotel at beach front and walk 10 mins to the right : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The walk to the shoreline is short but fairly steep and the presence of a reef close to shore means that you can paddle in the ocean but a proper swim is not really an option : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Set right on the beach, a very relaxing place to stay! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The service was generally friendly and efficient, but was somewhat disjointed at times, possibly because some of the staff were somewhat limited in English : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
BUT, I also have to say that this resort has one of the best customer relation services I've seen : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
beautiful resort, always friendly excellent service, Nick had an allergic reation to something (nothing to do with the resort) They had a doctor to him within 15 minutes at 5 : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
An English speaking driver came to pick up and we went to the Hotel through newly constructed way : []
He calls himself the general manager and lacks any ability and sensitivity how to handle a customer : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Beach was beautiful and relaxing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The place where you eat breakfast was wonderful : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This is full of restaurants - cheap cheap, lots of shopping, spa treatment shops, money exchange booths, entertainment : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room is great with breathtaking garden view : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Went back 20 mins later to inform the guy we were going to get lunch in the resort and the guy didn't remember me : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The breakfast is very average and two fans in the restaurant area are missing bare wires showing (not a good look for a supposedly top rated hotel : [u'amenities', u'patio']
However, this is a typical international luxury hotel with no soul : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This means you are a little captive to resort prices : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
HIGHLY RECOMMEND ***** : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The seafood was much better value- it included lobster and fillet steak, which were excellent : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We found the food bland and disappointing : []
He actually stood there with his hands on his hips, let out an exasperated sigh and then shook his head in disbelief that this imbecile of a tourist couldn't remember everything in one go : []
I was at the Nusa Dua for a conference, for some days : []
It was a little pricey but totally worth it : []
This is a wonderful place to relax in and chill out : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Palace Club rooms are on the ground floor, and the first impression you get walking in was the smell of dampness : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The next time we stay at the hotel we will definitely stay in the palace club rooms as this area looked a lot more inviting for a couple : [u'location', u'general']
It's an older hotel with so much charm and beauty : []
we in join stay in this hotel from day one : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Room: The room was an average size, clean and tidy with a small balcony, small bathroom, shower but no bath : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Great for a weekend getaway and some relaxation time : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Great service and nice rooms : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Compliments the Management and Staff of the Nus Dua Hotel and Spa, on their effeciently run hotel and wonderful friendly service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Pros:- The friendliest staff we have ever seen : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I really appreciate how they have built this place to be "open air" - the main lobby, the walkways to/from the rooms, the restaurants : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
This was our third visit to this lovely hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also a big thankyou to the Manager URS KLEE : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Hotel staff are very welcoming, it was our second time at the Hotel : []
They are happy to assist you with any request, and a really obliging : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone : []
We used the Spa, the gym and also took yoga classes, all very relaxing and fun : []
The second room was a bit better but really, only just : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The disappointment for me was that by 8 pm there was nothing happening : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We felt very bitter and cheated when we realised that each time you ask them to call you a cab they give you their hotel taxi which charges a ridiculous fare - for the same type of car or driver of a regular taxi!!! I am surprised that nobody has picked up on this : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The Spa facilities and lap pool were perfect providing a peaceful environment : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I travel to nusa Dua every six months and can honestly say that out of my past stays in various hotels, I shall be returning to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel from now on : []
Thankfully it turned out to be a couple of women in the spa as the alternative would make me feel uncomfortable : []
The grounds are very beautiful and the staff very accomodating : [u'overall', u'safety']
The hotel is well maintained and the gardens are stunning : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Food is a bit pricey but what do you expect from a 5 star resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I was a bit disapointed witht the beach as it looked pretty rocky and there were warning signs about sea urchins so I stayed away : []
Dinner on the first night was on the open veranda, kept cool by rotating fans overhead : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Beautifullly respectful staff, gorgeous tropical gardens, pools to dies for and a resort with a mixture of old Balinese style and beachy new paradise : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
What made my stay so special was the staff and management : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For few nights for pure relax its a good place but not for long stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The bathrooms are not very large, but well designed, the lavatory pan is modern, and the large rock tiled floors and rain shower add up to a beautiful and unique feel of paradise : [u'location', u'sea']
All in all, it just left a bad taste in my mouth at a fairly high cost : []
Breakfast was buffet style : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
However, I find it to be quite charming because it also has the most character : []
Great resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We did take one bottle of water from the mini bar and had to pay 75 : []
My cousin and I had a marvelous time : [u'location', u'sea']
The bed was way too firm for me, so I slept on a down pillow every night : []
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is without a doubt the best holiday I've ever had : []
The included breakfast buffet was awesome! We stayed in room 3131 and had spectacular resort and ocean views : [u'amenities', u'conference']
whilst travelling round Bali and Lombok : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
it's rally worth every cent you sent for it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall, it was definitely a good stay and we will come back again : []
One of the best we have stayed in : []
After many different maintenace men coming into the room and not understanding finally at midnight a Manager came and realised it was broken and had it replaced but it had completely ruined my night as I could not relax and I was very upset as this was not the first time I spent hours sorting out maintenance issues : []
Wireless works basically only in lobby : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
The noise was more evident when the balcony doors were open : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Food very nice too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You can get cheaper prices outside the hotel but these often do not include the entrance fees or a guide and the driver will try to take you to places where they get commission : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There was lots of choice for restaurants and the food was good : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The service was also not very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Highly recommend to anyone on their honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
The staff would always greeted us with a smile and were very helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
They had two Chefs who would make you an omelette of your choice, they had a huge selection of cereals, breads, Indonesian food (rice, curries, fish, noodles) and a huge range of Western foods (eggs, bacon, sausages, hash browns, tomatoes, mushrooms, pancakes, waffles) etc : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Check-in: 19 April 2015 : [u'location', u'sea']
The hotel itself has beautiful, luscious grounds which are well laid out and relaxing : [u'amenities', u'conference']
If you miss the bus, the walk is short : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in and the staff are brilliant : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This is sadly so often not the case with a lot of the new properties which crop up which seem sterile, stifling and lifeless : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Pool area was lovey and direct access to the beach! : [u'location', u'general']
Other resaurants on site were ok, nothing special but adequate : []
The service is first class and the location excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The first 48hours room internet is free : [u'amenities', u'internet']
No bath tub in Deluxe room, but I can live with this : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub']
As we were getting married in the hotel, we had booked our second week in a Palace Club room, but luckily for us we were given an upgrade to a Palace Club Suite : []
This hotel was the 5th hotel I stayed at in 3 weeks (due to am unforseen event extending my stay) so I am comparing this hotel against The W, Kajane, Dyana Villas and the Sheraton : []
00 for ten-minute drive : [u'amenities', u'garden']
(Eg Hotel taxi to Nikko Hotel 50000 IRP, Bluebird back 20000 IRP : []
The staff at the Palace Club Lounge were really helpful and friendly, especially Gin and Suni, thank you : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There is the Bali Collection about a 15 minute walk away, a mall for tourists with restaurants and shops : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Excellent Balinese food with a twist : [u'overall', u'culture']
it was our 5 stay and will not be the last the hotel and grounds where perfect but the staff where even better its like our second home : []
The staff overall were brilliant & I can't speak highly enough of them : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
A quick check with Tripadvisor confirmed his opinions of the place : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Maybe collection of unused towels more often would allow others to use facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We very much enjoyed the spa, theme dinners and performances : []
My husband and I enjoyed our first trip to Bali and staying at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa made it very memorable : []
In the hotel, we were welcomed in quickly and very courteously : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There was a Bali Collection Shopping Precinct which was a short stroll up the road (less than 10 minutes) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The breakfasts were probably the best buffet breakfast assortment I have ever experienced and a real highlight : []
We visited in the rainy season (although it barely rained) and there were a fair few mosquitoes in the evening so take some insect repellent : [u'location', u'forest']
The resort is older than others in Nusa Dua but beautifully maintained : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Which i have to say we had but i was totally disappointed in the lack of professionalism within the food and beverage departments within the hotel : []
A+++ : []
Overall it was very good except the food from the room service menu : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Hopefully, one day will return : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Skip it, pay the extra money and stay somewhere else in Nusa or better yet Jinparan or Sanur : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We also managed to visit Ayana and if Ayana in Jimbaran Bay is a five star resort, then Nusa Dua Beach hotel is a 3 star at best! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The pools were great and our son spent most of the day in one or the other! but the relaxing atmosphere was interupted at 11am each morning by loud 'Euro Pop' for the Aqua Aerobicss followed by volleyball!! I used the spa and had a lovely treatment : [u'overall', u'culture']
So they were good, but not great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also tried the salmon teriyaki which was yummy too : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Staff were lovely and always helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There are exclusions and rules not spelt out in the ad when you purchase it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The bathroom although a little tired was more than adequate and suited us fine : []
The food itself was good quality and not overly expensive considering the hotel is 5 stars : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The cost of food and drink was the highest I have ever seen in Asia : []
They work long hours but are always friendly and really want to help : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There were some good things and bad, in my honest opinion the good parts were the beach on the doorstep, a good deep pool and an overall well presented grounds : []
The rooms were clean, but not fancy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Never slept better! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach and pools were perfectly maintained : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The staff also don't smile very much or talk to you, not very inviting : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Half the hotel is under construction and our room faced it all : []
The staff were friendly, food was great, accomodation excellent and immaculately clean, beach clean and secure for children, there are three large pools that the kids visited daily : [u'overall', u'culture']
The management also do a fabulous job of making guests feel very special : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Deeka put in a lot of efforts to make sure it happened properly : []
But if you want a luxury stay, I would say give this place a miss : []
To a construction site and the A/C was leaking water : [u'amenities', u'pool']
A very nice getaway for 2 nights, we really enjoyed our stay at this resort : []
But if you are looking for relaxation then the hotel is great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I look forward to a return visit : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'others']
What an amazing, beautiful place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On the plus side, staff were friendly - as they seem always to be in Bali : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The food at the theme dinners was average : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
I can say we will definitely be returning in the very near future : []
The water sports such as scuba diving, paddle boarding is so : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling']
The hotel and hotel staff were incredible : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The cleaning of the room was terrible : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
The spa did massages however, my daughter and I need sports type not the fairy finger relaxation massage's on offer : [u'overall', u'culture']
Morning "health" drinks served along beach walk : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Overall great location friendly staff great service spa area and staff were great however some areas were a little outdated and in need of an update also perhaps somewhere to hang your wet clothes on outside on the balconies would be good : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Every other hotel I have stayed at included free WIFI and believe it or not, even when you are on holiday away from reality, internet is still considered essential for staying connected : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Great for our young kiddies : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a wonderful holiday and didn't need to leave the resort they had everything we could need right there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Recommend to others: Yes : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I have travelled to Bali 15 times, and on this trip had just been wowed once more by the two other excellent 4-5 hotels I stayed previous to my arrival at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, it was a shock to have so many things be of poor standard at one hotel, Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Check-in via Palace Club was seamless and staff were fantastic : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I could't lie down while watching the TV in the bedroom because of how its installed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
It's certainly not like the western style modern hotels down the road in Nusa Dua : []
Can swim in the pools or the ocean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I chose this hotel after a lot of research and would say that this was the best hotel one can ever experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I advised the announcer lady to tell a sentence of what is going to happen in next 5-10mins every 10mins, which would greatly help our understanding : [u'amenities', u'conference']
All in all the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa is a nice place for a relaxing holiday but is not the best hotel I've ever stayed in : []
Tad disappointed at that : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The gardens are beautiful and well-kept (you have to see them for yourself to fully appreciate how lush and colorful they are) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The only negative is there is no WiFi in the room but it is very comfortable in the lobby bar where free WiFi is available and enjoy a cocktail or two : [u'amenities', u'internet']
I would like to thank Peter Scholz (resident manager) and the staff for a most enjoyable stay in Nusa Dua : []
Semenyak (is that right??) is a cool place as well and another $10 will get you there as well, great for sunsets as is Jimbiran Bay : []
Great pool areas and a wonderful spa retreat : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
thanks for a great holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The restaurants were great, the beach was absolutely lovely with plenty of beach lounges available : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The other pools were all gorgeous and we didn't ever have a problem getting a sunbed : []
The whole hotel has lots of different bits and pieces such as amazing pots and structures that remind you where you are, we find that very pleasant : []
Nusa Dua is a great location if you want to be away from the shopping/tourists/nightlife of Kuta or Seminyak : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great hotel and great for kids, service a little slow in palace club lounge sometimes but otherwise very friendly and helpful, had a lovely stay, got the luxury escape price but don't think its worth over $6000 for the standard price : [u'overall', u'culture']
From the moment we arrived with a cool towel and a complementary welcome drink me and my wife felt relaxed : [u'overall', u'culture']
Nusa Dua is the nicest area, we walked around and we think Nusa Dua Beach is the best, most beautiful and less crowded hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The large scale of the resort means it's not incredibly private, and it can be difficult to find a chair at the pool or beach : []
Went to all the Bali dance shows the fire one was most popular but also shortest : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This is a place for easy morning walks, calm beach waters and a quiet time in general : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Would love to go back again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I can understand not rolling it out to rooms, but would have thought that they could put wifi access points in each bar - in today's world where we rely on internet connectivity, it is an easy thing for the hotel to improve : []
My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 5 days : [u'overall', u'culture']
First off it is US$100 a night cheaper than the Westin and has much more character : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Surrounding of the hotel: : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel staff were waiting for us when we cleared customs, so from that point on everything was wonderful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is a plus in my book : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach was clean with plenty of lounge chairs for everyone and good service for icy cold drinks : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We were given a complimentary massage in the Spa and this was just the ticket for de stressing : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We would defiantly return and plan too sooner rather than later : []
I'd like to recommend this hotel especially for those who want to look for, to stay at hotel with balinese designs and to enjoy the ambience of such environment as well : [u'amenities', u'patio']
You also dont see many other people as most people have standard rooms : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Deeka was outstanding : []
Came here for 4 days : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The room was great, everything worked and was really clean, yet lots of reviews comment on the cleanliness we found this was not an issue : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So many thanks for another unforgettable holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
You are limited to the resorts so prices are a little more : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There are 6 restaurants to choose from each serving good quality food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We were so relaxed here that we ended up missing our flights back! The hotel were (Guest Relations) were kind enough to help out wherever they could when we were having to check out at speed : []
Apparently Nusa Dua Beach is higher than the other three hotels to the South : [u'location', u'general']
I was told that someone on another floor must have pushed the button : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Travel safe : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'others']

Well done by everyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

My big family (all 20 of us) came on Friday afternoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
ARAL fammily istanbul Turkey : []
I recommend this place to families : []
Beach is not good for swimming, lots of see weed : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
They have 2 main swimming pool, one is the standard square-like pool, and the others is beach-like pool who had sandy beach side at the edge of the pool : [u'amenities', u'patio']
nice place to stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall, this holiday was like paradise and holds some very special memories for us : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Staff were always on hand to refill your cup with tea or coffee or just remove any used dishes : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Beautiful setting down in the gardens : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Breakfast is awesum, Overall it was a wonderful experience and without any hesitation i would strongly recommend this hotel : []
The outside verandah is showing a lot of wear and could do with a good water blast : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Truly good and also very good value for money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
nice people, nice country, nice hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Since the weather is cold breeze windy in the morning, we decided not to swim at the sea to keep our son cold : []
Premium level rooms were big enough and rooms were clean and tidy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One of the best hotel in my life : [u'overall', u'culture']
Staff were very friendly and helpful and the general atmosphere is one of welcome and calmness : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
Luckily, the second person was very fast and professional in handling the booking and made me feel welcomed : []
not a single negative thing to say about the place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We ate almost every night at the resort, probably a bit expensive but well worth it for good quality food : []
Happy for anyone to contact me with any queries : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
This is our first trip in Bali, we happened to get the package from Luxury Escapes : []
We ate there twice and truly savoured the sweet, fresh seafood and tender ,silky and exquisite sashimi : []
The italian cafe had a limited menu and the pizzas were terrible and only 2 pasta dishes which were microwaved : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Was sad to leave this place but had too : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They also have a tour desk there, if you wish to book tours with them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are a good size and the bed is very comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We will return to this hotel without hesitation : []
Had the great pleasure in staying in a palace club suite last year : [u'location', u'sea']
The pool area has been renovated in the last 3 years and the beach is clean and not a lot of hawkers ( expected in this part of the world though : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The beach was also clean and with plenty Bach chairs : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
This was our second stay and have had 3 other families stay here because of our recommendation : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They were all so helpful always, and would always acknowledge their guests all the time with a smile and a hello, throughout the resort : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Beautiful layout however I think there should be publicity given to daily highlights like Tennis Comp etc at breakfast even perhaps the day before there were a lot of events that went unnoticed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Palace Club in this hotel is absolutly FANTASTIC : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
However, if it is all refurbished, the room tariff would probably be at twice the prices you will find them for now : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Brilliant rooms, good location and very nice setting : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We booked a palace club room for ourselves and deluxe rooms for our sons : []
So I had to buy a $63 bottle of wine!! The food prices at the Hotel were Australian prices also but even so, we still ate there a lot as it was so enjoyable : []
Also the beds were not comfortable : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
The hotel it self was very nice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Or choices of activities from the sport club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The internet is horrifically bad and wireless is virtually non existent in any of the rooms : [u'amenities', u'internet']
My children loved the Gecko Kids club and sometimes wanted to stay longer when we went to collect them : []
We were a couple, but there were many families there as well : [u'overall', u'culture']
Resort amenities and ambience are both worth mentioning : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Pools good, beach breathtaking, but beware the hawkers! Had a personal guide who drove us around the islands best bits : [u'amenities', u'shopping']

The Beach is clean and really nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Normally when you visit a particular country, you want to indulge in the local cuisine : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just speak to the rep at the Customer Relations desk and be very firm if you require a change of room and they will come eventually come through : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The air went out on multiple nights during my seven night stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And this a resort-style hotel has a variety of restaurants inside : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bali collection is better than many people suggest in our opinion : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We loved the many nights sitting near the waves with our toes in the sand having meals with close freinds at Chess bristro : []
The arrangement and the diversity of the landscape make the hotel enjoyable for jogging : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The resort was amazing the lagoon pool was great huge with plenty of sun beds drinks and food a bit expensive considering Bali, but would definitely would stay again : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']

Brilliant beach, Ice Crams and drinks are served on the beach : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We liked the Rajas Balinese cuisine - the one with authentic Balinese food and the Chess restaurant - it's at the beach and you can have dinner and lunch under the beach umbrellas : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We have stayed at this hotel every year for the last 10x years and its absolutely excellent : []
We went for 4 days to Nusa Dua because we needed to work and relax a bit at the same time : []
23 years ago whilst travelling to New Zealand with my mother-in-law, we stopped at the Nusa Dua fBeach Hotel or an overnight break : []
The pools are nice, as expected the food was very expensive : [u'location', u'sea']
Other than that, it is just a typical resort, nothing special! : []
The Club Lounge also very nice, the staff is really friendly and helpful : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
Cannot say a bad word about Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Luxury escape was a great deal : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
My partner slipped on the tiles and cracked her head on the bathtub : [u'overall', u'culture']

although on the beach to the left of the hotel are a group of ladies that will offer massages on the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Let me tell you that its the best Balinese restaurant in Bali : []
There were breakfast items from almost every major Eastern and Western cuisine : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It had a very good kingsize bed and a nice balcony : []
Our room was a good size, really comfortable bed, super clean and a nice balcony with a peaceful view to the gardens : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Lovely atmosphere, warm staff, everybody so sweet and helpful : []
The weather was pretty wet in May but it did not spoil the holiday : []
Many thanks to the hotel management and everyone doing his or her best out of the hotel staff to welcome the visitors and make the stay and Nusa Dua Beach a fantastic experience! It is truly worth visiting and staying at if you are not way too picky : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room was neat and well equipped, we had complimentary champagne on our first night : []
The check-in was quick and easy, including changing the reservation name on one of the two rooms booked : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
The breakfast selection is vast with all nationalities, tastes and cultures catered for : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
Our room was close to the pool : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
This is a very nice Hotel, less busy than many in the Nusa Dua Resort Area and is very reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My late mother-in-law, who loved the world's grand hotels, would love this place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Thoroughly enjoyable 8 days with two small children : [u'overall', u'culture']
-Hotel provides a free shuttle bus to a nearby mall which sells foreign brands : [u'amenities', u'conference']
However when we asked if we could be together they were very helpful in changing the room to one next to ours the next day - which was great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
You felt like you were in Bali and not anywhere in the world which some of the other hotels seemed to appear as : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staffs are very friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The hotel was very traditional, well kept and the front entrance was stunning : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
do it : []
We were very tired from 2 flights so we had a quick swim, had dinner and went to bed : []
There's a pizzeria near the pool (very popular with the young ones) , bar and grill on the beach, Asian restaurant and Raja's Balinese restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
3) The breakfast buffet area needs to be manned by more attentive waiters : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Staff are all fantastic every one from concierge to cleaners are friendly, food is very good at the restaurants - I especially liked the italian - and breakfast buffet is extensive, hotel grounds and the beach are beautiful and pools are clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The breakfasts are great and the staff as I have said are very helpful and pleasant, I seem to spend some time grazing enjoying the view of the pond and gardens : []
especially we brought our six months baby : []
We requested an evening check out as we had a night flight, and, even after we specifically told reception in the morning, our key cards were blocked and we were locked out of our rooms on that afternoon : []
Sitting by the pool in a 5 star resort, I expect not to have to get up from the lounge chair, make my way to the bar to order food and drink : []
This is not the most expensive hotel in the area, nor the newest or most modern : [u'location', u'general']
The pools are great, sometimes a bit crowdy but Always found a seat next to pool : [u'room', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'banquet']
On arrival you will notice the beautiful landscaping and Balinese architecture, beyond the security checkpoints of Nusa Dua and the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Made us feel very special! Breakfast was wonderful : []
Prices of meals there were cheaper and there were also more varieties of food to choose from but we still preferred the quality of food at the hotel restaurants : []
I would recommend the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa in the future : []
The Massages were Amazing! Extremely professional : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The age of the Hotel seems to be an issue for people but I found that it gave the place more genuine character and authenticity than the more newly built resorts : []
only 3 choices rather than packets of the Kelloggs variety packs you normally get in good hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Everyone was so friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Nusa Dua beach hotel is the perfect get away in bali The hotel has all the facilities you need the hotel's design is beautiful the executive club was great with views on a garden with a lake a wide variety of restaurants best hotel i been to in Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
All of these issues did not spoil my holiday but would have improved it : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
each and every employee was very helpful and friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As it was my third 'stay'(unfortunately without my late husband this time) I found the management and staff as wonderful and accomodating as ever : []
This was our second visit to this hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My room is very comfortable, a bathtub will make it much better : []
The entire hotel staff deserve 100% credit : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We purposely booked our holiday nearly a week later than them, so that they had some time alone together and us too,for that matter!! She phoned me from the hotel and told me everything is beautiful and I wasn't disappointed when I got there : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Facilities are our prefered and very good for our Kids : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
When walking past the bed it caught the side of my calf twice, and I ended up with 2 good sized cuts : []
Overall, it was a nice resort with great service : []
The bedroom area had a massive bed (King size) and it was surrounded by a mosquito net (which you could put down in the evening and left up during the day) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool is lovely, I am not a great pool person anyway : []
The spa is also amazing! We spent time at the spa pool, then using the jacuzzi/steam room : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The breakfast buffet is excellent, with a large selection : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
This is the great ever hotel !!! Very reflexing,every morning, when i went out to the balcony, i will see some ducks catching around at small garden : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff at this hotel were wonderful and couldn't do enough to help : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
On checking out the male staff member who checked us out did comment that they have "much trouble" with the shower drains, but otherwise could'nt care less : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Not much interaction was observed : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I LOVED each one of them : []
Kind regards, Brenda Moore : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
However, the room we have is tiny and this is after we were told we had gotten an upgrade : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Luxurious rooms are exquisite with hand carved teak wood : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
There are a few restaurants and bars that we tried, but it should be improved compared with the price that they were charging : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Tips in hotel are not accepted, with very few exceptions : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Spa treatments are of course pricey, and you can go to other local spa centres (pickup and drop off incl), but then again you are staying 5x star, so you have to expect this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we ate at their restaurant on the 1st night and the food was so delicious and service attentive : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
I'm not one to complain : []
Very attentive friendly staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
& Spa and it won't be last : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
I could go on the free bike tour was great even when you had to pay it was only $15 for 2 : []
I loved the spa at the hotel so much that we visited every other day : []
Games room needs some attention : [u'location', u'sea']
The service and the hotel staff were fantastic and I really belive this has to be one of the best value for money resorts in Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Guest relations were particularly helpful and understanding when we were dealing with a sad problem at home : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub']
Nusa Dua itself is a bit far off from other areas such as Kuta or Seminyak, but the area is very well kept, secure, clean and very nice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We couldn't have imagined a more perfect setting for our honeymoon : []
We stayed here for one night only to finish up our Bali trip with a little bit of R&R : []
The manager just kept saying ' it is not free : []
We have been to Bali over 10 times and there are much better resorts in Nusa Dua or Kuta side : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Overall we loved our time at this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Also make sure you are not hiring any cab from Hotel as it is almost twice or thrice the cost available outside : []
There are also a few local shops around which are great for souvenirs such as wood carvings : [u'amenities', u'conference']
To be personally met at lobby in the morning by every staff member who arranged us a day tour to ensure a pick up in a quality vehicle with quality drivers was total profressionalism on a personal level : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
My wife and I stayed for eight days at this resort during April 2015 and couldn't be more happy : [u'overall', u'culture']
Bathrooms need renovating but no big issue : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Sleep Quality is for the thin walls, albeit if there were no noisy kids or connecting room the grade would be excellent : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
-Breakfast is crowded : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
great beach, excellent staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The air conditioning worked well and the bed was extremely comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
No need to beach them from the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It all depends on your own preferences : []
On check out we had our bags collected at 11pm : []
This is a richly constructed marvel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The other 2 theme nights were not so good : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Fourth - Another thank you to the General Manager for the beautiful get well card etc : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I will start with saying that it was a week in paradise! : []
This hotel is absolutely beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Beautifully maintained grounds and perfectly situated near the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We saw some of the previous reviews and by London prices, everything was terrific value : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also of how to use taxis and how much to pay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
But stay is nice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
GO and have a pleasant stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The accommodation blocks stretch back from the beach and rise to four floors which might be the legal limit : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We went to Sekar Jagat which is a 5 min drive - $60US for 3 hrs of pampering & return transfers to the hotel : [u'amenities', u'conference']
You will get the sellers on the beach but if you say no they don't hassle you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
the welcome drink served to u at the lobby bar is very interesting : []
this is one of the best hotels i have stayed in the world : []
Manager Dermot and Food and Drinks manager Sinead treated us especially well and I can't praise them highly enough : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
As members of the palace club, we were entitled to afternoon tea with lots of yummy cakes, and had free cocktails in the evening : []
Our room however was ok but maybe more of 4 star rating than 5 star : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We had one theme dinner , The Fire Dancers, were brilliant but not so the buffet meal : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
The staff are so friendly and so helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
On Monday the 7th Dec my parents, sister (18years) and I (21 years) arrived at the airport and was surprised to find that going through customs was quiet quick and easy considering we had to claim items of alcohol because it was more than 1 litre per person : []
I would recommend this hotel to anyone! : []
Wonderful staff! Everything at your fingertips with lots to keep you busy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pizza there is just as delicious and of course, their Balinese food is fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The roundabouts have huge sculptures and water features on them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
- We found a lizard in the room, for a troptical area is not strange but the good point is that they immediately changed our room for this reason as we requseted : []
The resort seemed to be about half full while we there, which meant that we did not have to contend with large crowds on the beach, at the pool, or in the restaurants : []
I enjoyed the sunrise viewing moment with my spouse during my stay, truly romantic : []
If you want a local experience, hire a car and go to Ubud - that is where I'll be staying next time : []
They have huge choice at the bufet breakfast, so many different kind of restaurants (bit expensive, but all right for a 5 star hotel), very kind hotel staff - they are always there if you need something, and from all of everything the spa was the best : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Our rooms were massive for a one bedroom and were marble from floor to ceiling : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The hotel is totally renovated and gives an impression of a luxurious and stylish resort with high standard in rooms, area and restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed in the three bed superior room : []
The beach close to most the water sports that we love such as jet ski, banana boat and flying fish : [u'location', u'mountains']
Will visit here again! Some of the employees even remember my name! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
com and there was a good deal : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Lovely terrace bar to sit in the evenings looking ov the ocean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We ate at most of the hotel restaurants which were much as you would expect at a resort hotel, a bit expensive and the food fairly bland : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One point of warning, the rooms in the hotel are quite dated and in need of renovation : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
One of the reasons I have'nt rated it 5 stars is due to the maintaince and that the rooms are not really a 5 star plush finish : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The hotel is right by the beach so if you don't feel like pool time, go straight ahead and fool around in the ocean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel has three pools, a lap pool located near the spa - has its own bar and is pretty quiet this pool stays open until 10:00pm : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Try to get a package that includes some of your food, and try to eat out at some of the restuarants just outside the Nusa Dua maingate as they give you much better value for money : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The only 2 things i didn't loko was that my room was close : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Great beach front in Nusa Dua but need to careful with the low tide and sea urchins : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I paid over $100 to just have a driver who dropped us off places, I'd see all the other tourists walking with their guide explaining things, but ours stayed in the car : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Italian dinner buffet looked fabulous, but the standard of the dishes presented were a let down : []
I would not hesitate to go here again - a fantastic hotel!!! : []
That was a big no no : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The best experiance we could have ever hoped for : []
The food, staff and facilities were excellent and we will certainly be returning to enjoy the peace and tranquility : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall, we cannot recommend this hotel highly enough : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
At the breakfasts only bacon and sausages : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Stayed for 5 days at this wonderful hotel during end of December : [u'location', u'sea']
We stayed 10 nights in September then headed to Jimbaran (Intercon : []
We did have a lovely holiday just a shame about the operational/f&b of the hotel : []
Kids enjoyed the occasional gecko club session : [u'overall', u'culture']
This is one of the best stays I had in a 5* hotel : []
After spending some time at Ubud, and then a few nights with friends at Sanur, we decided to spend our last 2 nights at Nusa Dua : []
If u want to be guaranteed a luxurious and comfortable stay - book this hotel : []
I scanned through a large number of hotel reviews in Nusa Dua Beach area before deciding on this property and had absolutely no regrets about my choice : []
Cons: only thing i have to flaw which isn't due to the hotel was the cocktails : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We stayed in a Deluxe room which was perfect : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Even the nearby golf course is now closed, with the nearest some 40 mins away : [u'location', u'general']
Fortunately there is an hourly free shuttle to Bali Collection for some shopping and more reasonable food options : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
This was a beautiful place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is wonderful, the pools equally, and the facilities many : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
In terms of location, there are many things/places you can access by taxi or the shuttle service but not much to do if you plan to walk around on foot : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The squirels were abundant but totally cute to watch : []
The bathrooms look like they might have had a refurb relatively recently but whoever designed them needs to go back to design school : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We were both checking in to the same class of room - the suites, so don't know why they couldn't finish our check in first?? : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Spas in Bali Collection had the right idea : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Cost back to hotel in a meter taxi was roughly $3 : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff is polite, not warm : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
which would have been nice as we bought a USB key along to watch some films : []
We just spent 11 days there with our family and we all had a lovely time : []
Wonderful location with loads of space, friendly staff, great food and very relaxing : [u'overall', u'spacious']
We have recommended many people to stay here and none have been disappointed : []
check-in was a breeze and room already made available : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
I have just returned from a 8 night stay, at this fabulous Nus Dua beach hotel : []
Would definately recommend this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We stayed here during May 25th - 2nd June with family and friends to celebrate a special birthday, weather fantastic not to hot but humid at times : [u'location', u'sea']
I would recommend this resort to all of my friends and family : []
We walked over to the Westin Resort and regretted not staying there instead as the lobby and pool area seemed much cleaner and more comfortable : [u'location', u'general']
The service was provided well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The gardens are outstanding : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Surfing, Volcano, Coffee Plantations, Bars, Temples get out there and take a look : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Picturesque location : [u'location', u'sea']
Excellent place for honeymooners, and families : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Definitely will be back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
food was freshly made and excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Surprisingly the hotel decorated our bed with 2 towel swans and roses, then served 2 glasses of wine and bunch of roses in the pot : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I would have liked a list of all activities that were going on every day including any sport that we could have partaked in : []
It had 2 bathrooms (1 with a bath) : []
All in all an awesome holiday : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The maid noticed, locked the room, and call the management : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
service is great & staff are very responsive to all our request ( requested to change room to a lower level & it was done instantly) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This Hotel is over 30 years old and it shows in the beautiful mature grounds and architecture : []
My wife and I purchased a Luxury Escapes deal and stayed for 8 nights in a Palace Club Suite : [u'overall', u'culture']
Overall we were extremely happy with the Palace Club facility, but the routine became a little boring : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
All up, a very peaceful and relaxing resort which ticked all the right boxes for us : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I loved Bali and loved staying in the Nusa Dua area - so peaceful!! : []
The surroundings, garden, pool area, beach area, lobby, entrance are really impressive and beautiful : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The guest relations couldn't do enough, i think her name was Yemi, she was exceptional with advice on things to do and did everything she could to make this a relaxing break for us : [u'overall', u'culture']
We chose it over some of the newer, more contemporary hotels as we wanted to stay somewhere traditionally Balinese in style, and whilst it has been going for over 30 years, it has been refurbished and is generally well maintained : []
I was extremely surprised by how fast and amazing the workers were : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Some sort of paging system might be of help here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Value for money was good when we went in low season : []
Nusa Dua area is perfect for that : [u'location', u'general']
But many restaurant has pick up service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Ok, so our airconditiong broke and it took a day for someone to come to look at it, we didn't sleep for a couple nights due to the heat : []
we had sooo much fun! There is a pizza restaurant by the pool, Sandro's Pizzeria, that is open during the day : []
It has an identify : []
The pools were fantastic, staff friendly, breakfast had a good selection and pool cafe served delicious food : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant']
They had a female pianist for a couple of evenings a week whose singing and playing was positively soporific : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Arrived on the 23rd December with family - 3 people : [u'overall', u'culture']
Will we return : []
better than expected : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
They have a nice fitness room, tennis and squash fields and beautiful and clean pool's : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Staff are very friendly and you will be able to go and visit Bali by taxi or tour : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed at the Royal Palace Suite and the room was absolutely perfect : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Our room was slightly on the small side and noisy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Would stay here again if we return to Valu : []
The theme dinners and dances were great also : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We had a wonderful time at Nusa Dua and it was due to the amazing effort this hotel made to ensure we had a great time : []
My husband demands to stay here every time we visit bali :) Love the staff who are friendly and go out of their way to help you : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Their staff were really polite and helpful, always smiling : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We will stay here again : []
Only negative thing I can say is hotel (& other 5 star hotels in the area) are in a secluded gated area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I hope that these minor issues would be fixed : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Let alone upgrade for loyal customer : [u'amenities', u'internet']
I stay there with my husband, my mother and 3 kids : []
I had a wonderful 17 days here and was very happy with everything : []
We enjoyed days of basking on quiet beaches and having longdrinks served poolside, but only experienced the real Bali by travelling away from this tourist-friendly area : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
I paid $35 for two people to go in a one hour glass bottom boat trip and we were the only ones on it : []
Shopping and lots of restaurants but do not stay there, waytoo busy : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We then take our time to pack up our things to get ready for checkout : []
We had good food at all the spots, though perhaps a bit pricey : []
Great for safety & security but you have to leave the resort by taxi to go anywhere including convenience store or any shops : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It's somewhat dated and you do notice immediately : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Someone said on their review that they saw a squirrel greeting them, and yes it's true! I saw them twice! : []
The kids club seemed great, however, there was hardly ever any kids in there which made our son a little apprehensive about going in there- so we never pushed it! : []
The resort caters for the sports lover as well : [u'amenities', u'pool']
My husband and I made our first trip to Bali for our 48th anniversary : [u'overall', u'culture']
It exceeded our expectations - the gardens were beautiful, the pools safe and clean and our room was clean with very comfortable pillows and king-size bed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The quality of the food all over the hotel was way below average for a leading hotel of the world status : [u'overall', u'safety']
I had a convention in Bali when I stayed in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and after my stay I found out that I made the right choice by staying in this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Would be nice touch to have fresh flowers after day 3 : []
Haven't stayed here since 2005 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
all this and fresh ice and water without asking : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Advice: book and stay in a Palace Club room for the ultimate experience : [u'overall', u'feel']
Will definitely recommend your resort to family and friends : [u'amenities', u'pool']
the prices were OK, the problem is the add taxes that brings the final price 40% more expensive of what is written : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In the time it's taken me to write this I've had 3 breakfast staff (palace club) come to attend to me! Now that's service! The resort is huge, with vast green areas : []
The hotel is 30 years old ,but still has Bali style ,Great gardens and pools, : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The breakfast buffet was spectacular : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Occasional palms : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pools and the beach were great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Love the first impression of the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The pools are nice, but the pools in neighbouring more upmarket hotels seemed more interesting : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We also enjoyed hand feeding the squirrels that came up to our balcony (they like raisn bran!) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There was a King bed in the main bedroom and twin beds in the 2nd bedroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
so go ahead and try it : []
The views each morning from the balcony of palm trees swaying in the breeze was paradise : [u'room-experience', u'view']
Some areas had a couldn't care less attitude - reception, information counter, tourist desk and some of the male service people who seemed to be the "controllers" but did a very ordinary job : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We stayed here on a 8 nights luxury escape package : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Only one downside: back then during my visit the internet connection was not exactly up to date : [u'location', u'sea']
Very very professionals : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Each room has daily toiletries, safe, water and a turn down service which was around 5 : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The double sliding doors which control the air conditioner look out over the beautifully maintained grounds and into a world of birds, butterflies, tropical plants, frogs, ducks and squirrels : [u'location', u'forest']
Housekeeping, though, was spotty : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The amenities were replaced everyday & housekeeping were most friendly : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Much commotion, many people involved, where's the check, what was the order?! I noticed many people walked off without fixing the check and the waiter asking me where they were : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Total value for money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
English skills are patchy so much gets lost in transit : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The rooms are spacious, clean and have all the amentities you could want : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
there although don't plan to shop - very overpriced : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a relaxing and self-indulgent holiday : []
Hope this helps for some : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Plus there was yoga classes on the beach and pool aerobic classes : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
This was disappointing and not acceptable for a hotel of 5 Star rating : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For a 4 1/2 **** it was okay : []
Or sit at a cafe and watch the wold go by : []
go again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We celebrated our daughters birthday there and the staff went out of their way to make it pleasant : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Service was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Heated and has sandy area so kids don't get sunburn staying in the beach too long : [u'overall', u'culture']
This was our first trip back to Bali in about 10 years and we are checking our diaries on how soon we can get back to the Nusa Dua Beach Resort & Spa : []
It is very extreme I was told because of the proximity to the equator : []
) are really pricey : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nothing too much trouble : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My only negative would be not getting liquid milk in our rooms with the service each day for our cuppa : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
But how could you not, with amazing buffet breakfasts, awesome food in every restaurant, relaxing pools with fabulous food & drink services, relaxing spa treatments and helpful staff everywhere : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Meals are expensive as are alcoholic drinks (typical of resorts) and our first night eating at the Balinese restaurant onsite was very disappointing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We wanted somewhere quiet, away from the hustle & bustle of the Kuta/Legian strip : []
The sea itself has quite a lot of seaweed growing on the bed so it's not a crystal clear blue lagoon but at high-tide you hardly notice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was arranged quickly and efficiently : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Ps, the pool was amazing : []
The hotel is in the older Balinese style, we found it to have a timeless charm with all the bells and whistles required : []
Excellent selection at breakfast! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The room was on the ground floor opening on to the garden looking over a small lake : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Nusa Dua is located about 15minutes drive from the main Kuta strip area where alot of the action tends to happen, but we were happy to be in a place where we could just hang around all day and be content : []
The mattress had a urine odor & stain : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
If you can tolerate the few negatives - it's a very reasonable price and you may like it more than we did : []
Which brings me to : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel has a homely feel and the biggest attraction is the private spa area away from families for some extra quiet and privacy : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This was very luxurious, you felt completely relaxed and pampered : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This resort is advertised as 5 star but we found it lacking : []
Nusa Dua as elsewhere has predominately been occupied by locals, and all the hotels employ local people and wherever you stay with their wonderful smile and great attitude they always make Bali so special : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
-wifi is free in community areas (pool, bar etc) but is $11AUD per DAY if you want it in your room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If and when we get to this part of the planet again will make an effort to come for a second stay : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They even have a basketball hoop set up in a little side pool so plenty of options : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The lay out of the rooms were lovely though, and gave you the Balinese feeling : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We arranged a later checkout and were locked out of our room but the room we had next door was left open with access to all our belongings : []
Got so close to me and snatched the cookie off my cappuccino around the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Pure bliss : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
An amazing resort with the most welcoming and helpful staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Room quite good but can be improve : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The rooms were large and comfortable, and the staff was very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Very good experience starting from check in until check out : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
The room was lovely with lots of Balinese furniture including a wonderful carved wooden door to the lovely bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The day spa was booked out most days and very expensive : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
If you want to relax by the pool all day then this is a great hotel to stay at : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach bar is a great place to hangout after a long day in the sun : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We had a spa treatment - the lap pool by the spa area is lovely and a nice place if you are looking for something quieter than the main pool area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We went to the playground at the resort every day : []
Plus there is a small department store - like a mini DJ's : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
000 for one) :-) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The cultural dinner and dance was a great night and a reasonable price for the quality of entertainment and food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
The ladies giving the massages were all very good and knew what they were doing : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Despite the initial damp problem I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the Nusa Dua area at a reasonably priced hotel - we had a fantastic holiday and will stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel again when we return next year : []
Good deals to be had at this hotel but the reason is the building going on next door goes on 24hrs a day and it is full on noisy and it is a distraction : []
During the day there is an assortment of little sandwiches and other snacks in the Club lounge and recommend the little strawberry and creme tarts! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We have had a great 2 weeks at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel in the Palace Club : []
traveled as a solo traveler : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
A nice range of shampoos, soaps, shower caps, tooth brushes etc certainly made staying here just that little bit easier : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just spent 9 days here and after scoping the local area we are very happy with our choice of resort : []
The beach is a few steps away from the pool,which makes access easy, the shallow waters are clear & calm : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We spent 9 days in Nusa Dua Beach and Spa hotel : []
Was there on our 12th Honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
Nusa Dua is a secure enclave of luxury hotels well away from the real Bali, but the hotel facilities and service are of a very high standard : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Bali is the best place I've visited since a long time : []
That was until we went to Kuta beach : []
The hotel also invites local traders to set up stalls in the hotel grounds in the evening which gives a market feel : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The staff are very attentive and accommodating, nothing is too much trouble and we always feel very welcome : []
The hotel was right on the beach, where there were plenty of chairs and towels : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Thank you to the Palace Lounge staff for a memorable stay at the Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
It was really expensive and possibly the worst massage I've ever had : []
Pros: beautiful grounds, beach location, staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The sports facilities are good, but we thought ridiculous the fact that we had to pay for everything! It is ok to pay a fee to rent a squash or tennis material, but paying for classes such as aerobics, yoga?! That should be complementary to the hotel guests! : []
The pool bar was also great, and the bartender very friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are 2 types of rooms there : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
After a couple of days we thought we should get out and about and see more of Bali, so we had car with driver who took us to places we requested to see which was great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The service was excellent, very helpful and friendly : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We saved a lot of money by not paying tourist rates : []
In particular the coffee was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'meal', u'drinks']
But this place is SO out of date, rooms are old and in disrepair, had to room change 3 times until I got a room w/AC and where the room was functional : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
This hotel was great for our family but it was disappointing that out of all the restaurants at the hotel we were only offered a kids menu at one, and room service had a kids menu : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The rooms were pretty big, and the lobby/entrance is absolutely breathtaking at night : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The breakfast is vast, ranging from a complete warm Japanese meal and European cheese, to beef sausages, for the Islamic guests : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
They drove us there ( soooo quick with the new toll bridge ) and just waited till we wanted to go somewhere else or go back to the hotel : []
which made sleeping very unpleasant : [u'amenities', u'conference']
You can rent a bike to add adventure to your vacation! The best place to rent a bike is Kutta beach area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
56 people who attended the wedding mostly stayed here, and everyone was amazed at the level of service provided : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Our room was one of the Palace Club Suites on the fourth floor overlooking magnificent gardens : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The hotel facilities were quite comprehensive as a 5 stars hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
But The rooms are average : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Stayed in a palace club room of this beautiful hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
First of all, nusa dua is at least 40 minutes from anywhere that is worth going to : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are perhaps a little dated but charming : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Our room was lovely and we were given a complimentary upgrade which was a nice touch : [u'amenities', u'conference']

Although this was our 3rd and 4th trips to Bali, this was our first to Nusa Dua and with the wheelchair : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The architecture is very balinese unlike the other hotels and you can see bali temple like structures at lots of places in the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is a great spa : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Pools as always were clean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Having said that workers in these resorts earn between US$100 and US$200 per month so a few extra bucks means more to them than it does to you; : []
We were made to feel especially welcome, as I'm sure everyone is made to feel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Transfer to hotel was smooth as it is around 20 mts drive : []
-Westin is next door for other lunch/food/price options : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The breakfast buffet provided for a large array of good quality food : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
It really does feel like seeing old friends !! : []
The rooms were the only air conditioned areas we noticed, but that was fine as we became accustomed to the heat : []
Not everything can be left out to this excuse : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We are going back next year : []
The rooms are good, spacious and clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I had my hair done at the hair salon and this was way overpriced : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort sits right on a clean and perfectly usable beach : [u'amenities', u'pool']

Buffet breakfast - to die for!! : []
The Spa facility was second to none, with lap pool lounge chairs to relax in peace and quite : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We visited Kuta to shop and Seminyak for a couple of beautiful dinners, but felt very satisfied lazing around the hotel for a very relaxing and peaceful break : []
Staff (in some instances) seem confused about some of the vouchers on offer : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Not enough local dishes, overall have no enough choice! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Staff were amazing, would do anything to help : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Stayed at this hotel, in Palace Club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']

Amazing place, staff were great friendly and helpful, food excellent, great place to relax and regenerate : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Good for those stormy nights in : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
In general the hotel and the its grounds looked out of this world : [u'overall', u'safety']
Hotel facilities are great, as is the buffet breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel and grounds are impeccable : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The ladies were amazing and so nice! The beach was beautiful and the Nusa Dua complex was also beautifully maintained : [u'overall', u'culture']
I went for several early morning (sunrise) walks in both directions along the beach and the views were just breathtaking : [u'room-experience', u'view']
The only (minor) negative is 3pm check-in : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel is located within a 5-10 minute walk to the Nusa Dua markets and Bali Collection Shopping Centre if you want to stretch your legs and do some shopping / eating, etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was ok, accordind to the 5* classification : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Expect similar standard but at half the price : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
You can get a taxi to take you around the whole place for the day and it is so cheap to do just that : []
2) Add more vegetarian stuff in your menu : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Had the pleasure of staying at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel twice this month, having stayed several times before : [u'location', u'sea']
They love children and make you very welcome : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One thing I finally figured out,if they do not understand english,they will just say yes,half the staff does not speak english : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Kids had a good time at the pool : [u'overall', u'culture']
So were were able to get eggs Benedict amongst other choices for breakfast and were made fresh and not on a buffet : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
When we first enter the room we realized that there were insects everywhere, the sheets and the curtain had dirty spots and overall it wasn't a nice room either : []
Hotel staff were sooo helpful and friendly and great with the kids : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Amazing highlight : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Was always excellent and 5star plus : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

There are a few great bars and restaurants where you can have cocktails, bar snacks or fine dining : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
say hi to Anum, a friendly waiter at the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
They charge for wifi and after a few days, the food options can seem limited : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Paid for a deal here for 8 days with the palace club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Buffet breakfast each morning was a wonderful start to the day and the variety of dishes amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I had researched it closely here on TA and was delighted with the choice : []
we spent our honeymoon at this lovely hotel : []
These hotels need to provide drawers in the bathrooms & a 2400v hairdryer would be a nice touch : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Instead we are currently three resorts down the beach at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, which got much better reviews following a makeover : [u'amenities', u'conference']
While this is a very nice hotel, with a large pool and decent-sized rooms, I would not class it as one of the Leading Hotels of the World : []
we will come to this place everytime we plan for bali, : []
Look up Made Artaean for a great tour guide MadeArtawan on Facebook beach was warm : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The amenities are excellent and the towels thick and absorbent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Of course staying in Nusa Dua means the traffic to and from other destinations can be a pain, but that relates to the location, not this hotel specifically : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Very child friendly and maybe not perfect for a single couple in the high season if you want to have a quiet holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are not dark if trying to sleep before nightfall, they do not have block out curtains, but sheer curtains and shutters, the shutters let in the light of day and management keep the lights on on the balconies until midnight : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
But after few day I just find back yard area, it was beautiful quit & more luxury : []
The hotel was stunning, really beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Service really is one of the main ingredients of this successful hotel and is genuinely displayed by all staff throughout the resort : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Kids club was loved by my 6 and 7 year old : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The staff are so friendly & helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It was so divine that I am still dreaming of it : []
It is a very open and quite luxurious hotel, with a grand lobby, recently renovated deluxe rooms, fantastic sports centre and lovely pools : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
It has great landscaping with multiple restaurants, bars, pools, etc : []
This was unacceptable as we were already sweating from the walk to the limousine and although the waiting area overlooked a very beautiful garden it was still three hours in heat and humidity not accustomed to and although the tea was very nice we just wanted a shower and to freshen up : []
Definitely 5 star plus service in the Nusa Dua Hotel from all levels of staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
All in all a very nice to place to stay and very good value for the money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My Fiance and I ate at two of the restaurants at the resort, the Chess Restaurant and the Sandros restaurant, both of which were really nice and really friendly, both again compared to the rest of Bali quite pricey however when you stay in Nusa Dua you expect prices at resorts to be quite a lot higher than the general average, we were paying around 400,000 a meal with the main and drinks : []
Beautiful hotel / surrounding and great spa facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For a hotel that was the first of its kind in Nusa Dua it is a beautiful resort with wonderful staff & attention to detail : []

Friendly staff, great location and very relaxed : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Thank you for the hospitality of your stafs : []
Good rates at the exchange next to the mini mart just over the lights : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
It was a wonderful experience in every aspect be it the location, the aesthetics, the ever smiling courteous staff, the small thoughtful touches like personalised photograph, live music, tour services, spa services : []
than that we had a wonderful stay : []
The balinese architectural of hotel was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Over all, I will come back this hotel, but I would like to try others else : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The luxury escape menu is a bit limited but there are 3 restaurants to choose from so it is still pretty good : []
Dusty under furniture : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'conference']
Out the hotel there are local restaurants which are well worth a visit and easier on the pocket, by far : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Rooms of good quality and servicing spot on : [u'overall', u'safety']
Would rather be closer to the main pool which is nearer to the beach also : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They would come and clean the room each morning and come again in the afternoon to prepare our beds, clean again and change our towels : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The pools were clean ( we usually opted for the more private lap pool near the spa area : [u'location', u'general']
If you are looking for food only, then by all means dine outside, but if you appreciate quality of food and service, then what the hotel is offering is extremely good value for money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I did feel like the hotel was trying to rip us off, generally things in hotels are a lot more expensive which I understand but this was excessive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Enjoyed the beach which was kept immaculately clean and the pools which are no more than 10 metres from each other : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I asked at the front desk if it was possible to somehow block out the sunlight and within hours, room service staff had stapled black material to the wooden doors, and covered the glass panels : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We stayed here as part of our honeymoon for 10 nights : []
Everything about the Premier room was above my expectation, from the bed to the shower facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There aren't too many money exchangers other than the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa 16 to 23rd October 2014 : []
If you want to take the taxi from the hotel it costs you over 300% so ask the taxi control to call a taxi for you from outside : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Even a better alternative to this is to take a free shuttle, leaving the resort every hour, to "Bali Collections" : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We took a Deal (from Deals : []
The beach is lovely as the trees are growing in the sand and beautiful to sit under : [u'amenities', u'garden']
go to the shops) : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The fish pond on the breakfast area was quite entertaining and I saw some kids and the staffs fed the fishes with leftover breads : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The downside from the hotel - Breakfast is defiantly less than average : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We were treated to the Palace room package which included spa packages, afternoon cocktails and dinner vouchers : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I found the Spa facilities lovely, there is a spa pool located near the front end of the hotel, near the gym : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
In this day and age it is time that it is just rolled into the room price : []
(Neither of these companies are associated with Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, I should point out) : []
Probably the best holiday ever had : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The morning breakfast buffet was fantastic and had the biggest selection of fresh fruit and foods daily with these changing daily : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Go for it : []
Wifi is free in the lobby area but charged in the rooms (I just don't get this) and the bar next to the lobby has a great afternoon tea and happy hour, it is very chic and modern : []
the pool area is fantastic and yes there can some geman-itus in respect to the towels but its a holiday worst things happen in the world : [u'location', u'general']
I love the food, gardens and bar in pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
On the whole that expereince at the hotel was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It's not terribly expensive : []
These are things to consider in the heat and humidity that comes with a Balinese holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel is the oldest in Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I will likely to stay this resort again if I ever visit Nusa Dua, for point #2 & 3 it's easy to solve : []
Would reccommend this hotel for peace and quiet away from the fast past Kuta : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We came here on a Luxury Escape package with 10 nights inclusive of all food plus an additional charge for children which I would not recommend : [u'amenities', u'conference']
it was great location : []
Pleasant and easy check-in, our time spent at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was very enjoyable : [u'location', u'sea']
there were plenty of pools to chill by : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Overwall a decent hotel, but for the price I think I would've liked a bit more perks, like a better beach or free Internet, which I'm sure other hotels could provide : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The package had loads of inclusions starting with the fast track at the airport, return airport transfers (the resort actually allowed us to use the return part of the transfer to be driven to our second hotel in Sanur as we were not leaving Bali), daily buffet breakfast which was fantastic (amazing fruits, vegetables, freshly baked breads and pastries, Indonesian breakfast foods, eggs, bacon, etc), 3 themed dinners (we missed the first one and the resort gave us a 3 course dinner voucher to use in our choice of on-site restaurant), welcome cocktail, one off unlimited laundry, USD45 room service voucher, 6 x 1 hour long spa treatments etc : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This is truly a world class hotel with amazing service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The grounds were beautiful, the public areas were well laid out and stylish, the pools and beach were stunning : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We stayed in the palace club rooms, the staff in the palace club could not be faulted : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
My only negative was that pool beds were taken very early in the morning by people "reserving" them well before breakfast : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
our rate included breakfast whcih was very good and there was a big selection : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
Very good hotel, staff was very professional and helpful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
My wife also tried the hotel's spa for which she has a polish massage : [u'overall', u'culture']
Thanks to SIOBHAN who helped with my partner and made the night enjoyable for me : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I was at this resort last year, People are very friendly,We stay together with our families they come from Sydney and Perth : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Love to be back here again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
this property won my heart for its amazing natural beauty and very polite staff : [u'room', u'furniture']
Jackfruit is my new found favourite fruit, but also the guava, mango and sourstrop are a delight to the tastebuds : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Another small point is the annoying music being played by the guys at breakfast on the Metallophone (traditional Indonesian Instrument) I appreciate its traditional and I'm sure the the guys are very talented but do we need to listen to this at breakfast? : []
The location was convenient, very easy to get around : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We plan to return again very soon : []
There were plenty of bars and restaurants and we ate and drank at the lobby restaurant and at the beachside restaurant with nice views of the sea : []
The bath robs once used were not replaced : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
if you want to explore the area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed on a luxury escape package and it was excellent : []
Wireless Internet access in the room was terrible, probably because of the sprawling nature of the complex, but still strange this hasn't been addressed given the hotels proximity to the conference centre and volume of business travelers and conference attendees : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only moan is regarding taxi service booked through the hotel, which seems a bit steep and fares open to negotiation! Otherwise, all great and comes highly recommended : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It's hard to be cranky : []
Nice estate and gardens, on the beach, great facilities and good food at different restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
were obliged to quit the table because of another booking made by another couple earlier on), apparently not enough tables for all guests for breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I booked online on hotel website as there were some specials running incl free airport transfer : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast was touch and go with regards the service : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Before I booked I really spent long time to choose this hotel : []
I ordered a beer which was not included and for some reason this posed a problem even though I knew this was extra and was happy to pay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed there for 4nights,the location is perfect for retreat and relaxing,we didn't have to leave the hotel,great variety breakfast buffet plus 4restaurants : []

My 2 week stay was like living in paradise : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The facilities, kids club, and everything was just picture perfect : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
You pay a little more but it is so worth it , and to have 150m of private beach front in your hotel where you can relax and get served a drink on the sand without getting hassled is just one of the many things that makes this hotel a truly great experience , even if the hotel is full it still doesn't feel over crowded : []
Bali Collections is definately the place to eat out in as the restaurants are quite expensive within the resort, there is a shuttle bus each hour to take you there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall, we were after an easy resort experience, and this place satisfied expectations : []
So much food to choose from : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Went to Bali Collection which is about a ten minute walk south : [u'amenities', u'conference']

A special stand out staff member Anita we thank you : []
We have suggested to the Hotel that they look at ways of catering to slightly older children as well : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Don't be afraid on your first day to acquaint yourself with the people up there as prices are not as high as you would expect in Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Well this is not going to happen n Nusa Dua Beach Hotel! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
basically inedible : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

I don't think there is anywhere in the world more peaceful, yet energizing that having a cup of Bali coffee in the outdoor breakfast lounge : []
Also ty for our anniversary and birthday gifts : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Watch out for the porters at the airport : [u'location', u'airport']

The breakfast buffet is super complete & delicious, I love their pastry & ommelette : []
- wireless WiFi should've been included on a high class hotel : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The only thing that put me off was that the balcony was a bit dirty so we did not feel like utilizing it : []
Fabulous attention to detail in the public areas : [u'location', u'general']
Hands down, this is one of the best hotels we've stayed in : []
We were shocked by the beautiful lobby and even the smell was gripping : []
so much time was wasted which caused us to miss the sunset at uluwatu : [u'amenities', u'conference']
And have to pay for WiFi : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We paid a driver 400,000 rupiah ($40AU) for 8 hours to visit tennah lot & ulawatu, he waited for us & helped us navigate the culture (the cheeky monkeys) & our surroundings : []
Step in the legendary hotel of Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa Bali early of May 2013 and i found this hotel are still doing great, clean and refurbished room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

We just wished we were able to bring the family, children and grandchildren : []
My first massage felt like someone rubbing oil all over me and was very unsatisfying, however my second one was fabulous : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
After just a few hours the staff - I hate that word - all know your name, how you take your coffee and your preferred sunset tipple : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We found that they used different kinds of spirits to make the cocktails, they were different brands to what we have in Australia and the quantity of spirti was different : [u'overall', u'safety']
He had his own toilet : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
There was a wide assortment of food and it was delicious : []
Transportation was fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The voucher passport is a hit with everyone and the ambience of the Palace area made for a really restful and relaxing holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The gardens and Balinese settings for this hotel are stunning but tranquil : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Overall Nusa Dua Hotel is an excellent hotel, great & friendly service, calm area to stay, safe & relaxing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel is very clean and well appointed hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The resort is over 20 years old & has not been renovated in that time and it shows : []
I'm sure we will be using the hotel again next time we come to Bali : []
We cannot praise the management and staff of this hotel enough, from the minute we booked in with ageing parents one in a wheelchair we found the staff and the hotel absolutely wonderful : []
If they are then they shouldn't be holding buffets : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There is a walk along the beach front past all the large hotels and if you follow this a little further there is a small shopping / restaurant area (Bali Collection), where you can buy the usual tourist souvenirs as well as a couple of supermarkets for snack etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is a wonderful taste of paradise : []
Spent one evening at the hotel and booked the palace club room : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
Overall just a great place to stay! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

I have to pat myself on the back for choosing well : []
Upon checking in we were relegared to Rm 3209, which overlooks the driveway amd is a bus trip from the pools and beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We have just got back from Bali and had our final days in Novotel hotel : []
Which is a real bore for us as we are going to make babies : []
Loved the architecture of the hotel : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
) I highly recommend staying here, and yes the food may bit a bit $$$ than being in Kuta, but that;s the choice you make either stay in a 5 star hotel and don't whinge or go : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They were looking for $90 for the day : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Only shortage is kids meals choices very limited especially we stay for 9 days there, and kids everyday have the same menu : [u'overall', u'culture']
Bottom line, we'll return to this hotel soon : []
There was hardly any Singapore tourists in sight : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The pool is gorgeous with lotsa of deck chairs and shade : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Nusa Dua beach Hotel provided all and more : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
And I lost my opportunity to enjoy the Spa facility due to hectic conference time, as the Space close at 10pm and can not enjoy it during day because of the conference : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel has a couple of great pools to swim in and several restaurants catering for different tastes : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The drinks and food is a little pricey here, but if you have the money to stay there it shouldn't be an issue : []
The main pool with the swim up bar is really nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
I have always stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Resort ever since I was young and it was always our number one choice for some where to relax : []
Evening walks along the sea front are lovely with a stop at the many bars and restaurants even before you arrive are Bali Collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We dined in at one the restaurants and it was great (I think it was the Balinese restaurant, couldn't remember the exact name as i was there in November) : []
Staff were invariably friendly, especially to the children (perhaps it helps by being friendly to them!) - in fact the only rude people there were some of the eastern European guests! : []
The grounds are full of superbly manicured detail whether it is foliage or terraces between floors and the whole place is truly spotless : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However, now that the hotel has come under the ownership of the Sultan of Brunei, it is being renovated to bring it up-to-date without sacrificing its Balinese style : []
The pools are clean & huge, the waters are warm & delightful : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

The resort just had to cut/remove their commission : [u'amenities', u'pool']
nice spa as well : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Is the service good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It was an ok hotel in comparison with other beautiful five star hotels in Nusa Dua area : []
I could not believe that this hotel has been around since 1983 : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I have no idea why but a taxi costs about $10 and the transfer $50 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Altogether a very relaxing holiday, excellent accommodation, good food and superb service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Spa (very expensive) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We actually had some really nice cheap Balinese food there too : []
We stayed here for 13 days : []
Everywhere we went, we were bothered with loud noise of grinding stone from construction, they were by the pool as well as the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Clean, well maintance beach : []
About our suite: : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Hotel design very near to real BALi - different to all Nusa Dua Hotels - highly to recommend there ! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
the warmth and receptivity of the staff started with the booking process and was really happy to get the rooms we wanted : []

Food great, the staff are the best : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
All the staff were very friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
the buffet breakfast selection and setting next to the ponds was incredible : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
So sorry guys, great location, some lovely people and everything for it : []
Staff as always were incredible, welcoming us "home" the minute we arrived : []
I've travelled to Vanuatu a few times and at the resorts they have live bands and traditional dancing which was all free and would be a great addition to anyones stay at the resort : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The room itself is dated with electrical problems ( lights turning themselves on & off at will ) dirty showers ( probably due to the age rather than cleaning staff ) mouldy couch & complimentary bed bugs : []
The breakfast restaurant was in a very beautiful setting : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The rooms are excellent, the a/c works a treat and the bathrooms are great : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
over $250 US per day just for the room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
we're walking for 20 min in this hot weather to the other hotels' beaches : []
The breakfast was superb with lots and lots to choose from, and if it is not there you only have to ask and they try to please you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Try it, you will like it!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It wasn't cheap and there were definitely be much cheaper options for a stay in Bali but it was safe and friendly : []
So much to do in the hotel alone, location was perfect : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Once they found out we were on our honeymoon they gave us some complimentary drinks in our room : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
So it's expensive, but that's high season : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we should have complained but we just sprayed it with perfume : []
This resort lived up to my expectations : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Would recommend for families, couples and those wanting to stay within the hotel for relaxation : [u'overall', u'culture']
We walked to Benoa for supplies one morning which is about 20-30 minutes along the beachfront : [u'amenities', u'conference']
however,it could have a better dining at the beach front if the squirrels are off limit to the place : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Sure, we'll return one day and wished we had booked for a few nights more : []
My advise would be to talk 200 metres to the end of the road and use of taxis waiting there : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We have never been to a better appointed hotel : []
Stayed here for 6 nights in September : [u'location', u'sea']
Surely, a 5 star hotel would have been more prepared to handle such thunderstorms, which is not even close to a tsunami! : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Nice view of the rear gardens : [u'amenities', u'garden']
We had a refreshing shower with fresh towels and all amenities we needed, then relaxed in comfort on sofas in the air-conditioned large room watching tv and had a coffee before returning to reception to order our taxi for the airport : []
$200 a round and $50 in club hire : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It rained whilst we were there and we could not walk to any of the restaurants so room service had to do,but instead of opening the coffee shop and encouraging the hotel guests to go there they hotel was happy to see people clambering for a seat on the shuttle to the galleria : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights upon arrival in Bali, It is very beautiful, the gardens are amazing and well maintained, and it has a lovely Balinese feel to it but with all the modern conveniences : []
Breakfast has everything you could think of and more and unlike some hotels, doesn't finish ridiculously early! All the staff we dealt with were so friendly and genuinely helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The cost of meals, drinks etc was very high : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Staff were friendly enough but very rigid in what they understood the rules to be : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Not a pleasant experience I'm afraid and certainly not one to be repeated : []
Heaps of options and you can be quick, which is what is needed for a young family : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast was good, and we found the upscale Balinese restaurant on sight quite scrumptious : []
Just awesome! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We spent 10 nights at this hotel to celebrate our Silver Wedding : []
We stocked up on local beers and water at a nearby market as I dislike paying through the nose for simple things at resorts : []
A big luxurious resort complex which offers everything that you expect from a 5 star establishment - no complaint at all! The Deluxe rooms were a bit small and worn-out, although the website claims that they were recently refurbished (a bit hard to believe, if you ask me) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were traveling with kids and chose a Family room which comprises of a bedroom and a separate living area : [u'amenities', u'conference']
If someone out there can inform me one of the areas where they have to improve : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The service at the spa was not better : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Stayed at Nusa Dua in the Palace Suite : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Plus, you'd have a beautiful stretch of beach at your doorstep : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
(Staff had taken my dress to the laundry so that it was crease free - it looked perfect) : []
The services is without compare : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It was the low season so the hotel wasn't at capacity which I am sure contributed to my good experience : []
The beds can be separated : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Having never stayed in Nusa Dua before we used trip advisor to make our selection; and were speechless (in a good way!) when we arrived : []
the check in to give a deposit of 2,000,000 IDR is still iur question, not in Luxemburg or Boaton you pay that! and we were asked from a 3 rd world country that amount! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is a good size balcony, with comfortable chairs, we face a lovely Balinese garden complete with ducks, unfortunately a old cigarette butt had been left uncleared on the balcony which was not good : [u'amenities', u'conference']
If you like to experience, traditional Balinese Dances, they have 3 great theme nights a week, serving the most sumptuous buffet dinners : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The breakfast was excellent available from 06 : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Our first visit to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was in late 1980 when there were only 3 hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The staff however are world class and are so welcoming and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The hotel is in an enclosed and guarded enclave of hotels and shares the long beach with the Westin the Laguna and others : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Although this room was not musty, there were a lot of little things that needed fixing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I hope the hotel will improve these : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The gate to the Nusa Dua area is only a ten minute walk away : [u'location', u'general']
It is the best buffet I have ever seen (I have seen many being a flight attendant) : []
We will come back! : []
-Hotel restaurant food was pretty bad, but so is every restaurant in Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We will definitely be going back : []
Thank you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for keeping the great lunch and services : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A word on the cabs - the hotel will be eager to get you to use their transport : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Beautiful beach with very minimal rubbish ( unlike legian)so you can swim in the clear water! And walk the beach! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is clean (for Bali) but the water is still pretty polluted (the beach is clean because the rubbish is cleaned by hotel staff throughout the day but check out all of the debris on the rocks when the tide goes out for a true picture of how clean the water is) : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Minibar way overpriced : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is such a great location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Kuta is 15 minutes away if you want that : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My new husband and I stayed here for 8 days as part of our honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
My self & colleagues need to unnecessary wait for something that shall be done easily related with transportation to our golf event : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The grounds and facilities at the resort are wonderful, had everything we all needed to relax, and feel pampered : []
We requested a room change : []
no welcome drinks/ fruit : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I come and stay in this hotel for many times before and they don't have my record in the computer : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There's lots of shade, and the beach is a lagoon style and tidal, and is also very clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We wish we could have extended it : []
No freeWifi in rooms just mainly in lobby which is annoying : [u'amenities', u'conference']
i went to Bali not knowing about the enormity of it's spa industry : []
from open fish aquarium till open beaches evrything was great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
It is a civilized world,a little bit in a snobish way : []
In Nusa Dua, all the resorts are next to each other, so you can do a hotel/pool-crawl which we did one day :) Besides that, the Nusa Dua area is good because it's separated from the rest of Bali, but also bad because it's further to get to Seminyak/Kuta area (traffic was really congested when we were there, especially due to the tunnel works? near Kuta) : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Great place to visit if you need some R&R - all services and facilities were more than satisafactory : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They have different dance/dinners on a weekly schedule and we went to the Keckak dance and very much enjoyed watching the lovely dance while eating a huge meal (24 AUD pp) The beach was nice and we enjoyed getting drinks and food while relaxing on the deck chairs : []
Some (small) negatives: towels weren't always available in women's change rooms (near spa); vegetarian food wasn't clearly labelled & the egg cooking station needs a vegetarian only frypan & utensils; suites were overly chilled (great for males!); desserts need working on : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The room and hotel was quite serviceable to our needs - the A/C was exceptional after coming inside from other places in hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel looks beautiful, great lobby and snacks pool ok walk out to the beach is beautiful : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
On arrival at the resort, you would be greeted by the magnificent Bali architecture at the entrance and through out the hotel premise : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For massage, you can get a cab to Spa Coconut which is near Conrad Hotel, check out http://spa : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Excellent location for a weeks getaway with the wife and friends : [u'overall', u'culture']
I shopped at CoCo's which is a supermarket/variety store with very good pricese : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We would definantly choose this hotel again : []
I took a chance and booked my reservation, I ordered an airport pickup, the driver was waiting for me right outside international arrivals and whisked me off to the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
they even have beach cleaners : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Everything about the hotel met my expectations : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
people are very cordial and helpful : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This hotel has a few hundred rooms so it's a mega resort that attracts crowds and serves mediocre food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The entertainment we would rate number one in the Nusa Dua Resorts : []
(We'd had an upgrade to a deluxe room the first time : []
The pools are extremely clean and so is the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The hotel is well maintained and the pool and beach are amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']

The entry fee is the same as western prices, but it is a lot of fun : []
We were offered some refreshments and were able to see a few rooms before we choosed one : []
Nice hotel and great location in Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
They provide abundant food on breakfast time, i like it! We can have breakfast with nice Balinese garden view : []
We are already looking forward to returning next year & hopefully for many years to come : []
The spa here is exactly as the brochure describes, now we all know that never happens, you walk or should I say float back to your room : []
Bacon is awful, sausages worse : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
but most of all, the staff : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The food in all restaurants excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
What truly makes it is the staff : []
Without exception the staff were charming, friendly, : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The security is five star, lovely to walk to the village or the Bali Colletion (shopping center) during the day or the night : [u'overall', u'safety']
No shops just outside the Resort as there are at other locations on the Island : [u'location', u'sea']
I did however end up finding & I still had 5 lunches & 3 dinners left : [u'location', u'sea']
Or get a taxi elsewhere it will be cheaper : []
We al had an amazing time and was very impressed by the resort and staff : []
We stayed at the resort in July 2013 : []
The hotel amenities itself (pool, garden, spa) is also great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
This was our second trip to this hotel and the main attraction was the staff who are helpful, hospitable and have a high regard for customer service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We went twice in 3 days : []
The quality of the food was also really high : [u'overall', u'safety']
Thank you so much for making our holiday so special and relaxing : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Hotel room is clean, balcony is a bit small and dirty : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
My girls enjoyed Friday nights' theme (Fire dance) as they got to have an impromptu sing with the band afterwards : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
On our last night at this resort we had to listen to thumping music until 11 pm : []
Other than that we chose to celebrate my birthday and my husbands retirement right at the hotel and spa : []
The gardens are manicured to an inch and the trees and plantings are all mature giving the place an nice shady feel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you plan on exploring outside Nusa Dua don't use the hotel transport its expensive : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
First impressions count, and from the spectacular lobby on arrival and the fantastic service we received from the check in staff who didn't bat an eyelid about us being a couple of hours early and checked us in immediately, everything went smoothly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel catered well for children but this didnt bother us who were there to relax : [u'amenities', u'patio']
As a professional singer, the harmonies these three fellas are singing at The Chess Bar are just magic! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The bedroom had parquet flooring and the bathroom had both a bath and a large shower : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
We would never normally partake of hotel restaurant food but here it is different , the Chess Bar and brasserie serves a good choice of excellent quality food, the steaks are especially good as is the range of meats per se : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Just a small example of the attention to detail this hotel provides : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The little squirrels are also pretty cute : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Everything with the arrival and check in was smooth and fast : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

30 pm, the time when most beachfront restaurants of Nusa Dua hotels /resorts closed yet : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
I travel the world for business and usually stay in five star properties : []
And they reached it : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Overall, the resort grows on us more and more every day, and we now look forward to returning here : []
The private beach is very quiet, you can do sunbathing or swim at the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The staff there are also very friendly and will be happy to be at your service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

Possibly the only real negative is the quite high prices of the drinks and meals with no real options for a small cheap meal : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']

Love the hotel, beach is clean and peaceful, staff are friendly, room service is good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

try the Korean BBQ : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

The spa is exceptional, offers multiple treatments and honestly could not be faulted : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Food wasn't as fresh, ingredients used for omelettes and the like appeared processed, not great quality and the poolside food etc was pretty ordinary tasting yet pricey for what you got : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The service was quite reasonable and the room was fine : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The room was equipped with a fridge that was of a small but decent size and doubled as the minibar (which was expensive) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
A 5 minutes walk to the convention centre, especially good for work related stay : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']

The rooms really are kept in immaculate condition : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Everyone warns about changing money in Bali, and I was a little disappointed that the bank within the resort did try to short change me! So be mindful of this!! Also the taxi service is a lot more expensive from the resort, just pop outside the gates and grab yourself a bluebird cab! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The service offered at the Palace Club is really amazing and it is a joy to return every year to a place where everyone remembers you, welcomes you as one of the family : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I think that our problems mentioned above would have been solved much more smoothly if the staff could or would just tell us what was happening : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Definitely will recommend the hotel, but hope that they pay more attention to the first impression given to guest from arrival to check in : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Then we would walk on the walkway which extends along the beach : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This was the only down side though : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One other point of interest (which I also didn't get to fully enjoy) : []

Totally loved the place!! Amazing location : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The rooms are comfortable, but a little more care with the cleaning is really required and the furnishings are looking tired and cushions grubby : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
Beautiful place, service for our rooms was great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I wont give 5 stars as i did feel at one point a little discriminated against because I had tan skin (filipino/mexican) and i think they thought i was a local instead of a tourist (i came from california!) and did not give me service at the beach like they gave all the other "light skin" guests : []
There is a kids club too : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The bathroom itself is small and I was quite surprised that we had no bath tub in the room : []
Finally the hotel made me change my booking room and provided two connecting rooms : []
The Spa facilities were amazing, we had massages every second day and felt like royalty throughout the experience : []
30 minutes later we had a delightful porter show us to our room, as well as giving a quick guide of the resort and facilities on offer in the room, a tip well-earned for this young man! : []
We stayed in a Palace Club Room and Palace Club Suite (interconnecting) and what a great experience! From our flawless check-in at the Palace Club to our beautiful room and suite and the immaculate grounds of this hotel, we definitely felt like royalty! The pool area was lovely - especially enjoyed the poolside bar and restaurants, also the daily pool aquaerobics : []
and we also had In Indonesian night and were looking forward to the satay on offer but were sorely disappointed when only lamb skewers were available and were told the chicken was too expensive to give us yet chicken satay was offered everyday on the poolside menu : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Very memorable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
86 but their money change desk only gave you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All privileges given to the Palace members were much appreciated, such as afternoon teas and cocktails, and the staff is very well trained, always smiling, and very professional : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff is very friendly and courteous : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The resort, yes the resort was built in 1983 and it is showing its age with the stone work and pool tiles etc - some pool tiles in the "kids" pool were coming off and in fact I picked one up off the floor of the pool : []
The staff are truly amazing : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Great location, facility and service from attentive, professional and attentive staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']

The spa treatments were enjoyable with plenty to do : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
For a romantic break, it was the perfect location : []
As for the venue, it is out of date, shabby, and smells of sewerage : []
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
:D even they crossing at your balcony : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There was no time limit so you luck out (like I did) if a couple of 15 year olds take up camp there and hog the computer : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Indeed is an original balinese hotel, with specific furniture and style : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I fould this really unusual and odd : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Balinese structures the pools, the beach, the facilities are all very nice and well maintained : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
On the negative side, some of the hotel's facilities are rather old : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Good range of food and entertainment : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The breakfast buffet was huge and everything was so tasty! the guest room was a great size and very comfortable! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Premier Room, the premier rooms are beautiful, contrast to the modern design of the deluxe, the premier rooms have a deeper sense of Balanise charm : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The next cubicle along was the WC : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Great for family's with kids! Beach was clean out front : [u'overall', u'culture']
When that didn't guarantee their undivided attention, you had to physically get up and block their path of zombie like inattention : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
inside and out gave us the feeling of really being somewhere different : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms were cleaned everyday and the service was wonderful, we noticed one time the cleaners had actually picked up our clothes from the floor and folded them for us - something I am not used to! We were in a corner room and were right next to the stair case to go to ground level, we didn't really hear much noise outside, but you could hear the cleaner's cart some days : []
Overall this is a great hotel to stay in, for family it is a great place, : []
But it's a great experience : []
Lovely staff, whom we have gotten to know better each year we visit : []

extra 23 USD each for Breakfast which is more than the hotel rate : [u'amenities', u'conference']
While the hotel is starting to show its age in some areas it still is a wonderful place to chill out and pamper yourself : []
Our bed was comfy, and the room was quiet : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

The midle and back garden is beatiful, and the breakfast choices and taste was not bad : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We never left the resort : []
air condition was good only during night period : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
The beach is not so good (swimming only with high tide), and if you are staying in Bali you might want to consider staying in a less touristic area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Although the hotel was member of LHW, the staff didn't know about the leaders club that I have joined : []
Overall recommend and would visit again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Other than, yes, definitely will recommended to friend : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We can recommend everyone tot visit nusa dua beach hotel : []
- The price of food and drink in the hotel needs a serious review - it is laughably expensive : []
Starting from entry of the hotel to the back side which is actually the beach front, the entire facility is a perfect family destination : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Checkers restaurant is lovely for dinner : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast watching the ducks, squirrels, monitor lizards and other wildlife was so relaxing and provided calming oasis that was so much needed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
e Nusa Dua is widely regarded as the nicest beach on the island) (ii) the wide variety of food and beverage outlets, as well as the high quality food and services : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The rooms were ok but fairly dated : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We are in a palace club room, on the ground floor, it's spacious and opens directly on to the temple garden area with pond and is so peaceful, actually we've found pretty much the entire resort peaceful : [u'amenities', u'pool']
You sat down and a few minutes later you had smoker move in on both sides : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

00pm checkout the next day : [u'location', u'sea']
We got a mixed up order : []
Eg the Italian restaurant would not do spaghetti bolognese! The best food we had was room service : []
One drawback was that we had asked for adjoining rooms when we booked which was several months previously : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The receptionist's service is poor : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Also, there are a few nice restaurants out the main gate or a short taxi ride : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
My husband enjoyed the cocktails, food, breakfast especially and the array of tv channels : [u'overall', u'culture']

Staff , the best , location outstanding , hotel great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Not far from the airport (but far enough that is doesn't disturb) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We stayed here for 7 nights at the Palace Chub Room : []
Changing the linen three times made no difference - it always felt damp : []
Unfortunately our rooms could not have been further apart : [u'amenities', u'patio']

Chess Beachfront Restaraunt is a good spot to have a dinner on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Okay so a little more expensive with regards to food and drinks compared to Seminyak/Kuta but you are staying at a hotel in a luxury area of Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One word of warning - the balinese locals have a massage unit at end of complex and tend to be a bit pushy! just dont go there : [u'location', u'general']
Hotel is very big and beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I will definitely come back to this hotel as the personal touch the housekeeper did for my daughter as well : [u'overall', u'culture']
The suites are very comfortable but not necessarily the most amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Had a Palace Club room which I highly recommend : []
Only bad thing at hotel is winelist, no Bali wine from Hatten producer like before, with special request we could get bottle oh Jepun Rose from Raja, but otherwise at The Lobbu, Chess bar, room service palace club, only sort list of wine's which we didnt like and only one sparkiling wine option, that reduce our experience at Hotel's restaurants and bars also there wasnt problem to skip free cocktail's at Palace club because of wine selection : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We still enjoyed our visit and look forward to returning for our next couple of weeks in February : []
We do tolerate being short changed : []
Seriously, fork out for one in the spa (30% off in the morning - but ours were included - I know, great deal) : []
We were so impressed we have just booked another holiday at the hotel for June 2015 and will be bringing ten other family and friends with us for my daughters 30th birthday : []
My only regret was that I could stay only one night : []
We booked this as part of a package and were very impressed! The lobby is lovely, the beach is clean, the pool is pretty : []
They also offer pick up and drop off for no charge although a tip is polite I would suggest : []
As a hotel guest, my only suggestion would be to ask for a room that doesn't face the construction (looks like a new resort being built) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Instead of moving us to a queen/ king bed they proceeded to join the two single beds : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This is our second trip to Bali,My husband, myself and 3 boys,We had a great time relaxing in the serenity of the resort,It offers the total feel of walking into comfort fresh open lobbies and : []

We were given the corner room so it was bigger than the ordinary room : []
We really the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We have just spent 4 glorious days at Nusa Dua Hotel Palace Club : []
Thankyou to all the staff who work at Nusa Dua Beach & Spa : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We have fallen in love with Bali and will be back : []
We loved it!!! : []
The place was bursting full : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Only advice to travelers is to exchange money before going to Nusa Dua : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Had most of our dinners at other hotels because the service was better : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If I had to nitpick bearing in mind the hotel's 5 star rating there have been a couple of minor points: The club doesn't enforce it's clearly stated no under 12s policy, no water or cold flannels are given out poolside and an apparent lack of red wine glasses for red wine in the lounge : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
We spent 10 days travelling around Bali and ended our trip with a 4 night stay here : []
I was so enjoy this hotel : []
They gave us complimentary champagne and decorated our room and bathroom with rose petals when they got to know that its our honeymoon : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Became vegetarian during breakfast as not halal : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This hotel offered us a great value for money : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The air conditioning worked well as it hit you how nice and cool the room was : []
But, anyhow, at least we could completely switch off : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
if possible , free wifi in rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
extremely poor internet and extracharge in the room for this? Hello! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Lots of food and beverage options within the facility : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I saw several times chairs "marked" with towels that were not used for the entire day while others walked around trying to find somewhere to sit : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We stayed at a deluxe ocean view room which was stylish, spacious and, like the rest of the hotel, full of traditional Balinese character : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The surroundings are tranquil, the gardens are beautiful and as nature lovers you have the Nusa Dua family of ducks that are a great source of entertainment to watch as well as the cheeky squirrels that every morning greet you and pretty much frolic around the palm trees occasionally landing on your patio where they are quite happy to gently take a grape or two from you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I will definitely return to this hotel on pleasure grounds next time - and try out the club facilities which looked rather special : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The breakfast area has a huge pond with lots of fishes, that meant, he ate without fuss (he was feeding the fishes and i was feeding him!) : []
I was able to try three types of room classes during my stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : []

This was a very enjoyable experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Staying at many hotels we were very impressed with the breakfast bar here : []
We ate at the Italian restaurant beside the pool which although we found food to be okay, service and prices weren't great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The beaches were very crowded and we were not able to swim, because the water was quite cold with lots of sea weed : [u'amenities', u'pool']
There's a good choice of food, although due to the nature of the resort and the higher tax rate in Nusa Dua, food and drink at the hotel are similar to European/US prices : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
A fabulous relaxing holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Another quieter option we discovered was the lap pool by the spa : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The restaurants were very expensive and very mediocre : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
I love the character of the place, elegant and refined, tastefully luxurious while still retaining the character and context of the place : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
8 meters, which I truly liked, and there was a bar in the middle of the swimming pool too : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Everything works well and the showers are excellent : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
This was a joke : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Arrived back to find my room double locked : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
A nice balcony opening to the gardens which was perfect for the children to run and play while we watched : []

- breakfast staff (one or two) got a little above themselves when I asked for a fresh watermelon juice ("sorry, not available today)" : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Otherwise it is one fantastic hotel with best value for money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

Ate most nights at the neraby shopping centre with plenty of restaurants : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
I recently stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa with my husband and children : []
The only downside was the smell in the bathroom and the little bugs all over the rattan table in our room : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Great hotel, very helpful and friendly staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would definately stay in Nusa Dua as the beach is nicer compared to Kuta area and it is much more peaceful : []
During low tide, you can walk a considerable distance out towards the sea : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel was fie and we had a nice time : []
A new restaurant is under construction near the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The evening dinning was uninspired, service was sparse and the food not that terrific : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
And taxis are cheap so it's not much of a problem : []
Then i had the Ritual massarge this was fantastic made me feel so relaxed and care free (what holidays are about in my book), : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
It may sound petty, but not very relaxing married with a noise of the drills : []
The rooms are nice but $300 per night for the most basic room is fairly outrageous, especially when you're expected to pay extra for wifi in the room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff very pleasant, room was spacious and clean : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Being stayed in this nice hotel for few times within a year : [u'location', u'sea']
The Gecko club was perfect for the 7 yr old but did not hold heaps of interest for the 9 yr old : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Breakfast at Palace Club was simple and sufficient (much better for those of us who can't help overeating at buffet's), although we did go to the main buffet breakfast once and that was a fairly standard buffet for a good hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only bad thing was the constant rainy weather : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was easy accomomdated : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We gave up! : []
The staff are friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
In particular the whole fish (which we commented on exactly the same, 6 months ago) and the hot seafood - all overcooked to the max : []
There are three pools at the hotel, one in the spa and then two by the main area of the hotel, both are gorgeous and very clean : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Would recommend it : []
The staffs are extreme helpful and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We found the Balinese restaurant expensive and quite bland : []
The pool/bar dining area is in a wonderfull setting right off the beach, making it a special time and place for lunch : []
Friendly staff Breakfast very nice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also, it gets a bit crowded on week-ends : []
For families with kids the large complex with direct access to a clean beach offers almost everything and is a sort of paradise -- like others before (check other recent reviews), you will be delighted from this unique hotel experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Authentic Bali great staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Bathroom lovely, although shower was not strong enough : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Well at least until I did the whitewater rafting! We had a great room and views and a comfy bed - very good housekeeping : []
If you like to have breakfast served to you in a lounge setting looking out over a wide expanse of gardens, drop in for afternoon tea or evening cocktails go for a Palace Club room it's worth the extra : []

The hotel is pleasant enough - the grounds are large and green (though not as well kept as they could be), it has 3 swimming pools, one of which is a lap pool for serious swimming and the beach is well kept, though with some litter in the sea : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']

The restaurants within the resort and outside are very expensive with average food : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The bathroom was very spacious with separate shower, bathtub, and toilet which were very handy given that there were three of us staying : []
I understand that it's a difficult thing, but I have thought about a couple of solutions to fix it : []
i hope back to this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed at the club which has a beautiful setting but when we arrived at 4pm taken from the airport by a hotel car so they knew when we would be there, the room was not ready and we had to wait another hour before getting a room, Not a good way to start : []

We took a long trip to an ancient temple, Tanah Lot : []
There's pool side dining, beach side dining but we took a stroll and had a fabulous meal at Westin (and befriended a terrific dude) next door : []
Food quality was poor : [u'overall', u'safety']
Definately try Tropical, an easy 10 minute stroll, or they will pick you up/drop you off (complimentary) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The best thing about the hotel - it is just so easy : []
to the airconditioning : []
Hotel is nice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
However, if you walk just outside the hotel there are a number of restaurants that are much cheaper and we found the food to be of a very high quality : []
Felt very safe at the resort, had to go through 2 security check points : [u'location', u'sea']
There is a nice walk about a mile each way along a tree lined footpath : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

I mention this as many previous reviews have been critical of this aspect so I guess it all depends on what you expect in terms of speed and coming from the middle east with low speed internet I can only say we were pleasantly surprised : [u'overall', u'culture']
I hope they can improve the variety of the food in the future : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The restaurants were ok, if not exciting and the business centre is very good in offering free internet and printing : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Only negative comments are that the seafood all tends to be grilled and somewhat over cooked, which dries it out a bit : [u'amenities', u'conference']
unbelievable breakfast buffet! and all the restaurants were great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My wife loved her spa treatments, which were part of the deal but otherwise fairly priced : [u'amenities', u'conference']

this is trip number 21 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I will however note that it was not as clean as I would expect of a hotel room and one of the shower heads (there were 2) sprayed everywhere but downwards, leaving the whole bathroom soaked : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Cost of mini bar items were too expensive : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I'm not surprised that the lounge bar was so poorly attended : [u'amenities', u'patio']
you will need a car there cuz you are a bit away from the crowded area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pizza bar is the best! We had lots of those and my kids want to go back just to have more : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We would like to give a special mention to Ginastra and his team, they were exceptional in their service and level of professionalism and are a true asset to the resort - thank you for making us feel welcome, relaxed and pampered : []
We didn't choose this hotel : []
, although it's not necessary as most speak English : []
If you had a lap top you could plug in to a connection in your room but you had to pay extra to use it - approx $5 for 1 hour : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pools were so nice and never felt noisy or crowded : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']

3- You never get a drink properly cold : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is not a modern minimalist place, which is great because it still have a touch of Balinese influence to it without being too traditional : []
Our room was clean and nicely appointed, only negative for me was the in-room mini bar fridge was very small and we were travelling with an infant so ok room for bottles but would have been handy to have some additional space for the actual mini bar items themselves (we had to empty it to allow for the milk and baby bottles) : []
we had a small problem with our first room which was rectified immediately by change of room/upgrade : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Check in was pretty shaky as we arrived at 2:30 and still had to wait 1 1/2 hours for our rooms to be made up : []
I say stay here just for the more interesting design of the hotel if you're looking for a resort in the Nusa Dua area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Fire dance night was disappointing : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
But breakfast menus were boring and not that tasty : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
However, after that we were then told that the room would not be ready till 6 pm! We were offered another room, and we were assured it was not going to be noisy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Nusa Dua is an extremely quiet spot, which has it's good and bad points, but overall Nusa Dua lacks the exciting chaos that most people love Bali for : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Lovely rooms, excellent breakfast, great pool, cheeky pool bar, good restaurants at reasonable prices, and lots of little cocktail bars all along the island at neighbouring hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
When you stay here try to get up early and see the sunrise and walk along the path connecting all the beautiful hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I certainly intend to visit again and have no hesitation in recommending this resort-hotel to others : []
By the way the buffee breakfast need to be review : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
It's old and stale, dreary decor! Breakfast was ordinary, lunch at chess bar was a little better : []
I will remember this trip for all of its highlights but also being a part of these gentle people who live in such a peaceful way and never complain : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We were offered a welcome drink in the bar and after a while I politely asked if we could have a couple of complimentary beers while we waited : []
When we drove up to the hotel, it was very impressive! We were given an upgrade to a club room and it was fabulous! Great view of the garden, the best bathroom I have seen in a long time, with a separate toilet with a tub that opened to the bedroom! Only criticism, no where to hang your towels! The lap pool is brilliant as are the free activities offered by the gym; we did the bike ride around Nusa Dua : []
The staff were courteous and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Breakfast every morning was magnificent and had a wide selection from which to choose : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Transfers to airport etc great : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Misc: Be warned that when you get off the flight and before collecting your luggage you have to pay $35 each for a enrty VISA and then queue for about hour through customs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast, high tea, and the evening cocktail hours were all held here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Set amongst beautiful tranquil gardens with friendly attentive staff and next to a lovely beach this is the perfect short holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Excellent beach and 4 pools to choose from : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
several pools with great amenities, lots of greenery everywhere with blooming flowers is a great experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort had too many people trying to sell things : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Lovely people, of course - as anyone who has been to Indonesia would anticipate : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Drinks are quite expensive though, particularly the wine : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
My daughter had opted for a better room, they had a private dining room for breakfast and afternoon tea, but the buffet breakfast was great and you are really spoiled for choice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We have just come back from another lovely time at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
we stayed 3 days as our honeymoon : []
you have it all : []
The room was great it had everything we needed : []
We could go on : []
A walk up and down the beach is a must early in the visit to see the neighbouring food and liesure offerings : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Lastly I would like to give a big thank you to all the staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This time we Stayed 8 nights in July on a luxury escape package- premier room with vip airport service : []
Breakfast was unbelievable : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Our second time at this Hotel amazing surroundings, staff,food and accomodation : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Turtles have laid there eggs on the beach and the hotel protects them until they hatch : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
they basically rip you off : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Great variety of fruits though : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
You can hire bikes, play tennis, there is a gym, spa, shops, almost everything is available : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach area is kept clean and tidy and due to the reef head being someway out the bay does not suffer from wave wash so is ideal for swimming when the tide is in, however the bay seems devoid of sea life and so snorkelling Is a disappointment : [u'overall', u'culture']
We are heading on a four day trip and look forward to coming back to nusa dua : []
Our daughter has a walking disability, and we felt that the grounds and layout of the place was very accessible - lifts to all floors also : [u'overall', u'safety']
We stayed with our 6 year old daughter and she enjoyed the pools and beach area : [u'overall', u'culture']
We live in Darwin so used to the weather : [u'location', u'sea']
The grounds are lovely and very central to other hotels within mins walking distance : [u'overall', u'safety']
Overall, I (we) love it!! Definitely will go back again in our top list hotel in Bali : []
Beware of the scammers giving away 'scratchy prize tickets' : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The entire resort area is accessible, including the beach side bar which is at sit down height meaning wheelies can easily enjoy a cocktail at the bar also : [u'amenities', u'conference']
- Staff were very polite, friendly and well trained : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Service was excellent and the location and surroundings are idyllic : [u'amenities', u'shopping']

Two weeks spent in this amazing hotel, filled with friendly trustworthy and social staff : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The hotel, surroundings & presentation were impeccable : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We hope to be back one day : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The rooms were very clean, the food tastes good and there was a lot of variety and the staff was excellent in attending to your needs : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
You have to get down poolside early to reserve your deck chair, or you'll miss out : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
very comfortable and well equipped bedrooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
All through this, the one thing that stood out was the service attitude of the staff : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Its good place to relax after busy week and good place for honey moon couple who prefer to stay in serene place without any amusement night (cos its too far to go! and family with kids : [u'amenities', u'patio']
- most food is very nice, and yes much more expensive as elsewhere in Bali which is logical: food quality and service is much better, you get nice tableware and you are sitting right to a clean beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Plus as its right on the Nusa Dua beach, you can pop right out into the ocean, do some kayaking or SUP and be back at your room in minutes : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a really blissful week together there and talked about a bigger family gathering at some stage down the track : []
Closer to the hotel we tried a restaurant outside the gates called Tropicana which was very reasonable : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Loved the squirrels and ducks and care of the beautiful gardens : [u'amenities', u'garden']
My husband and I recently returned from our fourth enjoyable visit to NDBH : [u'overall', u'culture']
Feel bad giving this review but wish I had done better research before booking! Would not stay here again would stay at Mulia! : []
Attentive and friendly staff, rooms in very good shape and an abundance of poolside and beachside areas we could not have been happier with our stay : []
The Food - one word Fantastic I never was stuck for something to eat as the choice at all the meal and cocktails were great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
We spend two idyllic weeks here, and found the staff friendly and helpful every minute of the day : []
A few of the nights we actually headed to the local shopping centre (there is a shuttle bus which goes from the hotel) which had a great variety of restaurants, which were better priced and also got us out of the resort as the resort was very quiet at night : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We chose the right place to stay : []
We have stayed i Nusa Dua Beach hotel & spa 4 times in the last 15 years : []
The buffet breakfast was fine but paying on average 40-50 U : []
And of course, those chip'n dales are really adorable : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
etc the staff is very friendly and cooperative : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Selections are huge but it's not that tasty (compared to another hotel I was staying in the other days) : []
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa was the perfect hotel and garden to truly relax and be spolt by the wonderful and efficient staff, whose friendly and professional nature ensured that each individual experience felt unique : [u'overall', u'feel']
The balcony overlooked the pool and the beach : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
The hotel is built in grand Balinese style as opposed to some of the more modern style of surrounding hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Things I love and the main reason I picked this resort to stay: : []
If you are after other options Bali Collection is a 10 minute walk or 3 minute drive : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Recommend that you dont overthink everything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Do you mind to keep the Air Condition at your restaurant, especially from the smoking area who stand side by side with the non smoking area (always close the door so the smoke did not reach the no smoker : []
Very nice hotel facility, delicious food (you can choose between several restaurants), incredibly friendly staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
always ready to assist with enquiries : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
The staff were friendly and efficient, always a nice smile : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Food: The buffet breakfast was amazing, the best I have ever had : []
Lots of hotels in the area are austere and very grandiose : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only minor improvement with be a touch of varnish on all the handrails on the balconies and a little wear and tear : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
We stayed in a palace club room, which was so comfortable, and the breakfast, tea, and cocktail buffet in the afternoon were all excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Overall, it's a reccomended place to stay in Bali : []
this is the reason why my family would stay there too long : [u'overall', u'culture']
The beach front has good arrangement in case you want to just sit and relax : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And that is what we got at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It's worth it to upgrade to the palace rooms so you get free drinks & food at the happy hour : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room was quite worn out : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I had heard a lot about this hotel, but ended up incredibly disappointed : []
Walking the beach front in both directions you'll notice the newer, 'western' 5 star places are cold and sterile by comparison and lack the tradition, warmth and character that abounds at this resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
2nd pool will be given face-lift later this year : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
It's good for the kids, also (I don't have, but it's a place they would love) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
friendly staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nothing can say about accommodation which was absolutely great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We enjoyed an afternoon in the spa which again went above and beyond our expectations : [u'amenities', u'conference']
There are also plenty of restaurants to choose plus outside the entry to the Nusa Dua Resorts is also a small village with a market atmosphere with local restaurant options : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Many thanks for a wonderful holiday and we hope to return soon : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staying in a tourist complex, a gated part of Bali, is weird : [u'location', u'general']
wonderful rooms with direct pool excess or sea views,The service and food at the hotel were very good, as was the spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We used the gym, spa, sauna and steam room facilities which are all very nice : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I am from HK so actually don't think the balinese style in the hotel is not such balinese : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I stayed at Nusa Dua Resort from May 27th to June 1st with my family : []
I have stayed at other hotels where 4-5 hours the norm is : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Hotel was lovely, pool was amazing and spent many hours soaking up the sun : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The bathtub in the room should be installed the other way around : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are also convenience stores for things like Bintang beer, soft drinks and water that are a fraction of the resort prices (e : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We choose a Palace Club room and we recommend this option : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
That is sad if it is true : []
We enjoy the relaxing atmosphere : []
Very pleasant stay, would come again : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You'll thank me for it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Specially because we stay at room type deluxe for 4, the room so comfortable : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Do be careful if you plan to visit the temples : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall the hotel was fantastic, everything was in order, everyone was really nice and friendly, the kids loved being there with us, and we all had a ball : []
This section of beach gets lots of seaweed etc washing up : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Although comical we were both a little injured : []
My wife spent the whole week taking care about the orchids : [u'overall', u'culture']
There is a most peaceful sense when you stay in this room, the birds chirp outside you window and everything is very settled : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Squirrels are awesome! Daugther was overwelmed by feeding them with nuts on our balcony and on the beach : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The staff was very attentive and polite : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The yoga instructor is so delightful : []
This can again be remedied by proper housekeeping the floor can be cleaned then vacuumed after : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The wedding was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen so if anyone is considering it for that then i would recommend it : []
The pools look quite nice but you cannot get a lounge after 10am, mostly due to guests putting a towel & newspaper on them in the morning & not returning until the afternoon if at all : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But the bed is lovely : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
With the squirrels that come to feed from your balcony it is a wonderful retreat : []
I stayed there for a week in the month of May : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Buffet breakfast was less than average - not much of a choice and half the hot food on offer was stone cold on most mornings - even though we were usually there at 7 : []
and outside of the hotel, it can be difficult to exchange your money for the best rate if your money is bent, wrinkled or torn a bit (very surprising!!) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel has very nice interior design with just the right amount of Balinese artifacts without giving it an atmosphere of a temple : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
After a week in Ubud, we moved closer to beach and stayed here : []
They also set up some personal wedding props, a speaker system, a mike and a dance stage which allowed for speeches, the waltzes and some booty shaking : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Only disappointment was the kids club : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
You can not miss it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our son (6) used the kids club but it was a real shame that there weren't more kids there for some sessions : [u'overall', u'culture']
The doors leading to the pool area wouldn't lock, tv reception was so poor that it was unwatchable : []
The lobby bar was a great place to finish the day : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Nothing is too much bother for the staff, from the management to the ground staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Wonderful and relaxing stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thankyou to all staff at this hotel for making this a superb holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Peaceful and tranquil grounds, inviting pools and top class amenities : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Cool lounge area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Palace Club is the main draw card for me to this resort as the service is exceptional : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
As for the sun beds, if you were up early or before about 9 you were ok, you have the usual people that set there alarms,but normaly you were ok,we always got our towels and beds then went down to breakfast, Which is really good,lots too choose from hot and cold : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa is ideal for a get away from it all, lay by the pool type holiday : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The spa sessions were lovely and thoroughly enjoyed : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We returned home this morning from our 11 night stay at the resort : []
The cake delivered to our room the morning of his birthday to the wonderful romantic dinner on the evening of his special day on the beach, it was perfect : []
Special thanks to all the staff, particularly Gin, Nona, Sugi, Rasni, Anik, Wardana, who made our stay a memorable one : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were not disappointed the good at Raja Balinese was amazing and I loved their lemongrass, honey ginger and coconut ice cream flavors : []
Staff in club lounge would hel with anything you needed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Service , food quality , assistance ,beauty , the private secluded beach of the Resort were excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If you cant relax here you might as well give up : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We travelled all the way from London which took us about 15 hours and then to arrive at a five star hotel without even a mention of a drink is unacceptable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The same food on different days varied and some days stale : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The bed was really comfortable, storage plentiful and the marble bathroom a good size (although I did think it was the one thing that was looking a little tired and dated) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
At first, i had doubt that the resort would be a pleasant one due to its 30 years old age, so I kept my expectation low : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is truly a little piece of heaven : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
As for the Bali, it's disgusting, horrible, boring, very dirty, retailers are begging you for money, harassment buy shop owners, cap drivers, anyone and everyone, : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
At the same time to all Balinese working in different places for making us feel so special : []
There are plenty of facilities to utilise within the resort to keep yourself entertained : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The change rooms are designated male or female and include jacuzzis' and steam room, all inclusive : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I just adore the architecture & layout of the grounds : []
When you enter from the gate you will feel that you are in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Affordable kids menu are available for room service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If you're looking for an authentic Balinese experience you're probably not going to find it here, but if you want a bit of resort luxury then this is for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The bathroom was also good, with a decent shower and separate bath tub : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Having only stayed here for two nights my thoughts are about whether the hotel met my expectations : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The service is outstanding : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our room was very nice and was wooden and marble throughout and we had the most beautiful view of the garden from our room, pink and lilac flowers everywhere, the hotel is very well kept : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This hotel was beautiful !! The staff are lovely and the attention to detail through out the hotel is beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We had a lovely view in the mornings : []
Location changes to the theatre dinners were also not provided, we had to walk around to find where to go : []
Friendly courteous and helpful staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
PS: only saw one Bintang singlet within the resort, so refreshing for Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
I highly recommend this property to families and honeymooners alike : [u'room', u'furniture']
I can say this was my favorite hotel in nusa dua and Iv seen the other hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is tidal, luckily for us high tide was from midday till late afternoon, not so great if you wanted an early morning swim : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The food in all the eateries was very, very good with a great choice to suit all needs and taste : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We have stayed here 4 times (most recently in May) and each time the service has been amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We left an iPhone 5 in his car on another short trip which he promptly returned to the hotel for them to give to us, it was in the hotel managers hand before we even knew it was missing!! : []
I had a great experience in this hotel the staff was wonderful and it had everything I needed, the beach and the pool great places just to relax also room service was great overall the Balinese atmosphere of the hotel was breath taken beautiful gardens and staff : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
the balcony had amazing garden,fountain and pond views : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
verry nice hotel with friendly staff and excelent food, if you are a food lover you must go here, everything they serve is perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We've stayed in palace rooms and deluxe rooms - do palace if you want the extras, or don't and buy your cocktails at happy hour at the beachfront Chess Bar instead, and spend the extra on local cuisine - this was our preference : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I enjoyed the private beach very much and due the time we went, there weren't many people at all! it was amazing and relaxing! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Once again like all resorts in Bali I recommend a ground floor room with a pool or beach view after all it's a shame to come all that way and not fully enjoy your time : [u'location', u'sea']
It was our first time in Bali and this hotel and the area were is located is just perfect : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Gecko kids club lacks a little enthusiasm from some of the helpers, at times : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The spa is an experience on its own : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
But, if i may give suggestion to the hotel i would suggest the hotel to do some renovations : []
We stayed in a premier room only because of the quiet location : []
I recommend staying in Seminyak, it's quieter than Kuta but lots of nice places to eat and things to do : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We travel to Bali every year and always stay in Seminyak : []
Their pool is crystal clear and has a nice swim-up bar : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
In some nights you may hear the plains decollating : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staying at Nusa Dua was a lot quieter than staying in Seminyak but not a problem as we arranged for a driver if we wanted to go anywhere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
The only problem I had is the same buffet breakfast provide everyday : [u'amenities', u'conference']
When I reached the hotel, one of the attendant took a bag and disappeared : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This hotel fully met this requirement : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We booked 3 day trips with the hotels driver- Mr Youdana, who is so patient and considerate especially if you are travelling with kids : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A great hotel - felt safe, secure and happy at all times during our stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We absolutely loved this place as soon as we arrived : []
The spa also has a lap pool with nice chaise lounges for relaxing, and a nice relaxation room : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Consequently - we are going back again for March break : []
The staff were very cutious and attentive; the hotel offers many activities for children and adults therefore we could just laze around the pool/beach or get up and be active : []
Thought the food in club at happy hour not as good as last time,but great at other times : [u'location', u'sea']
Beautiful beach resort and one of the oldest in Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Stayed for 9 nights in a deluxe room, Bed comfortable, and excellent bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
There was construction of another restaurant so this may have contributed to the limited menu around the pool area & beach! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We enjoyed this hotel very much : []
The food in all of the restaurants was very good, but the Palace Club was not as good as in on our first stay : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The beach waters were having lot of weeds, we were told it happens on some days : []
We stayed for two days : []
Our children used the kids club on and off and enjoyed the activities particularly Indonesian day and movie night : [u'overall', u'culture']
No aircon in front lobby : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
We spent 9 days here and found the hotel to suit our needs : []
You will pay well under half the price the hotel would have charged you : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Its a shame when remembering a holiday that was in most parts so pleasurable , that the first night when a Free flow drinks option was on offer with dinner that the lasting memory was having Houdini as our drinks waiter , this one act was a mistake by the staff ,an otherwise helpful friendly and informed staff has been criticized by his disappearing act : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
over all the room was dreadful, with broken slats into the bathroom from the bedroom, also a damaged shower head : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
We stayed at the Palace Club room which is a very nice room which opens right into the garden : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Room was excellent and comfortable, effective air conditioning and well maintained : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The staff were delightful, though I must say I found the trainee staff (there were many of them) far more pleasant that the permanent staff : []
I am a Irish male in my early 30s who has travelled to many countries and destinations around the world : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We had some massages that were excellent, room service when asked for was perfect : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Dinners were dissapointing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Thankful there was a free shuttle service to Bali Collection which offered many retaurants & shops much cheaper : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Not a great deal of activities, but these weren't far away by a taxi : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The cakes were scrumptious, I only wish I could order one the same from home : []
(Our room being close to reception was able to pickup free WiFi : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
My wife and I stayed at this hotel recently for 9 nights along with our two small children (1 & 3) : [u'overall', u'culture']
This hotel has several restaurants all good, eating by the beach was lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
We stayed here on our first trip to Bali : []
I will come again : []
It's clean and the water is beautiful : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Great value for money! The only drawback is the location which is a little bit far from all the sites but at least is in a very quiet and safe area where all the big hotels are : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The only aspect of the hotel that came to my attention as something that needed a change was the chairs on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Staff were attentive and very helpful - stands out were Nour (massage therapist) and Anita (breakfast run) - and most importantly non-intrusive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Staff lovely : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Forgot to mention a trip to Jimbaren Bay to one of the numerous fish restaurants on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
there's a lot of building work on the roads so traffic is very bad : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
We were pleasantly surprised as the photos on the website didn't really do this place a justice, however I have been told by the management that they are in the process of upgrading the photographs : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
A special thanks to the assistant Palace Club manager Nyoman Sadnyana very helpful and friendly, great butler service from Ayu and all the others in this area they seem to be hand picked for your own requirements : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
In this day and age it's unforgivable for a resort of this class not to provide such a basic service : []
Western an local foods : [u'location', u'general']
If you want 5 star accomodation away from it all, with full relaxation stay in Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For a 6 night stay, it was very mediocre : []
You can take the free bus to the shopping centre and then negotiate a deal with one of taxis that are lined up there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
this DID NOT happen! We were bitterly disappointed in KUTA, the people were rude, pushy & threatening : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Spa treatments very professional : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But despite the food the ambiance is exceptional and the staff so kind and lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The hotel wanted 190,000 to the airport as an example : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Could I justify staying here at list prices given the additional expenses of wining and dining ? : []
Usually two or three of the five computers were not working and they were also very slow : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Staff and grounds were lovely but we will never stay again at the Nuca Dua hotel : []
Only suggest to people would like to spend whole day in the hotel as not much shopping can do there (only Bali Collection) : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
Great way to end a fantastic three weeks in beautiful Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
It was quiet and relaxing, nice Beach, friendly and helpful people, good management : []
The staff are exceptional and make you feel like part of their family : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Last one is the middle area between rear stairs and pool is dark, unused, and seem like a waste : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I thought the hotel food prices were quite pricey so we went to an Indian restaurant every single day : []
Although we reported it no one came to fix it : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The resort was very nice, excellent staff and service, but I booked my stay online specifying that we needed a room for 3 persons and upon arrival was charged double the price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Set only a few metres from the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Amazing holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only things that are good is a great beach, breakfast and location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms were fixed too, new flat screens, new furnitures, our suite had table and 4 chairs, chairs are funny, when sit you have to held hands high to be able to eat, luckly there is pillows with they help on chair can eat : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Staff and service was excellent ! : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
What will cost you $5 at the laundrymat in Melbourne will cost you $70 easily here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Checking out was the only negative thing i can think off, staff did a great job and was accurate : []
Plently of wonderful restaurants with entertainment around the area - with free transport! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our suite was lovely, big, clean and inviting : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE going on a honeymoon to Bali : []
The hotel will arrange a pick up : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
room service and house keeping was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Staff assigned to other locations are quite attentive and okay : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
i didnt see in the food menu "arabs food" : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Stayed there for 3 nights : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Beach was okay but a bit weedy : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
I normally write long reviews but will keep this one short : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
we did a half day treatment, and it was wonderful! It is directly on the beach, which was perfect for post dinner walking around : []
There are lots of different events going on at the hotel, the traditional Balinese meal and dancing is really good although again, a bit pricey : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Looking forward to my next visit : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
We are return customers Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa, this year we brought along a few family members : []
The sports facilities were always available and not busy, which was great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We had an excellent hotel in Malaysia and were a bit concerned that the Nusa Dua might be an anti-climax : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Upon our arrival in Denpasar, we were a little nervous because we were unsure if our driver would be there on time to get us and he was!! He drove us into Nusa Dua from the airport : []
My firs visit was so wonderful I had to go back : []
Breakfast is included in the room rate and thank goodness there are scales in our bathroom otherwise we would have eaten more of the delicious food each day!!! We will certainly be returning here next year and hopefully the years after that : []
I was initially skeptical (too good to be true?!) but was put at ease almost upon arrival : []
The stretch of beach where the resort is located accommodates 5-6 other 4-5 star nice resorts, but they are all south of it, and they dont benefit as much from the sea breeze as it does, which is very important on a hot & humid Bali afternoon with a beer or cocktail in hand : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Get a premier room as a deluxe is awful : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We visited with a Luxury Escapes deal and we were very disappointed : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Everything seemed clean and well-maintained : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Fantastic hotel, very helpful and friendly staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Does it have beautiful pools and surrounds : []
4- The hotel management is obsessed with imposing restrictions : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There was only one minor fault the bar prices were a bit up there : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I hope more tourists come back to Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
I've never been so spoiled! : []
I would love to be informed if you are going ahead with another luxury escapes package as we would love to return : []
Staff very helpful and friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We visited the resort in October 2013 : []
We all got standard room, I think : []
Booked 2 palace club rooms for the family inc 2 adult kids age 19 and 17 : [u'overall', u'culture']
The facilities were fabulous - the gym, pool, and tennis and squash courts - awesome! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There were plenty of empty lounge chairs and the pool employees would bring free snacks for guests : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I spent 5D4N trip in Bali with my wife and 18months baby boy : []
we really mean it : []
Food and beverage prices at the high end compared to general restaurant meals in Bali -prices were more like dining out in Australia : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
It is huge : []
Kids table with crayons and coloring papers to occupy them during breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
In the beach, our opinion is that the area should be improved : [u'location', u'general']
The gardens are immaculate and beautiful, there are lovely ponds with huge koi carp : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Only $10 taxi ride to Kuta and really appreciated peace and quite when back at resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Definately upgrade to having the Palace Club Privileges as it saves you more than what you paid on drinks/food etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach vendors are friendly and respectful : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Ample things to do in the hotel for kids and babies : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you're after something to blow your mind, try St Regis up the road : [u'amenities', u'garden']
However the Palace Club team provide exceptional service and make it hard to think about staying anywhere else, : []
Made Karmadanarta for giving us the best customer service experience ever, if you want to have the best customer service experience, don't be hesitate to choose Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa, for a great place to stay in Bali!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- Day spa was amazing (worth paying for a massage here rather than a cheap one down the street!) : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
We stayed for nine days and enjoyed it : []
When we enter the hotel, the ambiance of bali is there, "Gapura" with bali carving : [u'overall', u'spacious']
I cant understand the size of the TVs or lack of DVD player : []
Very glamorous hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
When we arrived at the hotel our bags were all sorted and carried for us and upon checking in we were upgraded which was very nice : [u'amenities', u'conference']
All can say is I WANT TO GO BACK : []
- Beach was lovely and you could swim at the beach! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Still the hotel arranged driver is very reasonable by international standards and a safer choice, but we like the adventure of finding our own way at times : []
I can't remember the price but it was not expensive, the plate was much bigger than we expected and the fruit was delicious : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
You have a superb stretch of beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Absolutely beautiful resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The bathrooms are larger and the floor space of the room is quite nice : [u'overall', u'spacious']
We walked to Bali Collections for dinner and had a nice meal, we couldn't believe the prices of massages here! : []
The best thing about staying in this resort area within Nusa Dua is the peace and quiet compared to Kuta/Legian : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua Beach H&S is the best hotel in the area : [u'location', u'general']
This was not a problem for us though as we were so tired each day (mostly from doing nothing) we slept like babies : []
Palace Club suite was a good size for us as we were travelling with a one year old : []
The price of alcohol at the hotel is expensive - but sitting in the pool at the swim up bar, I felt obliged to savour a local beer - waiter service excellent ! We would definitely return : []
Food was to die for and entertainment was a highlight with many of us Aussies dancing the night away on the dance floor : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
After spending 8 days in Legian it was a pleasure to come to NDBH and wind down : []
Great location, very grand, peaceful and tranquil gardens : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Exceptional personal service from all staff - from management to room service - at this beautifully appointed Balinese-style first-class resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The staff is so kind and keep on smiling : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Be warned though, the restaurants ain't cheap compared with the prices elsewhere on the island : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
As some reviews said, all deck-chairs with shade (parasol) around pools were all occupied with towels or books even at 08:00 in the morning : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We did think the hotel was missing a wow factor though : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Beds were very hard it took one day of little sleep to get used to them : []
It was a great value, as some of the other newer hotels down the beach were almost double! The staff was incredible in so many ways! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
And so yummy! We ate in all 4 restaurants and also had room service, and enjoyed them all : []
This is a stunning resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The service is excellent, and nothing was too much trouble : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We are traveling a lot but this was really excellent, amazing hotel and perfect service, thanks : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
(We paid $175 plus $20 for a room upgrade that included breakfast (excellent), service and taxes : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall we had a great experience and we will definitely return to Nusa dua Beach and Spa : []
Breakfast was extensive and amazing though! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
One advantage is that nearly every restaurant we went to offered free transport to and from the hotel : []
You do get approached by people selling things on the beach a lot though, you just have to be able to say "no thanks", often more than once : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pools are good but the beach is better with towels provided : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The grounds and pools were nice : [u'overall', u'safety']
Spa: Nice pool and games room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The bathroom effectively floods every time you take a shower : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The gardens and structures are impressive : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Later we contacted the hotel and we all upgraded to a Premier room with a pool view at $25USD per night : []
And to bring the docket with the food or drink please : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We will certainly be returning : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only issue we had is the kids pool is next to the pool bar : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Good pool choice and great beach all very close to rooms and dining : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
If you are looking for a resort which has lovely staff, nice pools, good food, and sporting activities all on one site, then this is for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All in all a great hotel, great staff, great spa, great holiday : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our overall experience in bali in this hotel was good : [u'overall', u'feel']
The honesty of the staff is to be commended : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We ate there once (room service) as it seemed very overpriced : []
Nice enough for the price however - 2 disappointing thing were; : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Markets also located at the gates of Nusa Dua a short walk from the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Five star hotel in Bali in a very quiet area and at the ocean with a a private beach makes your holiday a non forgetable time : [u'location', u'sea']
We have been in your resort many times and have always been happy but this time we found not proper service and poor quality for restaurants meals : []
On the other side the accommodation room and and its facility in the room condition OK : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
The staff were fantastic, REALLY friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
we had a serious issue which I will not get into, but this is NOT a hotel to trust your kids to : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We recently spent a week at this resort , our first as a family to Bali : []
Compared to the hotel website the hotel itself is dozens times more impressive than it looks on pictures and video : []
What a gorgeous representation of old Balinese architecture : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
It's a great place for a couple or families to go to : []
Training pool of 25 metres : [u'overall', u'culture']
Only downside (for a 5-star resort) is that the rooms are relatively small : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
On our honeymoon when we spent 3 nights in Bali, the location of Nusa Dua is fabulous : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
There were also table tennis tables, water aerobics and other balls and equipment that you can collect from the little hut : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They also provide a lot of amenities : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Definitely recommend the breakfast buffet : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Nothing was too much trouble : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel seemed to have kept the Balinese feel with a modern touch with all the facilities advertised and the price was affordable for a 4 star hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I went there 3 times and each time it was a different therapist all better the one from the other, the whole process makes you feel at ease and you are already relaxed before even beginning : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thanks to the GM Mr Urs Klee and your wonderful staff for a truly memorable holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
But these are unfounded : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We then waited for a room for 45 minutes : []
Breakfast was good with ample choice to suit all needs : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The cooking class at Raja's is a must but dont eat breakfast that morning!! 5min walk to Shopping Mall and local villages for shopping and eating : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We particularly liked the Spa Pool, as it was lovely and quiet, no-one under the age of 12, with a lovely pool, beds and umbrellas and changing rooms with Jacuzzi facilities, separate for male and female : []
Breakfast was amazing with so much to choose from, a highlight being the freshly made to order omelettes! Another highlight was dinner at sunset on the beach and afterwards being serenaded by the three local musicians who were performing that night at the resort!! We also found a wonderful driver/guide (Maday) that picked us up from Nusa Dua Hotel at very reasonable rates any time/day that we required : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
It is very easy to find taxi in Bali : []
We got complimentary wine and fruits in evening as well : []
I have to say, it was everything you could expect and more : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hotels has very big beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We recently were lucky enough for get a bargain price on Luxury escapes website for a trip to Bali staying at Nusa Dua Hotel : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
The pools were lovely and great for our young son to play in : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Everything was perfect! Food, staff etc were amazing! Would definitely come back hopefully soon & will bring friends with us : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My only complaint of the hotel is that internet use in the business lounge was very expensive - Suggest you take laptop/phone to use free WIFI in lobby : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We are just loving it! Total relaxation, serene, quiet : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The grounds were stunning (with small squirrels visiting our balcony every morning), pools were crystal clean and the spa facilities tranquil and not too crowded : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Great service, good food and nice rooms : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Lucky I have some peanuts so I get to hand-fed them everyday, they are very friendly! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The resort offers a real Balinese feel with its gardens and surrounds unlike other resorts in Nusa Dua that seem more western in style : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Swimming pools, playground and the beach are absolutely fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
You can always go to the Oasis Beach REsort up the road for something new : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
11:00 massage - in the Spa area anyway you like it for up to 1 hour : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Beautiful fountains and lakes all over The hotel! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
i wasted no time in going around the resort as i felt our length of stay to be insufficient to cover much ground : []
When we first saw the resort, the front lobby was very impressive : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Our 'garden deluxe' room was lovely : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Pools, & beach were great, & the choice of restaurants & bars was more than enough : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Dinner options were less interested after a few days - but there is a good walking mall down the road with shopping and restaurants : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
All in all a great place to go with or without children : [u'overall', u'culture']
We even saw a pool attendant reserving 2 lounges for someone! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Go at least once in your lifetime : [u'overall', u'culture']
Nice and peaceful away from the pool scene, tranquil view of ponds and geese, lots of trees : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The quality of the food is excellent at whichever restaurant you dine at and I would recommend that you try Rajas which specialises in Balinese cuisine : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Hotel Setting is nice/location fine : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Right after a big celebration, my husband and I had a little detour to Bali island : [u'location', u'sea']
Because I went for a meeting and I did not have to use much of the service in Hotel : []
Booking in and out was quick and efficient : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The only way to see some fish life is to hire one of the many boats from one of the beach vendors stalking the beach, and this is where things take a turn for the worse : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very good value for money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Enormous - we actually ended up either sharing one between two or ordered the kids meals which were about a normal sized adult meal in our world! The pizzas were excellent - far better than anticipated in an asian country : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Unfortunately after we unpacked we listened to a constant tapping overhead, which we were told would go on for another few days so we packed up & moved to a beautiful 1 bedroom suite on the 4th floor : []
i think the sellers half expect it so always quote you a price double what they expect, knowing you will haggle some money off : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Only down side - is that there is no WIFI in all the rooms yet : [u'amenities', u'internet']
I asked to speak to the Hotel Manager and he promply came to speak to me, he was very kind and moved me to another beautiful room but sadly he did not follow up the rest of the time with me to see how things had been going and I had further trouble in the new room and it took several hours to make it understood that the alarm clock was set to 5am and kept waking me up and I could not turn it off : []
There was a huge tv with lots of channels and choice : []
The Christmas evening dinner was again worh to book : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
The food at all restaurants is not high quality, beef is frozen! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The rooms are good and clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The massages were wonderful:) : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Great rooms, good internet : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But you are a short taxi ride from all the main destinations for food and drink : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Location: Having never been to Bali or any Asian resort area before, Nusa Dua was a great place to start off : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The buffet breakfast, was just average : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The management and staff combined to make our Special day one we will never forget-Great Time : []
Far from the Centeral Bali which is Kuta but a nice Hotel Resort on the Beach and amazing Getaway : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I wouldn't reccommend this hotel at all and was very glad to leave it!!! : []
The resort is five star and has great pools private beach with lay chairs big foyer freindly staff free breakfast great variety and security front and rear : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The hotel provided transport from the airport, the most comfortable vehicle ever, the driver was great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
But do please recheck the cribs provided when you're bringing your baby : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was OK : []
I would highly recommend having your wedding at this hotel : []
The hotel followed up with a phone call to see whether a doctor was needed, and also sent us a bouquet of flowers! There are free activities around the hotel every morning, kids are well catered for with kids club and movie nights etc, and the beach is safe to swim as there is an outer reef with (at tide turn) spectacular breakers : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Food and beverage prices at the high end cmpared to restaurants outside the resort, however, still more affordable than anything back home in similar hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The morning buffet breakfast has lots of food variety and the beach/pool were very inviting : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I'm so happy that we chose this Resort as part of our Honey Moon : []
from pizza to steak and from breakfast to dinner : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Genuinely friendly staff; impeccable facilities with a touch of luxury (not OTT) : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
It has a separate beach and a large swimming pool : []
A very big thank you to all the friendly staff, especially on the one day when I was not feeling too well and was sent flowers and had follow ups the following day to check on me : []
- Front desk quoted us a charge to make an outbound call to our local private Bali driver; our other hotels happily called for us for free : []
Great for walks along the foot way at the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
I don't know of any aircon that will get rid off the humidty if the doors are open : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
The rooms are extremely clean and comfortable, in this super hot and humid environment the air conditioning in the room worked great : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
breakfast food was not great, very average : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Kids need physical activities : [u'overall', u'culture']
I found that the staff were overall not as friendly as the hotel I had stayed in prior to staying at Nusa Dua Beach hotel : []
Everything is as advertised, except that it all looks very tired and need refreshing : []
If you book into this hotel make sure that the staff is informed if something is not as you requested and it will be quickly sorted out : []
From the moment I contacted the hotel and booked our wedding and honeymoon ( all done via email) the staff could not have been more helpful , friendly, prompt and professional : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I swam in their Lap pool (i was silly enough to put my head under water) and i ended up with ear and eye infections (bad) : []
The food was excellent and we felt that we got great value for money : []
Stayed 8 nights this year and have always enjoyed the hotel's traditional and friendly atmosphere : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
While resting around the pool areas, beach or restaurants at the hotel, unknown strangers and outsiders would approach us and try to sell trips and package tours to us as if we were staying in public beach : []
Need lots of candles to make it romantic : []
I loved the Cocktails and went to happy hour most nights at the bar, great time with the entertainment and met a lot of lovely people and a lot of Aussies : []
Thank you to all the staff who made our holiday wonderful : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
bathroom and terrace) and the inability to swim in the ocean : [u'location', u'sea']
We also had a massage in a hut looking out at the ocean which was bliss : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The food and drinks are fantastic we had so many options for our breakfast and dinner buffet : []
Left early because of it Bali past it prime now a SMOKERS den : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
All in all, we would not stay here again simply because of the location and the price of food/beverage : []
we also went outside the main gates and dinner there one night but we didnt really enjoy it as the food was a bit crap! we then tended to eat at the hotel as we loved the food and service was impeccible : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
One point that the hotel can improve on is perhaps the breakfast menu : [u'location', u'sea']
Great swimming pools and a private beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Nice food too : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
My husband and I loved our stay with you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hotel staff friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall a great stay in the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
On arriving in our room we were disgusted to find a filthy floor, used sanitary items on the bathroom floor and a room covered in dust and finger marks : []
They were able to advise on local restaurants, outside the hotel and made reservations for us : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Otherwise we highly recommend this resort and will visit again : [u'amenities', u'pool']
10 minutes to kuta by taxi where all the bars and restaurants are : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
We stayed at this hotel in the middle of January 2008 : []
Was not disappointed at all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We adored this resort and after our experience, wouldn't consider going anywhere else : []
For example when I told them that i needed to leave very early in the morning to head to the airport they were concerned that I would miss my breakfast and insisted on making up a breakfast box for us to take with us : []
No wifi available way from the lobby area : [u'location', u'general']
The gardens are exceptional, and the spa pool a hidden gem : [u'amenities', u'garden']
There is only wi-fi available in the lobby area and most of the time it didn't work properly which was definitely not what we expected from such a high-class hotel : []
But it is too big and commercialized to feel fully relaxed : []
The themed dinner buffets were about average at around 250,000 rupiah ++( $25 AUD)& I would give them a miss : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We stayed in a Deluxe room on the third floor for a period of 3 days during our visit : []
Eka our wedding planner contact at the hotel was fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
All the staff were very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The beach was very clean, long and sandy and a nice place to relax in the daytime : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We have already booked a second stay at the resort, and have recommended it to our friends and family : []
The best thing about the hotel was kids club where the staff organised great activities like kite-making and flying : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It can get very busy by the two big pools at the front of the resort : []
We had an extra bed brought up promptly but it made the room way too small : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resturaunts all had excellent food, although none of them understood that norwegians likes their coffee served WITH their desserts, not after! ;-) : [u'food-beverages', u'meal', u'drinks']
It's becoming an average experience with their new GM this 2013 : []
Departed on 31 : []
We spent 15 nights at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, and can recommend the hotel and facilities to anyone looking for a spotlessly clean hotel with extremely helpful staff : []
We deiced to eat in both nights and the food and service was excellent - although not cheap, prices were comparable with what you'd pay back in Australia : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I asked her if she would go back next time in Bali and she said 'definitely' : [u'overall', u'culture']
Took 3 hours to get to airport (normally a 30-40 minute taxi ride) due to holiday traffic : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
I only stayed in Nusa Dua Beach & Spa Hotel while i was visiting Bali : []
The beach was a very nice surprise, clean lagoon and very spacious white sandy beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We are in our 60's and bought a Luxury Escape deal never expecting such a wonderful holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We really love this hotel! : []
Hope this helps! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
had to get the front office to open the door : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
The hotel has 2 pools, a main pool and a lagoon pool which are both lovely : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Our greatest issue was probably the cost of actually being at the resort : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We stayed in Nusa Dua for 6 nights we travelled from Ubud and this was the final stay in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But very very quiet rooms : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
Only good memories : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My husband and I picked this hotel for our honeymoon stay because it seemed beautiful and secluded : []
When you book, it is definately worth while upgrading to palace club : []
No free wifi is always an issue for me : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Be nice if all the breakfast was hot : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We hired the hotel cars for the transfers to and from the airport : []
They aren't really 4 : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
we were truly spoilt!!!!!! Customer service second to none! All Club Palace privlidges including private breakfast, afternoon tea, evening cocktails : []
Their excuse is that they only have a limited voucher : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The reason why I would give it four stars instead of five is that this is a large commercial hotel and with that it loses some of the authentic charm that Bali has : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The Hotel premises are impressive and extremely well maintained, our room was really nice, clean, no musty Bali smell, fantastic beds and well laid out etc : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Absolutely love this resort and everything about it : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Great food (although a little over priced) : [u'location', u'sea']
We were there for the first time in 2004 and had a good experience then but weren't sure if we would go back : []
The second minus - this is a hotel, even the resort consisting of 90% of Russians - which sometimes gets very tiring : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Somebody told me that it is due to that we don't look "Caucasian" : []
people in charge, managers etc were keen to check that everything was going well for us : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great value, location and service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The new national golf course is awesome but expensive : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They give free of charge extra bed for child under 12 yrs : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
But I noticed none of them would rest by The Westin hotel because that part of beach does not have any trees! : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The beach front is very calm which means you do find a lot of weeds in the water : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel located in such a beautiful surrounding, but unfortunately we were having few problems regarding the service : []
It is really not good at all my kids saw it and didn't want to go at all : [u'overall', u'culture']
They did not charge us for the pool view room which was fair however it took many phone calls to get to this point as they did not understand that, to us, it was not an upgrade and we were not paying for something we did not get : []
Beer and coktail prices by the pool were not to bad : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
Staff are exceptionally friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
30 am and drink my mango juce and watsch the sun coming up : []
The people, food, service were all great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This was all table service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Spent some time in Kuta : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
All of them were perfect for different things : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There are plenty of sun lounges around and ample shade : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Thank you so much! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My only 'complaint' if any is the communication barrier with concierge and reception staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
After much research, courtesy of Tripadvisor, we decided on the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for our 8 night Bali getaway : []
Also, be prepared to have to travel a fair bit for meals if you're not very keen on consuming the hotel's food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The room was nice with the wood carving, creating an Indonesian touch to the room : [u'room', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics']
But this is a matter of individual choice and your preferences : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast food variety is limited however omelette is cooked to perfection (The chef who was there all the time was impressive) : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The resort is rustic in line with Balinese culture : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We will definately be going back, due mostly to the wonderful treatment of all their guests : []
The renovations were also very disruptive and woke me up most mornings and I could not sit out on the balcony without hearing the noise : []
Along with massages available for a relaxing time in the sun : [u'location', u'sea']
Other amenities in the hotel include a money changer, tour organiser and a small variety of shops : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We stayed here for a week in September and had such a relaxing time, preferring this time to stay in a quieter area : []
We had stayed in Sanur before staying in Nusa Dua and found the level of English spoken here was much lower and at times another staff member had to assist : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel in September, where we had arranged to get married : []
Spend some time exploring the hotel ground, it is lovely! Love the pond area in Palace Club : []
The temperatur of air condition is not adjustable : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
The pools were well maintained and never seemed overcrowded : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
- The Nusa Dua area is staylish and safe, Bali collection center and sogo shoping mall are very closed to the hotel with lots of good resturants ( balinees, western, seafood, : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The private beach is really clean and peaceful, the pool very relaxing, the breakfast spread is too good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The room, staff, pool and beach were all exactly as we had hoped and for a honeymoon couple who didn't want the stress of haggling and travelling about it was perfect : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
With our package came 12 spa treatments and the spa is lovely the pool down in the spa is quiet and peaceful if you want to get away from the children in the main pool : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Checking in at the Palace Club reception was relaxing, effortless and civilised : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
The cultural shows were a bonus and there is lots to see in BALI : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On the first night our air con was a bit warm so I reported it to the duty Manager and he moved all of us to 2 new rooms with very cold air con : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
They have an interesting program of activities which changes daily : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Nusa Dua is a safe area and peaceful : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The man working in the gym was very friendly : [u'overall', u'culture']
During our stay we were able to experience the ups and downs of the hotel : []
We stayed in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our anniversary : []
The entrance area is open and welcoming leading to well attended gardens housing a few different style pool areas, restaurants, with quiet areas to repose in leading to the beach itself : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I love very much the beach with sun chair and swimming pool : []
It is peaceful, beautiful and it makes you feel serene : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
(well it may as well be) The room is old and the airconditioining barely works : []
We decided on the hotel after reading the reviews on here and finding a good deal online : []
Don't miss the high tea hour where they serve tea/coffee/juices and a whole platter of sweets and savory for free!(plus you can ask for more!) And at night come down and drink some cocktails in cocktail hour, serving a range of alcohol/non-alcohol drinks and some small bites(everyday the small bites change) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Overall the total experience of this older property is still good although not as glitzy as some of the newer neighbouring properties : [u'overall', u'feel']
The other cluster of hotels were definitely more updated--ie: the laguna has nicer beach beds and looked fancier : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We gave only been home for a few hours and we already have family planning to book this hotel for a holiday next year : []
had a 3 course meal for 99,000 rupia which is AUD10 : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The beach and pools are great with many sunbeds available : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Another con we found in the shopping centre is being approached by sellers telling you about a new hotel (the best in Bali apparently ;) ) that they are advertising : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
You get soft drinks and tea and coffee 24 hours in the Palace club and free wireless internet : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I feel there could have been a greater variation in food choice as we ate at the hotel all the time : []
Also the deck chairs at the beach should have abit of shade (umbrellas/cabanas/etc) like the neighboring resorts just so your guest can enjoy the beach at high noon without getting burnt : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast is FAULTLESS : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
For my taste it is too isolated and expensive area; you will not get to know Bali there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool area was lovely and also the Theme dinners : [u'location', u'general']
Frogs are everywhere and we had fun frog hunting : []
We relaxed so much while here, you would not know that there was another busy bustling side to Bali : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The hotel is situated on a good stretch of beach which is kept spotlessly clean : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We paid around USD$130 per night which is not expensive at all by international standards for a resort of this quality : [u'amenities', u'conference']
- insane room rate ( an extra 199 usd/night) for upgrading to a room closer to the pool with exactly the same standard, but a few squaremeters of more space : [u'overall', u'spacious']
And I'm sure if I had the chance to properly complain to the staff, they would have been able to accomodate it very properly : []
Breakfast food was fresh and tasty, lots of choices and continually refilled, tables cleared promptly and assisted seating during busy times so no wandering about looking for a table : [u'location', u'sea']
Otherwise I would highly recommend staying at NDBH : []
To be frank, this does not seem worthy of it's Leading Hotel status; it's some boast to be voted Best Hotel in Asia in 1997 and I think the reputation has diminished somewhat : [u'overall', u'culture']
Really enjoyed the omeletes and fresh tropical juices : []
But it made us stay at the hotel more and discover every facilities it has : []
Overall, total satisfaction : [u'location', u'sea']
Staff are very kind, friendly and engaging : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
hospital for an emergency operation : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Best pork sausages in the region : [u'location', u'general']
We had come from Singapore and the hotel there had left us a lovely card and bowl of fruit to acknowledge our Honeymoon but there in Nusa Dua which was a wee bit disappointing : [u'amenities', u'conference']
My husband and I still talk about the breakfasts there, they were sooo delicious and probably the best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel : []
It was peaceful and relaxing and great value : []
Overall a great stay- but just some room to improve upon would be - the rather old sunbeds compared to nearby resorts and clearing of floating seaweeds and washed up trash near the pier (which seems to be a common issue in the area) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
My two girls (aged 4 & 7) got entertained at "Gecko's Kids Club" almost every day as they did all sorts of fun activities (puppet making, baking, & bali costume dress up to name but a few) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Great rooms, great service from the workers and great restraunts : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The hotel staff was very pleasant and always very eager to please : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The pools are clean and refreshing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We loved our stay and the kids thought they were in heaven : [u'location', u'sea']
The staff was very very very friendly, as if we are the king : []
We have the hotel tour counter pick is up from the airport : [u'location', u'airport']
we did use the lap pool by the spa as it was really quiet there and relaxing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
My spa appointment was booked on the 1st day when I arrived : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Around the pools and wet areas are VERY slippery and we saw quite a few people go over so you have to tread very cautiously : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The on site clinic facility came in handy when my daughter developed a runny nose and high fever : [u'overall', u'culture']
We actually recommend this place and do not miss the SPA, is something difficult to find elsewhere! We will never forget this place : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The excellent variety of food was of good quality and and plentiful, and the surroundings were the most luxurious we have ever experienced : []
It was quite and clean : []
From arrival to departure we were both blown away by the resorts beauty, exceptional service, facilities and serenity : []
Very good service and the friendly Bali smile from all staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
but walking in the water on the other side of the world is nothing to complain about ever! : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'general']
For comparison, 2 days later in melia's pool was 29 : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The spa was very nice, I treated myself to a massage and had a nice peaceful swim in the spa pool : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We definitely will be back to stay again : []
It certainly wasn't something to get upset about : []
White concrete, White tiles, White sunbeds with White towels : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens', u'bathrobe', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
Got the premier room, not as big as seen on pictures, though still comfortable and get a good night sleeps : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
In conclusion this hotel has all the necessary components to provide a peaceful and tranquil escape from the everyday stresses and strains we all endure! : []
I stayed here after getting married at St : []
The pools are very nice too : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I had a stressful encounter at the domestic airport which they were happy to help resolve for me once back at the lounge : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The free lobby internet at the hotel proved to be acceptable : [u'amenities', u'internet']
I would not recommend this hotel to younger people (25-30yrs) : []
We stayed in a Garden View room with very close access to the beach and pool : []
Nice relaxing stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
whole family was in love with the resort and we did not want to leave : []
What a great guy !!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel had some of the nicest grounds of any hotel I have seen : []
I was lucky to stay at this great resort in March and it is probably my favourite in the Nusa Dua area : []
Room was great : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Wonder why this place belongs to 'The Leading Hotels of The World' : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Free wifi at the hotel lobby : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
So many squirrels at the garden : [u'amenities', u'garden']
They have this amazing shack type beds on the beaches from where you can enjoy the spectacular sea view for endless hours : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had breakfast every morning and sitting by the small pond was very pleasant, there is a great selection and also items like poached egg can be ordered if you like : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Having waited so long to get away from all the stresses of work and such like, i can honestly say this is the first holiday where i felt i could have stayed for at least another week : []
The afternoon tea and evening cocktails were an added bonus as was the free Balineese massage and a cultural evening, which turning out to be an incredible sea-food BBQ : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We would stay here again & would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Bali, seeking a tropical escape : []
Still furious, I spoke to someone else who upgraded us to the palace suite with free wifi and a stand alone shower which was better for my mum : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel is built to capture the feeling of Bali and certainly lives up to that : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Why did we ever wait this long : []
Always transport at hand if you need : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We opted for the premium deal but not the Palace Club upgrade and were not disappointed at all : []
The rooms were nice and clean, but I kind of expected more : []
If you want shopping, Bali collection offers a wide variety of shops and restaurants at reasonable prices : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
so no issues with asking for anything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I love the setting of restaurant serving breakfast surrounded by pond full of lotus flowers : []
The only negative comments are for the rude, embarrassing Australians who find it acceptable to be rude to the staff who cannot do enough to please you : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The only problem was the size of the bathroom : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Having said that, a top tip is to go and find the Lap Pool over next to the Spa, which was almost empty compared to the main pool : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Very clean and well equipped : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
there were 2 huge chairs to sit in the balcony and enjoy the view : [u'room-experience', u'view']
The resort exceeded our expectations : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & spa from 15th to 21st September for our silver wedding anniversary : []
Which is what we wanted but we have since moved on to Sanur where you can go for a walk and see : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is quite disappointed since we book this hotel because it seems to be very relaxing and resort like : []
The package also included a free photograph and we have a lovely reminder of our wonderful holiday : []
I stayed here with my family & found to my delight that The hotel service was exceptional & staff very polite : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We liked the variety of pleasant music on offer, and were thankful it was not a nightclub scene : []
This trip i managed to visit nusa dua with my family : []
I fell in love the place at the moment I saw it, so did my son : []
julie and garry perth : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
I was disappointed that we were not given the room I had booked when we first arrived we had 2 single beds pushed together : []
It is safe and staff are always available and ready to help : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Beautiful surrounds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a wonderful time in Bali : []
I had a facial - this was so relaxing and what i like is the staff do not talk while treating you and the birds singing in the trees along with the soothing balinese music in the back ground : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
staff is always smiling & rather too courtaeous : []
Really luxury and beautiful hotel with high level of services (cleaning room twice a day, huge selection of breakfast, modern fitness centrum, nice spa area and pools) : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The way we were treated was out of this world, the most caring, attentive people you could ask for : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed in primier room from 9 Dec to 12 Dec, All their room have garden view, they have beach but no wave : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Food was yummy with lots of choices : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Breakfast was held in the Palace lounge but didn't quite offer the same as the general breakfast dining room : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The only complaint however, was that the rooms are showing signs of aging, particularly the bathroom area : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
No complaints otherwise and would highly recommend a stay here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There were plenty of shops outside the hotel to buy drinks and other items from : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Overall, my wife and I will be back to the Resort and include the family all together in the same place : [u'overall', u'culture']
It was very good in other areas : []
Although it is also controlled by a switch in the room : []
Kuta and Legion are the same, a rat race : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Great pools! The staff were super friendly always stopped to say good morning or hello without hesitation : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is also worth noting that we went during low season (in early December), so resort was even more quiet, and that made our getaway even more enjoyable : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'others']
We stayed in the Royal Palace Suite which was beautiful : [u'amenities', u'conference']
probably not worth it : []
The spa pool is a refuge : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
My husband and I spent nearly 4months hunting every nook and corner of Tripadvisor for a Best Pick of the Resort fit for Honeymoon at Bali ! Must say, the efforts were worth it : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
This time i brought my snorkle with me so i could explore the shallow beach during Low-tide (around 10AM-12PM or 4-5PM) : []
Counted 16 staff members while our drinks sat on the counter for over 5 minutes only to walk over and pick them up ourselves : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Also, check for monthly specials at the hotel's restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Made to feel very welcome : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, if I was to saty in Bali again I would stay at this resort : []
There are many option for Restaurant with variety of menu : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Rooms a big, beds are very comfortable, separate bath and shower : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Our Honeymoon both from Leamington Spa, England : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Most parts of the hotel are stylish and attractive : [u'location', u'general']
hotel has arranged cake and flowers in my room on my birthday tooo : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Even al a carte restaurants were very reasonably priced with great food and great and friendly Balinese service : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
I have mixed feelings about the Nusa Dua, while the location is good, all the beach hotels in Nusa Dua have a great location, so it isn't anything special to write home about : []
extremely expensive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel atmosphere was excellent : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
I suppose this hotel is the oldest 5 star Hotel in Bali, but they can maintain the condition very well : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
You have a well managed hotel in a great setting : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel staff were also very friendly, greeting us wherever we went : []
It is worth the money you pay for in this place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A very dedicated professional : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
It's worth every cent! We were pampered from the moment we arrived until our reluctant departure : []
Staff/people very friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua beach resort and spa is the place to be,brilliant gardens and pools, rooms give a real Bali experience and plenty of high class food options : [u'amenities', u'garden']
we also tried the Spa : []
This was very disappointing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beautiful grounds, pool, beach and great buffet breakfast too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One tip I do have is when you are leaving the Bali Collection, always walk a little bit up the street and catch a light blue Taxi instead of the Taxis Bali Collection arrange for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup', u'post-room', u'checkout']
We booked a premier room, located on 1st floor : []
Lovely gardens everywhere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I could meet the young french Spa Manageress Aurore just to congratulate her for the quality and attentions to details : []
Very nice Hotel, in a secured area with all facility there : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The buffet breakfast is top notch and the beach restaurants for lunch or dinner were casual with delicious meals : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Pretty average and it's well : [u'location', u'sea']
Facilities in hotel are great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
An avgerage drink at this resort will cost you 9-10 u : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
Unfortunately it isn't really a 5 star hotel, maybe once but not now and the food is way behind other hotels in Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Our 5th stay at Nudsa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa in the last 15 years : [u'location', u'sea']
We just stayed Overnight, felt very welcome : []
Still a beautiful hotel - right mix of gardens, Balinese temple architectural and facilities : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Overall I will def : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Certainly a resort to visit in Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The restaurants at the resort were quite expensive but there are free shuttles to Bali Collection shopping complex that depart and return on the hour : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff are so warm and polite in the palace club : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I had the pleasure of meeting the new General Manager who spent time with guests : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I would say this hotel is worth staying and it will give you absolute value for money : []
The only thing I could fault it for was that there was no free wifi in the bedroom, but it was free from any other part of the hotel including the pool and beach area : []
00 AUS if you don't want to wait for the next shuttle : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only complaint we had about the room was that the television was not flat screen and had bad reception : [u'room', u'appliances']
Will definitely recommend this hotel to others, if they prefer to stay at Nusa Dua area! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The beach was beautiful, the only downside was so much seaweed! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
When we dined at the restaurants we found that the service was not up to expectation, waiting for service and bills at the end of the meals for long periods : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Finally the complimentary water on the rooms was not mineral, was refilled! no date of issue and expiration! : [u'amenities', u'pool']
One check point through general tourist area and another Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa check point : [u'location', u'sea']
Also loved the spa area, went everyday and it was never too busy : []
Poor service, left me sitting in the Lobby waiting with no advice how my room was going : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
kids and close proximity to pool won us over! The man who serviced our room daily was a champion, as were all the staff : [u'overall', u'culture']
large swimming pool and four restaurants within resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
It was comfortable although not as large as the one we had the first time and had room to sit and talk as well as a refrigerator : []
The staff are helpful and friendly and were able to assist in whatever we asked for : []
but avoid the beach, it is not safe for kids : []
I stayed at the property for 4 nights in November 2012 : []
Heaven on a stick (and you can get some really good clothes etc on the beach from some of the very few vendors allowed there!! - very well controlled) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Thank you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food and cocktails are of top quality : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The gigantic and wonderful breakfast spread bailed me out : []
The food options were more than acceptable and the beach access is the best we have experienced in Bali : []
If were to return to Bali we would stay at this resort again and hopefully see our only complaints resolved : []
Would love to go back but we always try to go somewhere new and it is quite a long journey from the UK but would definitely reccomend it if you are on your way back from NZ or Australia : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room , hotel facilities , breakfast and service is good but I hope more children activity can do here : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Jacuzzi and hot pool were a welcome addition after using the steam and sauna to jump into (well use the steps and its deep) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Definetly be back to stay : []
My friend and I spent 5 nights at your resort and just flew home on October 3, 2014 : [u'location', u'sea']
Check in took us over one hour, we found the reception staff had a problem understanding us with our reguest : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I couldn't fault anything and wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else for a return trip! : []
There were twin washbasins and top-class toiletries : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
There's a lovely paved walk along the beachfront which heads off in both directions and is very quiet for an early morning run - I went out at about 7 : []
- transfer should've also been included in a high class hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I had a feeling that the rooms had been renovated : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The Hotel is right on the beach with a plethora of bars and restaurants to pick from and a short walk into Nusa Dua town, with small markets other places to keep busy : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The spa treatments were out of this world! All three theme dinners were unbelievable : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
We were very close to the pool and main eating area which was great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Again, we were bowled over by how charming, efficient and friendly the staff were : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Club room has more space and has direct access to club area beautiful garden : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The breakfast was great, and the staff were very friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
My advice to anyone staying in The Nusa Dua would to try and get a room above the ground floor : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Great service, good breakfast, and the room was spacious : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The bathroom was clogged, water everywhere : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Wonderful atmosphere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa about 13 years ago when my oldest son was around 7/8 yrs old and loved it : [u'overall', u'culture']
Since they have a large property area, you wont get enough strolling around this hotel, so many activities, biking, Balinese dancer, diving lesson, fruit carving etc, you can hop pool to pool to experience swimming quality with your friends n family : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great hotel, service, attentiveness from the staff, cleanliness, good variety of activities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I had booked premier room with breakfast & airport pickup : []
ideal to brake away from a too busy job : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We chose Nusa Dua Beach Hotel because we saw a lot of good comments about it and we thought we would love to try : []
We were just too tired to request a different room after 24 hours of travelling : []
Overall, we had a great experience staying in the hotel : []
Not sure if the hotel had notified Expedia of this but someone should have let us know that we wouldn't be getting what we booked : []
Highly recommended though in house costs are a little expensive if you are not in the Palace Club rooms - you simply must upgrade as it is great value!! : []
There isn't much else in the area : [u'location', u'general']
My first trip to Bali with my son his wife and my grandson,I was pleasantly surprised Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa was just wonderful from breakfasts daily to the many theme nights and beautiful food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
You can walk along the beach in the evening to see what the other hotels are serving for dinner if you want a change or instead of going to Bali Collection : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We also really enjoyed the traditional Balinese dances in the outdoor theatre : []
They also had one of those 'half' shower screens so water went everywhere : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The only issue for our stay were the sun loungers at the pool area : [u'amenities', u'conference']
My only 'need' was some more affordable laundry options as travelling with 3 children (4, 6 & 8 yo) : [u'overall', u'culture']
Magnificent resort with all that one could ask for, beautiful location with warm, friendly and helpful personnel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Gorgeous pools and lovely room with balcony and views of ocean : [u'location', u'sea']
We didn't eat in the resort but ate at Bali Collection which is about a 15min walk or a free shuttle bus away : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Stay at the hotel and enjoy all the facilities and discover the spa which features wonderful treatments, it has a lap pool, female and male heated jacuzzis, gym which is a little oasis tucked away from the main hotel area or just enjoy the main pool and pool bar for happy hour each day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A most relaxing and enjoyable week : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Bali Collection is also within walking distance of the hotel ,although free transport is provided there too : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We want to thank all the people who made our stay almost perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Me and my wife would like to thank Nusa dua beach hotel for a pleasant stay : []
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel : []
We stayed 10 days and every day was a delight : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The rooms are spacious, the staff are wonderful, the breakfast is great and the lagoon pool is ideal for people travelling with children : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The room we had was very spacious and comfortable and not too far from the pools : []
After a not-so-warm welcome from Customs at the airport, we were a bit anxious and not sure what to expect from the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Furniture and bathroom a bit dated (but not "bad") and rear-projection TV took up space - but all clean, and very acceptable : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'conference']
I have a great tailor who made me a gorgeous long leather skirt and biker jacket : []
Location: Well we thought it would only be around 30 minutes by taxi to go to Seminyak or Kuta but boy were we wrong : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
a gated subdivision comprising of huge resort complexes : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We booked this hotel through a Luxury Escapes voucher which had loads of great inclusions : [u'amenities', u'conference']
There are three types of rooms : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
An overall nice clean hotel : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
This breakfast leaves a similar type we had in the Flamingo Hilton Las Vegas : []
Other than that the rooms were not dis-similar that others and unfortunately were away from the beach and sea breezes : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
As soon we entered the property to check-in the first few words were "wow" :) : []
When looking for a hotel that could combine a honeymoon with relaxation, cuisine and location, there could not have been a better hotel than Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So many pool areas to choose from and never felt crowded (the spa pool area extremely peaceful with great amenities) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Great variety of food choices : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Staff were really friendly and very attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
away from the rat race of Kuta but still easy and cheap to get into Kuta in about 20 - 30 minutes along new toll road : [u'amenities', u'garden']
this resort has fantastic packages on Cudo : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Our room was fine but there could have been some improvements- ie the bathroom was tiny with no shower screen so the whole place would get wet! We also were given a family room, which was great for the extra space but kind of felt like it was a bit of poor planning, a bit pointless having an extra single bed in an adjoining room : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
An incredibly generous package : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I'm going to start with the greats about this trip as there are many : []
Staff were fantastic and so friendly they would do anything for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Was a great great holiday, Love bali so much : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We had been there with our kids, enjoy every moment in the area, clean pool, clean beach, beautiful Bali atmosphere, quiet and relaxing, but this time we traveled as a couple : []
Online booking was simple, quick and very easy to use : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There is no free or paid wifi in the rooms : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Good hotel but eating and drinking in the hotel is very expensive for a country like Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We were made to feel relaxed and happy at all times : []
Having stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa this time was great : [u'location', u'sea']
Very modern but still with a traditional Indonesian feel! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast is the usual asian buffet which was nice and fresh and changed alternate days : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The service we received during these celebrations was second to none : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The leaisure facilities were also excellent with several beautiful pools (although they closed very early 7 pm for water treatment which could be done later especially considering it was such a great time to go for a swim) : []
com so I'm ok with it in the end : [u'location', u'sea']
That's just wasteful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Special mention must be made of the staff -- they are just fantastic -- cant do enough for you-- we have found a new bechmark in exceptional costomer service! : []
The breakfasts were great everything you could ever want and the theme nights gave you a taste of Balinese culture : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Negatives; despite an email to confirm our airport pick up, no one arrived : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My mums standard room was even bigger than ours, but not so decorative : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had taken an ocean view room which was a bit small but the balcony helped : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
When we arrived to our rooms, we were very impressed until my husband & I laid on our bed : [u'overall', u'culture']
My husband and I stayed at this hotel in one of the palace club suites because of a friend's recommendation and we loved it! What an amazing deal because you get a spectacular breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails in the palace club : []
Waking up the 1st day, opening the doors, greeted with the garden view : [u'room-experience', u'view']
The staff are so wonderful, friendly and obliging : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Before our kids came along we stayed in a Palace Club room and for the last 5x years have booked a suite : [u'location', u'sea']
Very good spa,tennis,squash and a small fitness : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
very bad - pool closes at 7 pm : []
A quiet, peaceful resort that has you whispering on occasions, the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is the perfect place in Bali to relax : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Spa was great! Package was ideal for us : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
the rooms are also much bigger and are situated at the most beautiful pond with ducks swimming around (in the morning they come up to the palace club to demand breakfast each day around 10 o clock, it is so cute! : []
The restaurants and spa treatments are extremely expensive when compared to the outside the resort : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
but they should include the taxes and service fees in the prices in advance : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Afterall it was a good experience but I believe it could be better : []
It also looks a bit tired and needs renovating : []
The whole Nusa Dua area is superb! : [u'location', u'general']
I had a very good relaxing time here, the breakfast was over my expectation, the yoga at the sunrise, the weddings in the yards, the pools the beach views, the theatre with shows for the dinner, the rooms, everything great! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Pools: The hotel has 2 pools- main & lagoon : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Been to Bali many times and have never left a hotel thinking NEVER again : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
1) A bit gloomy especially with few Balinese carvings in the room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be returning : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would I return to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel? Not unless it is a last resort as there are so many other neighbouring 5 star resorts which are definitely worth trying : []
We stayed in a club suite room which was a little more spacious as we were travelling with an 18 month old : []
The beach shelves down steeply and goes out about half a mile at low tide they say you need to be careful of sea urchins! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The selection at the other two dinners was also disappointing : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
It also left a bad taste for us, since it was my parents first trip to Bali : []
It is very safe with lots of security and the hotel has their own private beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A real family favourite : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
3) Good service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Alcohol I also thought was pricey! Otherwise a lovely stay : []
Room was big and spacious, clean and very comfortable beds : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The grounds are beautiful and so well maintained - a true oasis : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room was interconnecting with two solid timber doors adjacent to our respective televisions : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Room smells good everytime we got back from our tour : []
Check-in was unprofessional and slow : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
The staff is old and some of them are rude and do not even greet the guests : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The service stood out in comparison to a lot of other places we have stayed : []
The Asian restaurant (Japanese/ Chinese) seemed very quiet : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
We just got back three days ago, spending four night there : []
Breakfast had a great variety and very tasty : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We stayed here during October : []
Will it be the Westin or Nusa Dua Beach Hotel? Great service and Kids Club VS excellent pool, surroundings, garden and culture : []
This is a lovely hotel with beautiful grounds and beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff behind the main counter just seemed interested in running a business and did not go above and beyond, like our previous hotel did : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The only negative was that food and drinks were expensive but then again it is a 5 star hotel : []
The spa is super nice : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Feeling totally rejuvenated after having a massage : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We ate in the hotel on several occasions and the food was all delicious and well presented allbeit very expensive; the lunchtime bbq was a favourite too : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It is really amazing : []
Your pool towels were also on the sun lounges waiting for you, unlike the main pool where you have to give them some sort of token for a towel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Gladly I stayed at the palace club room I could access to their palace club lounge and get unlimited drinks service at any time : []
The spa had its own pool which looked very inviting : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Wonderful staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Access to the Palace Club was a great bonus, afternoon tea, a la carte breakfast, cocktail evenings etc : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Value for money beautiful surroundings luxury & peace no one harassing you staff help you if you need something r have an enquiry you don't have to be rich to enjoy this just accept that you deserve a lovely place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The instructor I had hired got far too 'friendly' while sitting behind me on the jet ski : [u'location', u'mountains']
What a beautiful hotel! At the same time we were here, our daughter was staying at a #1 hotel in Legian : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Obviously we compared our stay with the Westin Nusa Dua and can say honestly, the service and Kids Club at the Westin is miles ahead : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Staff cant do enough for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Complementry massages were very good, thank you Prisma! Great family friendly hotel, very clean and felt safe : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
From the housekeeping staff to the Hotel wedding Planner, they were amazing : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However, our group loved the large resort as there are many pools, deck chairs and activities to indulge in - even table tennis : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
only thing which disappointed was the size of the pool : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
room No#1213 not that much good : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We stayed for 3 nights in a Palace Club Suite : []
I cant even imagine how much money it would cost these days to build such as a hotel as the details in the woodwork, carvings, floors etc : []
The guests should have been warned about the awful fumes in the hallway from varnish from the renovations to the pool view rooms - it was very bad and I really think the whole area should have been closed off and no one allowed to use the rooms around the renovations : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
You can stop along the way for refreshments at the other resorts which like the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, also have their own beach space : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It really was a great hotel and the Balinese people are so nice and friendly : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
through out our stay there we were well attended to : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Obviously more pricey than other parts of Bali but worth it for the space and service : [u'overall', u'spacious']
As usual, I went through the process of reading reviews, before booking this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Unfortunately I picked up a virus half way through our stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There was a huge selection at breakfast from fruit and juices to hot dishes and salads : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
Stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel recently with the Luxury Escapes Package : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Our friends who stayed next door at the Westin agreed that the Nusa Dua hotel has far more atmosphere and the most beautiful grounds : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I'm a Bali regular who was dissappointed : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Staff friendliness, food quality, location and hotel facilities were all excellent could not fault any aspect : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
This place, coutry is beautifull : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Next to this there was the walk-in shower with two different showers heads inside : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Great to be able to get food and drinks service on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
A safe enviroment for kids and adults with all the facilities that you would want in a place like Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Do go to the Balinese restaurant by the pool, it was amazing in every way : []
Superb facilities from the excellent range of breakfast to start the day to the lovely pools to the relaxing areas around the beach and the quality traditional evening entertainment : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
What did I enjoyed in the hotel? There room is great, pool is huge, spa area is nice (but I had no time to experience the services) beach front is clean and not crowded, people are nice : []
4 days and 3 nights were not enough for us to fill our hearts : []
Travelled with my Wife & 2 : [u'overall', u'culture']
It is quite exhausting to walk it at night time because of the humidity, but there is a complementary bus that goes about every half hour or so : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They gave us a room that was nice and had a good view but was on the farthest side from the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I was not advised by the kids club staff either before hand about the charge : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
- Drink was 30% more expensive than other Bali destinations : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
We were in a suite away from the pool which we loved as it was peaceful : []
sorry for this, but will not recommend! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We then went to the front desk to ask if these things could be addressed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room was cleaned at least twice a day : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Also I think it's a pitty that although housekeeping did a great job in cleaning the main parts of the rooms, they forgot to clean small corners : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There are two pools and we preferred to swim in the older pool which has a sand bottom and was very relaxing : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I had a wonderful time whilst staying at the Nusa Dua the staff were awesome and very helpful and nothing was to much trouble will be back for sure as I've all ready got plans for next September thank you Michael : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The well groomed gardens, the clean beach, spotless pools, not to mention the breakfast in the morning, what an excellent way to begin a day ! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff especially in the the Palace club really are amazing : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It was nice to have time relaxing on the beach and if this is all you want to do this is fine : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
To use in your room you had to pay for it but the reception was hopeless and kept dropping out : [u'amenities', u'banquet', u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
The area of the resort is very huge, which takes days to see each corners : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Out the main gates to Nusa Dua is a few good restaurants : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
I would have no problem recommending this hotel : []
But even though they don't have much, they seem to really figure out how to have everything! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Rooms were very clean & spacious with Balinese feel : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
This hotel also has its own crystal-clear private beach just few steps from the rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
This would be at the top of our list for best Hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pizza place was bad, we had to eat there one night because Chess restaurant was closed due to a beach party barbecue : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast buffet is awesome : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
First time in Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
the range of pools are great and the spa pool is not discovered by many until late in the stay : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The choices in the four restaurants were quite impressive and good quality food : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There is a free bus to the Bali Collection shops, but it is not quite what we expected : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had Palace rooms, and were upgraded to a suite, without asking : []
I had the curry, but asked for chicken instead of barramundi and OH MY LORD DELICIOUS : []
The palace club is defenitely wortth the money : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
In fact we ate the best at the hotel itselve (Sotto ayam and also the bami goreng is very nice at Chess) and also at Bumbu Bali (Satay was nice, also the gado gado and great Indonesian desserts) : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Would definitely stay here again! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Toiletries were replaced only on requesting for them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
In the palace club suite there is TV in both rooms, 2 bathrooms, a large balcony, walk in robe and a kitchenette : []
Rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I'd say the photos on the hotel web page made it look slightly larger than actually is, but not a criticism : []
To us this hotel is " Bali " and will now no longer stay anywhere else , we can't speak highly enough of this hotel , the staff , facilities and general feel of the hotel are great , we have been to Bali 7 times and stayed in Kuta , Legian and Seminak but staying in Nusa Dua( and this hotel ) is different kind of Bali experience : [u'overall', u'feel']
The fish and turtles are all so very healthy looking : [u'food-beverages', u'meal', u'amenities', u'pool']
Thoroughly enjoyed my time there : [u'location', u'sea']
Because this is in a walled community, it is a bit of a walk to the shops unless you avail yourself of the free shuttle buses to Bali Connection or if you go to a restaurant that provides pick-up : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
About the hotel: pros :checkin & checkout was supersmooth : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Second - Thank you, to the duty manager "Dika" who stayed with me for an hour to look after my children as I was completely unable to : []
There are two nice pools and the beach in front with lounges and plenty of shade trees is a great place to wind down and relax with a book : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Having said that, Nusa Dua has an excellent selection of eateries - traditional european and asian : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Widdy made us feel very welcome whilst been professional & efficient, we will keep fond memories of our daily visits : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'others']
The shows accompanying the dinners were also excellent and all in all well worth doing : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Some people may not like this : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The food was lovely and you will find a wide range of food served for breakfast to suit everyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Palace Club was definitely worth the additional money : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
On our most recent visit in April, my sister also came with her family : [u'overall', u'culture']
We had a great time at the hotel : []
Our "Luxury Escapes" package was everything we wanted it to be : []
Even the pork sausages and hams, for sure not an asian staple, were of best quality : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Our driver was called Made and his number is 087852534257 : [u'location', u'sea']
Sadly, both the Indonesian and the multi purpose Asian - Maguro - are a letdown : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
However should you fancy a night on the town then Kuta is the place to go $10 USD will get you there in a taxi (about 20 mins) and you can party on till the early hours : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were astonished at how good they were - taking requests from guests and playing every song : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I love the spaciousness, after all it is a pretty huge development : []
We love free facilities of sauna & jacuzzi also yoga & ice / fruit demo : []
The staff is so polite and courteous : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The Breakfast is served in perfect settings : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I can't speak highly enough for them : []
We would love to go back one day : []
Although 30 years old, we were made to feel very much at home : []
OK, but asked if they can help, said they advised Cleaning to prepare room : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful with everything we needed : []
We did travel with a 2 year old and there were rarely kids in the kids club : [u'overall', u'culture']
We are not sure which hotel some other reviewers have stayed in as we don't recognise the hotel they described : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Just beautiful to stroll through the complex : [u'location', u'general']
So sad that we have to wait until next May! Hope they can accommodate us in a Palace Suite! : []
The entire staff is there to make sure your stay is everything you hoped it would be and more : []
The hotel then left flowers and a get well card in our room which was a lovely touch! The only negative of the hotel are the prices of the food and drinks are a little expensive, however you are paying for a 5 star luxury resort which offers you a very safe, clean and relaxing experience : [u'amenities', u'conference']
expensive hotel food ! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel is very,very big : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
nice hotel, nice room, nice beach and not to forget nice kids club for my daughter : [u'overall', u'culture']
Overwhelming in all respects : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And hide away when you need some down time : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the rooms in palace club were loveley and the palace club blimey you could get away with not spending a penny if you wanted there is so much food !! : []
It was a clean hotel pool area, reasturants,and beach : []
I was able to do all the above throughout my entire trip and stay at Nusa : []
and the walls in the toilet I thought could do with a scrub : []
It is still 30-45mins to Kuta/Seminyak so for those who want to be in the centre of town, this may not be suitable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Any negative points? Only a minor one : [u'location', u'sea']
While I know for certain the Balinese people get paid very low wages paying $16 for a cocktail, the same as I would in Australia where staff are paid a decent amount for service, its hard to swallow the concept that at full western prices the staff are still on such low wages : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
don't assume you will get a sea view : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we booked into the club rooms and we were not disappointed : []
Family friendly hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One memory of the hotel that I really enjoy is us watching the squirrels in the early morning and afternoon, they were great! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The grounds are pretty and clean : [u'overall', u'safety']
A complete seafood meal for two, including lobsters, big shrimps, crab, fish, etc : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Fabulous Hotel in a wonderful setting : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Depends what you are looking for I suppose : []
Staff are excellent and you can see the investment in training : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would come back perhaps if we got same sharp rate next time : []
The pool area did get quite busy but we always found sun loungers (tip, go down before breakfast and reserve your loungers with the towels supplied - they will still be there as long as you return within a couple of hours) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
After spending 4 nights in the wonderful mandarin oriental Hong Kong this hotel was very disappointing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We were amazed at how many rooms there were : []
We have no hesitation in recommending this lovely hotel, made better by the attentive and courteous staff : []
Avoid hotel recommended Taxi much cheaper outside,can hire pick up taxi for rest of stay privately : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Very thoughtful staff that was also very obliging with children : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Never felt crowded and the other guests were all very respectful and quiet : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Had a wonderful room with a big balcony on the 4th floor overlooking a beautiful garden : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The beach is sad, especially when the tide is out, again, a pity the Balinese don't feel moved to treat their environment more protectively, unfortunately too much litter : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Restaurants were great and we had a wonderfull stay : []
All of them are of a bery high standard but I really fell in love with this resort : []
rooms has a good balcoon but rooms hasnt wifi an wifi just there is in lobby and sppeds really low : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The food was excellent in all the restuarants in the hotel, prices are a little high but no more than what you pay in other 5 * hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I guess the rooms are becoming dated, but they have some much character and I have always found them to be very clean and well maintained : []
Greenish is every where, and the weather was really chilling : [u'location', u'sea']
The workers do their utmost to remove any beach litter : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Nusa Dua beach resort and others within this area are within easy access to Kuta, but if you want relaxation and quiet, we fully recommend : []
For those who will have meeting in those two convention centers better stay in this hotel : [u'amenities', u'patio']
This hotel is the perfect choice if you're looking for quality accommodation, quality restaurants, quality facilities and friendly, professional, efficient management all contained within a tropical, relaxing, oceanfront setting at an affordable price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We took a cab from the hotel and although it takes 45 mins each way it was worth the trip out : []
The staff were super friendly an always happy : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The time I did order a meal it came out cold and the 2 dishes my child and I were eating 20 minutes apart : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
it was a very nice last night in Bali : []
Room was large enough and the cleanliness was excellent ,our room was cleaned perfectly twice a day : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Prices for spa, meals and drinks etc are expensive : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Good choice of food, amazing beach and pools : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The Spa offers a range of services and we enjoyed a massage every 3 rd day : [u'amenities', u'gym']
They may approach you but a quick "No thank you" will be enough to send them on their way and they won't bother you again : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This hotel has the perfect location if you are looking for the beach and probably in the safest place in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
+ the funny thing is after the room boy explain the rooms facilities to my parents ,while my mom couldn't speak english, she only said "yes - thank you" :D : [u'overall', u'culture']
Can't fault it : []
The food was great clean rooms and staff were all lovery : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The Nusa Dua resort area is isolated somewhat and has limited eateries and bars in the area : [u'location', u'general']
Because it was ground floor we had room to sit around with 2 couples and have a drink at the end of the day on the balcony : []
And, the best of all, the wonderful breakfast buffet filled with so many delightful and tasty choices - an abundance for any palate : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Extremely highly recommended : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We had a great time in Brunei ,KL and Bali : []
It was fabulous value for money : []
I have been going to Bali for 15 years and it is time to salute the Hotel and the staff of this wonderful establishment : []
The bathroom fixtures were too of a poor and cheap quality which used to fall off and they were never replaced back : [u'overall', u'safety']
1- The price of food compare to good restaurants in Bali is really expensive and that is leaving a bad taste in the mouth : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We would go again for sure : []
My partner and I had the best time and look forward to taking our family back next year to stay in the Palace Club : [u'overall', u'culture']
Stayed here again September this year and the service was not as good ( some misunderstandings due to poor English) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast is multicultural with a wide array of choices and the many restaurants very nice but if they are not to your liking a short walk or taxi ride to Bali Collections will present with many more to choose from all at reasonable prices : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
both the room and the beach : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Local people set up shops along the bay if you walk far enough : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed 8 nights (jan 2015 2 adults & 4 1/2 year daughter) in a premier suite over looking the garden : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Breakfast is prepared in order to suit everyone's taste, i miss the buffet so much : []
There's also a sort of traditional amphitheatre with weekly balinese dance performances (and a delicious buffet) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the personal touch was great after only one day most staff remembered our names : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We got the palace club room which is very recommendable since you get to stay at the palace club, where the breakfast is much better, and you get evening tea and cocktail our included in room price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food in all areas was top class : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
the pools were beautiful and the beach so close : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I am so glad we did : []
The resort was very clean and the attention to the little detalis were great : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
After 30 mins we were told it would be another 30 mins : []
Very friendly and attentive staff and relaxing facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It would be great if the wifi was available in the rooms for the price that you pay it seems crazy to ask guest to pay another 100,000 rps per day for in room wifi : []
Visited June 2012 : [u'location', u'sea']
Bathrooms also good sized and seems like new fixtures have been added, which is always a nice touch : [u'amenities', u'conference']
00 for dinner, drinks and a magic show! Also, for water sports go to Bali Jet Set, diving with them is amazing, very professional outfit : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
We stayed in a second floor premier room with twin beds overlooking the garden and duck pond, and got a great deal on one of the booking websites suggested by Tripadvisor : []
The SPA and fitness area is also good : [u'location', u'general']
Housekeeping staff are friendly, clean room with personal service : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The breakfast buffet consisted of Asian and Western style foods : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We ate at the hotel pizza restaurant one night and it was really nice, along the beach front they have a fruit stand set up where you tell the guy what size plate you want and pick out different types of fruit then sit back by the pool and he brings it around to you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Having a few days of rain led us to find the games room which is situated above the gym : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This Resort is great : [u'amenities', u'pool']
On the bed was a display made with towels of two swans with red roses : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
30 pm and more of direction sign to help us? Would be better if the lift could be renovated as a bit slow : []
If we venture to Nusa Dua again, this will be our choice of accommodation : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall a great experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Excellent stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We arrived in the afternoon from Legian where we spent 8 days : []
It makes it difficult for those of us with small children trying to find a shady place to sit : []
The hotel is within walking distance to the Nusa Dua convention centre : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
----beautiful grounds which are so well kept & staff that are so pleasant,friendly & SO WILLING TO PLEASE : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I have stayed in 6 other hotels in Nusa Dua and have stayed here in my last 2 trips : []
On our third day, we need a room for family talk, and they gave the meeting room free of charge! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
It makes for a deeper knowledge of the local area or activities in the resort very challenging : []
Toilets are a bit cramp with no separate shower facility : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We stayed at the Nusa Dua for a week in a Club Room, the room was very good, restaurants very good and the staff were delightful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
the beach was BEAUTIFUL : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Selection of on-site restaurants and Bali Collection with its bars restaurants and shops is a 5 min cab ride away : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
I loved the water aerobics in the pool, the choice of restaurants, the massages at the spa and the adult pool at the spa : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Beach Hotel is a monumental hotel, the oldest in Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Only free in the lobby : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
The service is second to none and great packages available if you keep your eye out , this place is just good value : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The grounds and facilities are spectacular and extensive : [u'overall', u'safety']
Best part was, the staff were so very good and helpful! Amazing hotel, amazing people! : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
would recommend to all and love to go again !!! have a pleasant stay : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We stayed in a Palace club suite which was very large and spacious : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The other pool needs the bottom painted and it would also be very nice : []
Taxis can be taken into Kuta (around 15km away) and cost around 9 USD : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Restaurants were OK but again not that special : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
While the hotel is 5 star luxury it still has a traditional authentic Balinese feel : []
So the qestion is would I go back and it the answer is a qualified yes however I would just stay in the resort and that would be fine! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Every room came with a private balcony but beware of squirrels running around and staring at you! The bathroom was big with the bathtub and shower area separated : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I would highly recommend this hotel, it's probally not the most perfect hotel in Nusa Dua , I'm sure there are bigger and newer, but I think it would be hard to beat as far as staff friendliness and ambiance go : [u'overall', u'spacious']
We have stayed at three Hotels in Nusa Dua and I would rate this one the best : []
I once saw a tired mother with son who had fallen asleep in his chair - the staff offered to wheel the whole dinner to their room for no extra charge : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This hotel is really really a nice place to stay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
First night we stayed at Superior room which is old unrenovated room : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Our family also spent their nights in a delux room, and none of us had any complaints about the accommodation whatsoever : []
If you are looking for a modern - high end hotel with cutting-edge everything then this probably isn't the hotel for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only slight hitch was the average food at the bar near the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
All the staff made us feel very welcome : []
Everyone was very friendly and service was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
00 for 15 minutes,their wed site says they have a WHITE sand beach,no it is a sandy color beach,the beach and water looks beautiful when the tide is in put ugly when the tide is out,only thing I likes here was the pool and grounds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
dont worry they like to barter also : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The beach is also gorgeous : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We were a bit disappointed with spa; dark brown towels with traces of oil smell : []
I'm not normally a fan of exclusive areas developed at the expense of poorer areas in a 3rd world county and normally stay in the Legian area for a more genuine Balinese experience : []
Although our room was newly renovated we had a problem with the exhaust fan in the bathroom as it didn't work : []
The staff was fantastic most of all there were 2 staff members : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They even have a sand beach in the fresh water pool : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I like this hotel as it is very clean and with nice beach and view : []
In so far as the previous review to this hotel, I can only imagine he stayed in a different hotel to us : []
The hotel is great, and it is undoubtedly one of the finest hotels on the island : []
This hotel unlike the Laguna and Westin nearby that has bale that you can do a lazy lying at night to enjoy the sea breeze : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were very friendly and always asked how you were : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thank you to all staff and management for a great time : [u'location', u'sea']
A minor comment from me as regular gym user and attending yoga class, amenities like water, wet towel is no longer provided : [u'amenities', u'internet']
misleading advertising! : [u'location', u'sea']
We did enjoy our stay at the hotel but were a little disappointed in the standard of the accommodation (i : []
Expensive, but I guess you would expect that at a resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms were a little old, you can definitely feel it as well as see it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Normally I dont do anything like this but on this occasion I believed that I should write something about the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
There are 2 things I would say:- : []
The food is good but compared to what you can eat just a cab drive away is better and at a fraction of the price : [u'amenities', u'garden']
We had the best holiday ever : []
Even though I told them four times I would come to their BBQ they had no table available Others ran into the same problem yet I saw many tables unoccupied all evening : []
Even so, we liked the Nusa Dua a lot : []
Our room had 2 king singles : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Bali collection is a 15 minute walk and a great place to eat! : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
This year, after their renovation, I saw a different Nusa Dua Beach : []
I cannot speak too highly of the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
Rooms are comfortable but look old : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Most hotels don't have this : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The staff all through the hotel are incredibly friendly and always happy to help with any request : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
The lagoon pool offered a good alternative to swimmers who looked for a bit of sea-water feel and also proved to be highly popular with families with very young children as the kids could wade in easily and scooped up the sand with their buckets : [u'overall', u'culture']
Breakfast itself is amazing, definalty suggest getting the daily buffet : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
At last I will be good if you have night at jimbaran sea food restaurant : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Executive Club cocktail food is boring and tasteless compared to our previous stay, but the breakfast and service are great : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Our room had vaulted ceilings and two bathrooms with balcony running the full lengh of the two rooms (lounge and bedroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
It was all wrong with transactions that were not ours : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beautiful manicured grass and quite few different pools for kids and adults,clean and nice room : [u'overall', u'culture']
But if you have an issue you may just need to grin and bear it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There was a free shuttle servis to the open shopping Mall Collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Although they have variety food but still i can remembered all menu for 5 day stay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
What a fabulous experience we all had! The 8 day Indulgence package was absolutely brilliant and we used everything in our voucher and then some! The staff were wonderful and attentive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Machardi has been working at the hotel for years and was great to have a conversation with : []
Kids club was good but disappointing also as the activities were compulsory so my son could not going in and just 'play' : [u'overall', u'culture']
Our Fourth stay at this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Hopefully with a better room position : [u'room-experience', u'view']
Breakfast selection was great - especially loved the egg station : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
Find the large lap pool at the back of the Spa area near the tennis courts - no kids under 12 allowed and basically the pool area is empty 90% of the time : [u'location', u'general']
HOTEL: When I called the hotel to say we were celebrating an anniversary, they upgraded our room which was very nice : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel receives a lot of company workshops : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Staff are very courteous : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
OMG is all I can say : []
We stayed for ten nights in April 2015 and we were amazed at the excellent standards maintained by hotel staff from the quality of the food to the service provided by the attentive staff : []
Figure it's time to give it a try beside my favorite melia : []
This is an excellent gem of a resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had an issue where one staff member assured us there was an 8 seater van we could take to Seminyak for RP500,000 for 3 hours : []
Our room was also much nicer than expected, with gorgeous balcony views overlooking the tropical gardens of the hotel and Beach in the distance : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
This smaller dining area was impressive and very relaxing : [u'location', u'general']
- very dirty pool (green stuff growing on the walls) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Very nice location and the staff were lovely : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Other reviews suggest this hotel feels like a complex and isn't really the real Bali and I'd agree : []
Happy hour conditions applied differently between chess bar and lobby bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
For Chinese New Year we decided to go to Bali and celebrate my husband's birthday : []
With low alcohol content : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Booked a suite in the palace club section and well worth the extra expense : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I just found myself asking - whats the point : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Sea is full of jellyfish and sea urchins so is best avoided : [u'location', u'sea']
We were disappointed with our deluxe room so upgraded to a premium room which was perfect : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The restaurants are OK, Maduro has some tasty food but the Sashimi Chef needs a sharper knife! Dinner on the sand at the Chess Bar was a lot of fun : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They helped make our stay very comfortable and easy the accommodation and access for the wheelchair and the assistance given by the staff at all times was exemplary and we will certainly be back to enjoy another friendly stay here : []
"meet" at the airport to the private check in : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
So the security manager was extremely helpful in assisting me, getting us to the police station and helping me to fill out the police report for my travel insurance : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I did not expect to get charged for that : []
Rooms are spacious, clean, two times a day they come and check if you need anything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Perfect location, easy walk to the collection (main shopping centre) and the smaller village shops which are cheaper and have really good food and massages : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Food and Beverage: salivate : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The beach behind the hotel is whitely spread, so private and secluded : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
No amusement features in pools (such as slides for kids) : [u'overall', u'culture']
Like other 5 star hotels nearby, the drinks are pricy, like USD8++ for a cocktail, USD2++ for a small bottle of water : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
If you are looking for a five star resort that that you can relax and get away from it all, you will want to stay here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool area was fabulous : [u'location', u'general']
We both felt amazingly healthy, beautiful and rejuvenated at the end of our stay : []
Food is excellent as are the rooms and facilities Nusa Dua offers, we would love to come back! A special mention to Mariani in the tourism office, without her help and amazing personality the remainder of our trip in Bali would have been slightly chaotic - she's so great : []
This was the second time we have stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
The hotel is BIG : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Just arrived home after a great week at this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
But it took one and half hour to clean it and we were very tired after travelling : []
The spa well what can we say apart from the fact that the massages are wonderful the pool area was quiet and tranquil especially after a massage to go and have a peaceful swim so serene : [u'amenities', u'gym']
It was very easy to use the voucher system and the hotel were very accommodating with the voucher system also : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
Pool was very nice -- two pools, one of them quite big, with a swim-up bar : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
15 minute trip from the airport : [u'location', u'airport']
Another big recommendation is to go to Sakala - which is a fine dining place around 20 minutes away in Tanjung Benoa : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel also organised us a trip around Bali, up to the volcano and to the rice fields etc : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
KUTA was a complete disappointment, we intended to spend the day there, shop & eat & drink etc : []
Staff at the taxi/booking desk were most unhelpful and sour, the prices in the hotel shops were twice that of retail shops in Kuta! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
After touring NZ we required a relaxing 5 days : []
Great atmosphere with traditional Balinese architecture : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Hotels, services, magnifiquent spa, ocean, weather- everything for forgetting about nervous life : [u'overall', u'culture']
The pool was lovely and a long walk along the beach passed other hotels : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Surely will come back again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I found the speed good and only rarely had to resort to using cellular data : [u'overall', u'culture']
very safe : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Not a new hotel but one with lots of experience taking care of its western and european guests (oh and they have the cutest little animal here and there like squirrels in the trees, ducks in the ponds and other birds which all looked like they are loved and are just part of the resort) : [u'location', u'forest']
Breakfast and the dinner shows with amazing buffets were the best : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The only thing regrettable about the rooms is that some of them do not have bath tub and the drainage is a bit poorly constructed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub']
Evening entertainment is a plus : [u'overall', u'culture']
The rooms need a make over, again however, they were comfortable : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Perhaps some people are used to high end luxury that we have only some experience of and are making comparisons in that way, or perhaps some people can just never be happy and must find something to complain about : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Great pools : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our stay was via the Luxury Escapes package and we found the experience almost perfect : [u'overall', u'feel']
We spent 6 days and 5 nights from April 1 to April 6 at this hotel : []
We were in Rooms 1213 and 1214 and the patios and chairs on the patios were not clean very disappointed with the patios : []
The gardens are large, open and colourful : [u'amenities', u'garden']
I've enjoyed the stay b\overall but few problems one was the internet was too weak(even in-spite paying for it), second there was no control over the A/C except on?off finally, bath towels were over used : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens', u'bathrobe', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
It was just such a shame about the noise : []
Will definitely come back for the beach, pizza and jamu!!! Oh did I mention the spa was amazing too?! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Can see why so many people keep returning, time after time as we will be doing : []
The breakfast was very good with plenty of variety and fresh eggs, pancakes and waffles : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The location is also really nice, with a big white sand beach, where you can take a bath or have a nice dinner : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall, the room and hotel grounds are nice, but I did not go to Bali to stay at a hotel that could have been anywhere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is also a good place to stock up your bottled water : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food at the Pizzeria, on the other hand, was quite good, and we had an excellent Balinese dinner at Raja's restaurant (both within the hotel) : []
was not happy at all with my experience with this resort as I had called beforehand to settle all these details and apparently they were ignored : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
- reception provided me even with a yoga mat! Would love to have that in every hotel : [u'amenities', u'banquet', u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
We walked down to the markets at the entrance to Nusa Dua and dropped our laundry at the "Oriental Day Spa" : []
Your staff are very polite and most attentive, especially in the Palace Club : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Night walks on the path are encouraged as there are always security patroling : []
The resort bathrooms were the smallest we have ever experienced in Bali,unable to accomodate more than one person at any given time : []
I think it unfair that adults having a lovely relaxing drink at the pool bar have to put up with small children yelling and screaming : [u'overall', u'culture']
All staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It's such a shame because the hotels all seem to be of a good standard, and the people are genuinely nice people : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel itself is incredibly beautiful, when you drive up the driveaway along the architecture blows your mind, the food is fantastic, the rooms are clean and the staff are the best I have come across anywhere in the world : []
Would not stay here again as there are too many excellent alternatives to choose from : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This resort is well known for the people of Bali and tourist who love Bali as one of the best resorts in Nusa Dua and in Bali in general : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Hotel location right on the beach, and a walk way path accessible to all the other hotels in the area : [u'location', u'general']
We walked down to Bali Collections which is a great shopping centre with many restaurants - all much more reasonably priced than eating at the Hotel and they had great entertainment also : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
then you get to the rooms : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beautiful hotel, gorgeous grounds, fantastic pools - thank goodness, given it was over 32 degrees with well over 90% humidity each day we were there! We were only in Bali for five full days, and spent two and a half of them lazing by (and in) the pool : []
A nice touch : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
15 minutes along beachfront walkway to Bali Collections (shopping and restaurants) or 20 to 30 minute drive to Discovery Shopping Centre in Kuta : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
This was our first trip to Bali and we were recommended to stay at the nusa dua beach hotel by friends and we were not disappointed : []
My little girl loves sitting at the pool bar drinking coke( which she is not allowed normally) : [u'overall', u'culture']
For the sake of a 10 minute walk or 3 minute taxi ride I don't understand why anyone would eat at the hotel?! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food and beverages have increased in price a little too much for my liking so you wander just outside and head towards Benowa where you will find loads of restauants selling Indonesian food at much cheaper fare and its yummy, I have been to Bali 15 times and always eat from little restaurants and I have never been sick : []
The beach is pretty poor and in August has lots of sea urchins (?) and no waves at all : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The spa is wonderful and the staff there are very attentive : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
All what I wanted just a clean room with the same location as we had at first : []
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is a wonderful place to stay with lots of opens space, greenery and a beach adjacent to the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
very average : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My wife, daughter and I stayed here for five nights in August 2014 and had a tremendously enjoyable stay : [u'overall', u'culture']
Spa was well worth the visit : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
However, i felt the overall warmth is missing : [u'location', u'sea']
Service was outstanding at both the Conrad and the NDBH : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
had a very great experience and everythng in hotel is very convenient : [u'overall', u'feel']
Tables on the beach, lanterns around : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
It took time to get one installed and get the remote etc : []
Everything was prepared immaculately for us; from 3 towels, 3 beds, 3 umbrellas, 3 of everything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We weren't sure what to expect of our visit - but this place really gets under your skin by the time you leave! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Free wifi is available in the public areas of the complex but not in rooms (additional cost for in room internet) : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The room is very clean, fresh sheets every day, towels twice a day if you want, free water, ice if needed and supper delivered to the room if so desired : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
this place really natural and beautiful with fishpond and crane so my baby enjoyed his breakfast experince : [u'overall', u'culture']
Staff were always pleasant & courteous, from the front desk to the room attendants, the gardeners & maintenance staff we couldn't fault them : []
All staff were focussed on ensuring we had a great time : []
Nusa Dua is a very nice resort area : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Gorgeous hotel, staff really courteous, friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
much cheaper at the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The spa is amazing with an endless list of packages available along with a private pool which does not allow alcohol, children under 12yo and most important smoking enabling you to relax in a child and smoke free environment : [u'amenities', u'conference']
best seating is near the small pond wherein i happily fed the fishes with croissants :) : []
The voucher passport was fantastic and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to escape the hustle and bustle of Kuta : []
I really appreciated their sincerity : []
This was following a business trip so we wanted to relax, and we were pretty much able to do just that : []
Peaceful with a happy vibe : [u'overall', u'spacious']
Nice beach restaurant called Chess and you can hire various water sports equipment : [u'amenities', u'gym']
back to Kuta and eat in the cheaper restaurants or off the street : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
It is probably the best place in Nusa Dua for that kind of vacation : []
As you proceed through the lobby, downstairs is the breakfast buffet, which has an amazing selection of tropical fruit : [u'amenities', u'conference']
com for any further questions just go you wont be dissapointed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Alternatives outside the hotel need a taxi ride so you feel trapped with everything 2 to 3 times more expensive than you would expect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hotel Service (10 out of 10) : []
Good service, nice pool, geat breakfast : []
Very nice hotel with 3 nice swimming-pools (1 with trees and sand) and beautiful gardens (squirrels included!) : [u'amenities', u'garden']
They are polite and absolutely loveable : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
After 2 days complaining about waking up each morning covered in bites they did change the mattress & pillows which stopped the problem : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Accurate services and very good choice of food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Staff knowledge and information of the activities around each day need to be improved as well as overall marketing : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
From the moment you walk through the Balinese gates into the complex your stress melts away : [u'location', u'general']
A couple of minor issues with the wifi in our room but all in all Avery relaxing stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast buffet has everything you could wish for reception staff and concierge service faultless : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Went to Bali to attend a wedding at the nearby Conrad Hotel also on Nusa Dua Island : [u'location', u'sea']
Breakfast was also great but can get very busy,make sure you go early or late but not around 9:30 as it gets a little chaotic : []
The hotel is best and we enjoyed stayed over there : []
From the time we arrived until we left, we really enjoyed everything about this hotel : []
The breakfast buffet was good and quite large : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
This is my 2nd time staying at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa because the first time was so impressive : [u'location', u'sea']
pool table and fuse ball were missing parts, kids don't really care though : [u'room', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'conference']
I would definitely go back for another weekend getaway! : []
The aircon was okay, though in the humid temperatures you cannot expect air con to work perfectly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The buffet breakfast is fantastic with a lot of choice : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights : []
The Deluxe room was pretty nice, not outstanding, attention to detail in some parts were lacking, especially in the bathroom, where nothing was square : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It costs like USD40++ (excluding drink) for a Korean bbq dinner for 2 : []
As this was a special occasion we paid to upgrade to a Palace Club Room, the room was lovely, very spacious, imaculately clean & comfortable with a huge bed, and great bathroom area, the furniture in the room (cabinets, chairs, t : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
They even objected us to take picture from sky near to the Public beach on local New Year eve : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
00 US room credit to be spent on food beverage or spa during our stay : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The room was always cleaned when we were out : []
It was worth the extra expense staying in the Royal club, which provided a welcome haven : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The spa was the best ever : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
We used a promotion from deals : []
My rooms was obvious not been used for a long time so it need some freshen up, but after a day it was clean and fit for use : []
We stayed on the top level (can't remember room number) viewing pool area : []
The staff - from beach cleaners to hotel managers is smiling and welcoming you 24-7, whatever you need or ask for is done for you fast and with most sincere smile (special thanks and hello to manager Madi for prompt help and great attitude) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff are the best asset the hotel has : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The toilet and bedroom had a window that are mean to be opened haha ~~~~ But during my stay I actually had to pay separately for my WIfi connection that is something I dont understand after all customer had paid premium price for the stay and the wifi felicities is there why don't they just allow the customer to use it lolz : []
One thing I definately recommend, is eating at the hotels seafood buffet on Sunday nights and having the buffet at the cultural show which I think is on a wednesday night : []
Jetski rental was fun : [u'room', u'furniture']
Staff go above and beyond to make your stay a memorable one : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The Breakfast buffet was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Mini bar is overpriced so shop in the village for drinks and snacks : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The pool is fun and opens up right to the sandy beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
I had it twice : []
Staff still excellent and friendly and helpful : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The gardens, Spa and swimming pools are very well presented and enduce a peaceful aura of relaxation : [u'amenities', u'garden']
It's the second time for us at Nusa Dua Beach this time we brought our 2 young boys (6 & 4) with us : []
Head down to Ubund for some shopping : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
Yes, the shower in the bathroom has a useless rain head and we do recommend exploring eating establishments outside for the true Balinese cuisine but we would certainly stay here again : []
- Palace Club rooms have "private" grounds in which to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the hotel, same with breakfast : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They went out of their way to accomodate me and make me happy!They were very caring I was allocated a room with a shower and moved me to one with a bath when I requested it : []
Set away from the throngs of people in the serene district of Nusa Dua, this hotel is harmonious and wonderfully tranquil! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Massages are also wonderful! : [u'amenities', u'gym']
I really liked the traditional rooms , flowers and all colours are adorable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The guy making the omelettes did a great job with all the demand too! Lovely breakfast room with a great view : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I think being so relaxed in this beautiful hotel resort made it so easy to sleep : []
All in all, another good stay, but may try a different hotel next time : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The only downside for us (a couple of oldies!) was the number of overindulged, small children, whose behaviour spoiled many of our restaurant meals : [u'overall', u'culture']
We had privacy and so did our children, but kept our door between rooms most of the time : []
Great show of balinese dances every Tuesday in the outside theater : [u'amenities', u'banquet']
A few upgrades needed here and there but I wouldn't fault this resort too much : []
Resort itself, beautiful buildings, architecture was fascinating and the surrounds were ideallic : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We loved our time here and can thoroughly recommend this hotel wholeheartedly : []
In a way, we were really glad that we spent our entire days at the beach while at Nusa Dua : []
I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to anyone : []
Bfast spread is awesome there are some nice eateries just outsode also and they pick you up and drop you also at the hotel : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
1 hour traditional Balinese massage was perfect in the spa : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Still, I can't imagine staying here again : []
I would prefer Pizza Hut or Domino's : []
The duty manager ( I believe his name was Mr : [u'overall', u'culture']
Short walk from Bali Collection, although it took us a few attempts to find the shortest route there! All the staff were very helpful and friendly but get to the breakfast buffet early for the best selections - an amazing variety of choice! Didn't have time to try the spa but on a return trip would definitely try it : []
The Indonesian restaurant on site was not popular and the food was not as good as the Asian restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
As a rule we like to leave our hotel, go for a stroll and pop into a few bars/restaurants etc, there is very little around nusa dua at all and as the weather wasn't great when we were there we felt a bit bored, though it is cheap and easy to get taxis to jimbaran kuta etc and excursions to ubud etc are also cheap and you will get private tours and your own guides which is great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It was great : []
Our average rating of the Spa does not at all refer to the Spa staff : [u'location', u'sea']
on the beach ,lots of sun beds : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
This hotel is located in a secluded area with only five star hotels in Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The grounds are well kept and the staff are just beautiful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The hotel offered us the same type of room upstairs - however, we had a GUARANTEED downstairs pool view premier room - as the hotel were refurbishing the other downstairs rooms we could not have what we booked -so they gave us a larger room (club premier room) ground floor but no pool view : [u'room-experience', u'view']
We ate after this experience at the Laguna & Westin & were more than satisfied : []
If you're coming to Bali to see culture and a beautiful island, don't bother coming to this whole area : [u'overall', u'culture']
The rooms are spacious, we were concerned about the construction works mentioned by other travellers, but actually it was not noticeable that half of the hotel was undergoing some reconstruction everything was neat and quite : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Having travelled through a lot of Asian countries I/we have not come across such genuinely happy/smiling staff members of a luxury hotel like this one : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This hotel is among three or four other hotels who are within walking distance to Bali International Convention Center(BICC) and Bali Nusa Dua Convention Center (BNDCC) : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Overall it was a decent stay but after being so impressed the first time around, I was a little bit disappointed and I think that the next time I visit Bali, I can venture off and try another hotel (in the same area) : [u'location', u'sea']
There are also a few massage parlours outside the hotel that offer a good massage for an hour for reasonable prices : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
From the onset the staff provided amazing service which was friendly, helpful and efficient : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We could not have dealt with our crisis as well as we did had it not been for Peter and the Palace Club Team : []
We enjoyed lunches most days at the Chess Bar on the beach and were delighted with the food and service (the black sesame prawns are a must!) As we had learned from previous visits to Bali the bars and restaurants outside of the hotels offer great value and excellent food especially if you want to try the more local food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The beach wasn't as spectacular as all the reviews said : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Courteous & friendly staff, prompt service, neat & clean & great location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 4 nights to the end of May 2012 : []
However, if you're going to relax on the beach and have no worries about food and accommodation then you can't do much better than this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are outdoor shows on twice a week with an amazing buffet dinner : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Will return again in March next year : [u'location', u'sea']
This is my 4th time to this resort always staying in the Palace club suites : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staffs were magnificent,they were very polite and courteous : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast is very good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
really you go there for the hotel and the hassle free beaches : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The staff are all really friendly, helpful and pleasant : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We booked a 3 night stay in the Agung Suite ($800 AUD per night) & were upgraded to the amazing 'Nusa Dua Suite' - the President of Japan had stayed in it prior to us for the APEC Meeting in Bali : []
We did not rush around sightseeing as this was our annual holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Lesson -- don't request an ocean view : [u'room-experience', u'view']
Never got it but Wifi was good : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We also ate at a restaurant at the Bali Collective - a lovely 10 miunte walk from the hotal along the beach path - this was good but expensive, and at Jimbaran Beach - great for sunsets and fresh fish : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We meet some lovely people from Australia, Russia and Saudi Arabia : []
With our package we had the option of upgrading to a premier room at the extra cost of $200 : []
Excellent service, staff were friendly and have made life long friends, My hubby and I stayed here at Christmas time when i was pregnant, hotel was clean, food was safe and delicious! we just got back with our 5 month old son, He had an absolute ball with all the attention from staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Exceeded our expectations, food and cocktails lovely : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My review is as follows: : [u'amenities', u'internet']
For young children it is a nice place to stay : []
The staff are so nice and keen to help : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The limited number of hawkers allowed on the beach were friendly and not pushy, making for relaxing shopping if interested : [u'location', u'sea']
In fact, this hotel could be in Mexico or anywhere else there is a beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Hotel was awesome roughly $150K to Kuta and $70k to Jimbaran Bay from the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We enjoyed them very much : []
The room we stayed in was a Premium room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Nusa Dua beach hotel is a fantastic and impressive complex : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food at the resort can be and should be better : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We fell in love with the Balinese culture and I love this hotel : []
My husband really enjoyed the squash courts and was able to get a game easily whenever he wanted at a good standard : [u'overall', u'safety']
Oh ya, I suggest you to request the room at 1st floor with pool view, really recommended : [u'room-experience', u'view']
With a 5 star resort comes 5 star prices : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We love the ambience and the traditional architecture : []
Drinks around pool very overpriced though and food there is quite bland and tasteless compared with options at nearby locations : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Location (7 out of 10) : []
Please, don't let these guys slip through the corporate fingers : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
e laundry, spa etc but I guess if you want the serene setting then you'll have to pay for it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
To the other tourists: please don't take a stack of slice bread (9 pieces) and throw them to the fishes : []
would reccomend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a hotel in the nusadua area : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We stayed for 3 days and throughout the days, we were happy with their services : []
The variety at the breakfast buffet was amazing, more than enough to keep you going until dinner : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Again I must mention the service in the palace club, excellent! : []
I was surprised by the really nice and hospitable attitude of not just the management but each and every employee : []
Will go back again to enjoy : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Best value 5 star family escape ever : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The people who served us were so friendly and lovely and the two massages I had were so relaxing and reviving : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
As always, we spent 3 days in Nusa Dua after a few days in Seminyak : []
The main entrance is spectacular with a superb lobby : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
No request too hard : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
low quality if food for very highly priced menus!!!! when the average salary is 200USD we paid 60 USD for 2 main course and a salad & 2 beers! Italian pizza is not Italian!!!! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Overall a very nice vacation and a place to recommend : [u'amenities', u'gym']

Swimming pool was clean, so is the overall hotel area : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
I have visited Bali many times before however this was my first time in Nusa Dua; this area is perfect for a romantic couples trip or families (probably too quiet for singles- go to Seminyak or Legian) : [u'location', u'general']
One of the best weddings and times I have experienced : []
The pool areas are well maintained : [u'location', u'general']
I have no problem in moving to these lounges if they are left empty , hotels always say they enforce a no reservation rule on sunbuds but never do, much easier to enforce the rule yourself : [u'overall', u'safety']
What a nice surprise to find that the pictures don't do this place justice and the staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We were very impressed with the look of this hotel as it looks like a Balinese temple at the entrance : []
- Excellent breakfast and housekeeping : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And I enjoy staying at different hotels each time : []
The staff were so friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
as the rooms were quite old and dated : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']

There is a good Kids Club at the Resort : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The hotel is situated at a convenient location, close to the Airport : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Great location and will definitely recommend to others : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Massages are available to the left of the beach as you walk out of the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel has an old world charm, however needs some refurbishment : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The pool was the best : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Lots for kids to do : [u'overall', u'culture']
It was very interesting and beautiful! Try to go later in the day to get a picture of it at sunset! : []
It has everyting you need no mather where you from!If you want to go somewhere else eat or go to shopping theres a bus going to collection a shoping gallery every hour : [u'location', u'airport', u'station']

I will definitely go back there again : []
Loved the pool bar and the happy hour cocktails : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
This added benifit i would recommend! The staff are all very warm and welcoming, which we found to be a bit of fresh air! they always said hello from the manager down to the cleaner/gardener would always stop and smile and ask how you are? : []
Family of four stayed in two double rooms interconnected : [u'overall', u'culture']
Excellent waitress : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I must say the staff really went all way out to satisfy the needs of their guests : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I travelled here with friends for a relaxing vacation, and that is exactly what we got : []
Overall great experience and very recommendable stay : []
After the four days without some of our luggage we were surprised when a basket arrived containing shirts, bikinis etc - a very welcome and unexpected gift : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Love you guys x : []
There appeared to be enough beds around the pool, but it may be busy if you went later on in the season : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
After having spend wonderfull days in two fabulous boutique hotels (Alila) this hotel was just too big for us : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Over all a fabulous holiday, this hotel is perfect for families : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We're fully informed from the previous guests' review here so we were prepared, but still, to think a 5-star hotel with no internet connection available is definitely silly : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We had stayed there nine years ago and enjoyed it then , we were not disappointed this time : []
For my first visit to Bali I was glad my accommodation was at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
The hotel has tremendous charm and you can soak in the Balinese architecture and culture : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You can also walk to the shops along the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed on a 10 night package and thoroughly enjoyed could not fault a thing,beautiful Balinese grounds very relaxing, pleasant room with amazing bed which was a great surprise, great facials and massages : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We opted for the Palace Club for our stay, on arrival whisked away for a private check in : []
We rented a taxi and guide for a few days, so cheap and helped us explore the real bali : []
This is a nice walk from the hotel along the beach, or there is a free transfer available from most hotels : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The room size was generous, plenty of dining options, and amazing and efficient staff/service : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel is in true Balinese style with lovely gardens, pools etc but their biggest asset is their wonderful staff : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The theme dinners were great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We tended to walk outside the Nusa Dua gates and eat in the local restaurants which were much cheaper : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They were building a new hotel next door and the noise was unbearable at times : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Do check with concierge for the schedule : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The Nusa Dua area is quite far from the other tourism locations in Bali : [u'location', u'general']
One was the Business Centre : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There is also a market area out the front of the middle gate, which was handy : [u'amenities', u'conference']
However room needs upgrading, bathroom small and bed squeaky : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
We felt the Spa was of very high quality and even better than some we have attended at other (unnamed) 5 star resorts : []
The surroundings with its beautiful gardens, pools and beach where very relaxing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Highly recommend for families : [u'overall', u'culture']
Which we paid, but this made it disappointing : []
Nusa Dua Beach: Landscape, Bali feels, Friendliness : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Nice swinmming pool and large beach : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Although the property is one of the originals in Nusa Dua it is very well maintained : []
Overall, a wonderful trip : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We did something we have never done before and booked the same hotel for the second year : [u'location', u'sea']
nice pool and gardens : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Woodwork in bathrooms need cleaning up and fresh wood sealing : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
The coffee house where breakfast is served is by a pond which is so picturesque : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Upgrade to the club area, it's worth it : []
Staff were amazing and I am already planning my return trip :) if you want luxury and relaxation then this place is perfect : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
to be covered in ants each morning either and yes i know it is an outside area but there are ways to prevent this from happening : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They seems to be cleaned all through the day but keep coming back with the tides : [u'location', u'sea']
We set up some tours with the aid of the hotel tour guide and recommend discussing the options with the guide to find what suites your interests : []
we chose this resort for our first OS family holiday as it looked clean safe and impressive and it was certainly all of those : []
The upkeep they have on the beach and their garden is amazing! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Other services such as internet and laundry were fine, but again, overpriced : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Transport is a problem : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff is wonderful and food quite tasty : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Came back here for the first time since the early nineties with a little trepidation but need not have worried : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Other guests we spoke to used the taxis outside the hotel gates we probably would to but didn't want to walk all that way ( entrance to hotel is a long road) with the two small children : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
We stayed at the hotel for our honeymoon, my husband and I, and it was one of the best experiences ever : []
The Nusa Dua section of the island of Bali is almost like a "gated community" in itself : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We brought in some wine and food to have on balcony and they went and got us wine glasses, plate cutlery, napkins etc : []
It was such a pleasure to see them come for their feeding and the cameras would be flashing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Strolling her to sleep along the ocean was a dream come true! The pools at the hotel are wonderful, with a variety to choose from and there are several dining options as well : [u'location', u'sea']
We done a day tour with Bali Essential Tours and had Kadek as our guide : []
They were more than helpful in arranging restaurant and transport bookings whether in the resort or outside in the town : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Whilst being a modern 5 star resort : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I was told by a local that if you want spa treatments, it is better to go off site : []
Food in the restaurants was ok but the service was very slow particularly in the Chess Bar restaurant - bring your patience with you! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The locale is remote from the hustle and bustle and provides for a relaxing opportunity to recharge your batteries and enjoy the moment : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Comparing to the rest of South Kuta, you do feel like you are out of no where, but for family holidays and novice travelers to Bali or South East Asia, it is perfect, the resort has almost everything one needs and it's in a safe and well manicured (but man made) part of Bali : []
We stayed in a Palace Club room for 8 nights and wish we had of stayed for 3 weeks : []
Staff very kind and helpful is the best : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Definitely recommend this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
As for the hotel, there is not much else to say other than perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
100% recommend paying the extra for a Palace Club stay, we had a suite which was lovely : [u'amenities', u'conference']
So I would not advise people to book in advance and pay in full : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I really liked the more Balinese styling and grounds of this hotel : []
Especially impressed with security when I forgot to lock my safe when going out for a day trip : []
I loved the beach and the room : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
That's not to say we couldn't still explore Bali and we did so, but the hotel was a nice stress-free environment to return to each day : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Go to Bumbu Bali for real Indonesian and dance show on Wed or Fri nights and also Coco's : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Other than this initial problem which was quickly forgotten we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel, it has a special charm about it that most of the newer hotels in the area really lack : [u'location', u'general']
Overall great value : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We had a massage by the beach which costs less than AU$7 : [u'amenities', u'conference']
There are 2 pools : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The beach would have been a bit cleaner : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
If you are looking for a relaxing breakfast, that is the wrong place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Value for money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Security protects this area very closely, but we felt no concerns in the area : [u'location', u'general']
The new tollway from the airport really impressed : [u'location', u'airport']
Do yourself a favour and stay here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms were fabulous, the staff and service excellent and the hotel facilities and location superb : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We stayed at the hotel for a week in August with my husband and two young kids and the hotel exceeded our expectations : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Poor Adi was very embarrassed about the hotel's accounting system & apologized for the error : []
The staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful they always stopped to say hello during passing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort is huge with beautiful balinese garden and statures : [u'amenities', u'pool']
As you can tell it is all about the food, as I work as a cater : []
We spent two weeks here last January : []
Various evening entertainments are offered, such as typical Bali dances or barbecues by the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
art collections are amazing : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Internet in a room was not free of charge (Rp : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The location is a dream, beautiful beach and the facilities at the hotel are wonderful : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Wayan Sariati and front office staff, I should conguratulate Mr : []
Drinks aren't cheap but you are staying at a resort so expect to pay resort prices : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel has beautiful grounds and location is great right on a private beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel is beautiful considering it is 30 years old, The grounds are amaculate staff very friendly : [u'overall', u'safety']
We all took advantage of our free massages : []
This is not a practice I would allow : []
This was our first holiday without our three young children and we wanted to stay somewhere peaceful and luxurious : []
Plenty of deck chairs around all pool areas and on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The grounds are amazingly gorgeous and well kept : [u'overall', u'safety']
The drinks and food in the mini bar were expensive as expected, we went to Bali Collection and stocked up on the same things for a quarter of the price : []
Overall service was great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There is a beautiful lake in the middle of the grounds with ducks, lizards, turtles and a white heron : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We had booked for 4 nights at NDBH coming from Legian : []
As it was our wedding we pushed the boat out and booked a palace club suite which had all the benefits of being a palace club member which were worth the extra cost : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Kadek Dwi Ariani, who has been very helpful with all the questions and requests : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We have just returned from the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa, and I cannot praise it highly enough : []
It's embarrassing to see fellow tourist act like complete rude idiots by cutting lines, hovering over tables and yelling : []
Good breakfast spread : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfasts are amazing and it's just so relaxing to sit by the beautiful pond and watch all the fish, lizards and birds while you listen to Balinese music : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Service in Palace / Club outstanding : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Nusa Dua is a quieter location away from the hustle and bustle : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
(saved queuing at the airport you just went straight to the online check in desk) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Palace Club was jist like coming home the service by the staff was excellent and they never forget you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
As there is not much close by we hired a car for $20 a day including insurance : []
They should have some live entertainment at night, a band or lounge singer : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We spent 2 days just at the hotel and other days out sightseeing : []
Room was clean and spacious with decorative timber detailing : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The location is great, the facilities a bit dated but well maintained, grounds beautiful, staff friendly but generally very poorly trained, the food very close to horrible and WAY over priced for what you get : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
At any one time there were maybe one or two kids there : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
) The hotel, food and staff were excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
An absolutely fantastic hotel!!! From the staff to the resort and facilities!! I can not think of a thing to fault and will be back for sure : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One of the nice things about the spa is that they allowed kids as young as 12 to get treatments, so my daughter appreciated that! : [u'overall', u'culture']
We found prices within the hotel were excessive for the quality received and the dining service was often very slow, we had the feeling the place was often understaffed in the restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
It is an old resort but has been maintained very well : []
But don't complain as it was free : []
Service is ok : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast was delicious, such a good choice and so fresh : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']

A complimentary birthday cake when it was my daughter's 6th birthday was just one of little extras they provide : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Location rather isolated but Taxi's cheap : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We had our best meals in Frangipani and Ocean in the Bali Collection - very tasty and reasonable : []
As we strolled down the long stretch of beach (Westin and Laguna by Westin were next door), I couldn't help but look on in envy of their resort facilities and rooms where our friends were staying : [u'overall', u'culture']
The breakfasts were awesome in a very nice restaurant with everything you ever want to eat : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They gave us the complimentary use of one of the hotel taxis to transport us to the hospital and to the airport : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Still, would like to note a couple of things : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The food in all hotel restaurants is good, the spa as well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We would not return to this property, no matter how pretty the pictures : []
Beautiful I stayed for 3 days and could not find a single instance or area where it falls short : []
First time in Bali, thoroughly enjoyed our stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had two dinners outside, in Nusa Dua city and those couldn't compare with the quality of the dinners we had in the hotel : []
We had the buffet dinner on Fridays by the beach which had fire dancers performances, quite enjoyable : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We had a great time with our packaged deal : []
Good selection of food and cheaper than hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

Took 5 phone calls and 30 minutes to get someone to take it out : []
A beautiful fresh flower arrangement and bowl of fresh fruit are lovely touches when you first arrive into the room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was great value as we received 6 free massages 3 free dinners and 1 free pizza : []
It was a nice trip there, thank you very much : []
Site location is good, clean beach and not any noise : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
At night it is an easy walk to eat or drink at one of the other 4 - 5 star hotels nearby : []
We stayed in a deluxe room that faced the pool and the ocean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were always attentive and eager to please : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There was plenty to do if you want to be active (tennis courts, squash courts, table tennis, pool table, chess tables, spa, lap pool, basketball, bikes for hire etc), as well as daily scheduled activities to join in to if you want : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Most beautiful lobby, you instantly feel relaxed upon arrival : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food is also at a very high level from any of its 5 restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
I had to have one every night during my stay : []

Hotel setting and facility was very good,staff else where in other departments of hotel were exelent and always very helpfull : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Recommended stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Themed dinners were delicious and entertaining, although you did not want to have a late booking as food would run out : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
One is the classical one, with comfortable sunbeds around it, and it has a poolbar in the swimmingpool : []
We were very impressed with the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
The main pool is fantastic, very deep - for a change:)) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We could stay in the hotel for the whole day and weren't bored at all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Stayed here for a week at a business conference at the Bali International Convention Center next door at the Westin, during my first trip to Bali and Indonesia : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Awesome if your looking to just relax and don't mind paying a premium : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The beach is cleaned early each morning, giving us a nice place to relax and enjoy the ocean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']

We went to Bali to celebrate our wedding anniversary : []
Information counter staff was very helpful in getting us a baby sitter during nyepi so that my wife and I could go for our spa, kudos to her : [u'overall', u'culture']
Both times we went into the jacuzzi we were the only ones there and at the lap pool there were 2 other people in lounges in the shade and we were the only ones in the water : []
The massages are also excellent : [u'amenities', u'gym']
On a plus side for the hotel i have to say the landscaping was beautiful and really made the hotel for me : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The staff were friendly and welcoming : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Go to Celuk to see the silversmiths create exquisite native jewelry- kind of expensive but worth it to have something so beautiful that was hand made : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Location is great, close to Bali Collections, New Hospital and all water sports : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
If you are not aware of this fact before you visit Bali, I would be criticising your travel agent, not the hotel : []
Our only observation was that there was no after dinner entertainment on site so you could not adjourn to the cocktail bar and enjoy an after dinner drink, music and have a place to dance, it all seemed to wind down a little early : []
Regards to the staff, The Truly Awesome Concierge Guys and the Spa ladies who helped iron out our Backpacker knots : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Rooms fairly small despite being given a supposed double upgrade to a palace room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The hotel is old but the beach front is huge and welcoming : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We also enjoyed the nice restaurants with a large selection including gluten free items on the menu : []
- The satff are very kind and helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
True Balinese feel : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Can't wait to go back : []
Worth an early evening stroll to see the sunset : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My husband and I were going to take our honeymoon there- and I wanted to have something special waiting there so "Arini" helped me: order a beautiful 'honeymoon' cake (that was delicious!!), and have a beautiful card and a bouquet that was there waiting for him with my words printed on it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The grounds were beautifully landscaped and the pools area was huge with plenty beds available : [u'location', u'general']
However, the breakfast was amazing: food, choice, staff were a credit to the hotel and unfortunately one of it's only redeeming features : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We preferred to go out for lunch or dinner in Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Once in pool, all was fogotten! Views on 3rd & 4th floors of beach & pool were divine : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Beautiful traditional Balinese hotel : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Was confused why our family booking of 6 people didn't have the adjoining room door but it was very quickly fixed : []
I was a little apprehensive that 2 teenagers might find Nusa Dua a little boring, but not so : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Although our package was good value and included meals at the resort and spa treatments, we were disappointed a little with the quality of the food : []
30 and saw only a few people : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
we liked the resort but we would probably not stay here again : []
You have to love those squirrels! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We used our time to unwind and relax : []
average for overall : [u'location', u'sea']
ocean not really swimmable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was a nice place to be, with several different things to do but at the same time it gives you the chance to chill out and relax : []
Security was also excellent : [u'overall', u'safety']
Definately will return in future : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The toiletries seemed old and dirty : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
staff were absolutely lovely and our room was very practical for our family (duplex room for 4) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I would recommend staying here if you want to not get hassled and bothered by anyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Given that size, It could turn into something practical and lively : []
Of our 5 day holiday, we spent 4 days entirely in the resort : []
We like to mix up Nusa Dua with a couple of days in Seminyak (at the W last time) and the combination is great : [u'location', u'sea']
Room rate was at USD 180 which I thought was alright given my good experience, recent good reviews and the fact that it is a 5-star resort : []
There is also the Nusa Dua Village which is approximately 20 minutes walk out of the resort (or a AU$2 : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Whilst some critisise the hotel as being dated (fair enough) the hotel has aged with dignity; the gardens and beach front are simply first class : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Finally, when we tried to arrange transportation back to the airport, my husband had to talk with three different people in order for us to get arrangements back to the airport : [u'overall', u'culture']
oh and the shower didn't work so washed off in the bath on the 1st night : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
After 12 years of visiting bali had my first case of bali belly on the first morning after eating breakfast and remained I'll for the duration of the 3 days - so glad to move onto our regular resort : []
We also had a spa treament and massage included in our wedding package and it was amazing : []
However, the hotel offers a true Balinese experience, the staff are gracious and ever willing to help, the buildings and rooms have a charm of its own (don't worry, they're all clean) and the grounds are just gorgeous : [u'overall', u'safety']
Nusa Dua Resort & Spa is truly beautiful and unforgettable : [u'amenities', u'pool']
There is a good selection of choices for breakfast and the chess bar by the beach serves very good beef and lamb kebab : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The food at all the resorts restaurants was delicious and the breakfasts were amazing, the variety of different food was incredible : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The hotel has many restaurants and they are all delicious and of a very high standard (for Bali), the food here is beautiful but very expensive, after 10days we would have spent a few thousand AUD dollars on food and drinks here : []
By this time, we were so tired and the kids were getting cranky so we just accepted the room : []
Its service down fall again, is most probably not notable for a relaxed family holiday, and if 5 star experience it not what is in one's mind : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It still offers a really high standard of service, well equipped rooms and a fabulous beachfront location : []
Divine swimming pools (get up early and put your towel onto a deck chair around the pool - or miss out) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Excellent for families: many opportunities for kids to play : [u'overall', u'culture']
The sports facilities were good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I would recommend this place although these resorts are quite expensive compared to going into the towns for drinks and meals : [u'amenities', u'pool']
After I stayed here last April 2012, me and my wife stayed again in June 2012 because we love this hotel and there was a special deal that we couldn't resist : []
a bit rich when we all know that they are probably paying about $50 per month for broadband : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There are insufficient variety of local dishes : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Meals at hotel on the expensive side but three themed dinners were included in our package : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The day spa was outstanding! : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
5) Toilet basin was stuck : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Kids loved and enjoyed feeding the fish every day in the foyer : [u'overall', u'culture']
Wish we could be here more often : []
Wear sunscreen even if it's cloudy! It was a beautiful resort and well kept, clean, quiet and the spa services were terrific : []
Find a local 7-11 or Circle K supermarket and stock up there : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Recommended as excellent value for money mid-range hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Make sure you don't waste your money on hotel taxi's, just walk out of the gate and you will find taxies for half the price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Why would you put whole green chilli in salad? The early morning complementary refreshments by the beach was a nice surprise with the staff there especially Dewchtha very friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You are isolated here, a number of hotels within walking distance : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast had a huge variety and lovely position looking out to the gardens : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
They give you enough! The bed was also big enough to fit me and our baby, so we don't have to push one another around just to get enough space room : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
But for us, we will surely return to staying in Seminyak/Legian Area : []
Walking to the private beach from the hotel is just 5 minutes : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'general']
Sitting there watching the sun disappear behind the palm trees while squirrels played and ducks paddled past on their way to the nearby pond while sipping an apple martini or mojito or daiquiri was divine : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Saying that it had every modern convenience you could wish for : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I highly recommend this resort for families looking to have an easy relaxing and care free break! : []
The shower was awful : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Overall we had an amazing time : [u'location', u'sea']
We booked this as a Luxury Escapes package and were well looked after by the very attentive staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There have been a few changes in the club since April when I was here last : []
I like the fresh topical fruits served daily at breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
this is the right spot : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My husband and I just stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 8 nights and found it to be very good : []
But other than these the food is not great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The breakfast is the same everyday : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The bathroom with separate toilet was huge : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
During low tides, we would move to one of the main swimming pools, which were always clean and never overcrowded (we stayed 2_9 November, this is also maybe the reason) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Recommended for a relaxing stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The grounds were beautiful, our room amazing (we were kindly upgraded!!!) and the staff were excellent : []
We tended to catch a taxi to Seminyak to eat at some amazing restaurants there : []
Breakfast was good enough and we always had it near the small lake in the garden, very peaceful : []
My husband payed $4 : []
We also ate at an Italian just outside of the Resort Gates, this was really lovely too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Free internet access plus non alcoholic drinks anytime : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I especially enjoy having dinner on the beach itself served with it's 5- star service : []
Very disappointing experience and one I would not recommend : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Staff were great and breakfast is exactly what the hungry kids wanted : [u'overall', u'culture']
We stayed in a deluxe double room which although not the biggest was adequate and clean : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The staff were gentle, happy and most helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
So a great place for a family holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Great show and food and beverages selection (prices very reasonable for a 5*****) : []
Loved the traditional Balinese style of the hotel and surroundings : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
If we get a chance to go top Bali again any time soon, I would probably try Sanur as I would like to able to walk to nearby restaurants and have easier access to trips to ubud : []
The staff was really friendly and helpful, but the again, I think this is a Balinese treat, so I guess any good hotel will serve you that : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are lots of restaurants and bars at the hotel, and all the staff everywhere are lovely, friendly and polite : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Breakfast buffets were good, though not in the Four Seasons/Ritz-Carlton league of lavishness : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
A little pricier than most bali restaurants but still very good value : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The location is conducive to rest : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We also tried to book into their spa, and found that you really needed to make a reservation 2-3 days in advance to get a suitable time, keep that in mind : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we really enjoyed the quiet areas at the spa especially the pool : []
Our room was clean and welcoming - maintained to the highest of standards : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
This is our second Luxury Escapes trip and this time we opted for the Palace Club upgrade with full board : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
To say we enjoyed our stay is an understatement : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
(The ONLY thing that marred our arrival was that the rollaway bed for our son wasn't set up, but that was minor : [u'overall', u'culture']
The manager kept saying that they didn't have a vehicle that could accommodate our family of four, with four large suitcases : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This walkway connects almost all of the Nusa Dua area hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Our kids were well look after by all the staff and enjoyed the kids club, kids pools (3 of them) and the main pool where they loved sitting at the pool bar and having mocktails : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
When I asked about jackfruit for breakfast, it appeared at the next day's breakfast : []
The staff throughout the entire complex are truly wonderful and would go out of their way to ensure everything is in order and also when help or assistance was needed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We loved the hotel and the staff couldn't do enough for us : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I would highly recommend this hotel for those wanting to steer clear of the hustle and bustle of Kuta, but still close to shopping and only 15 minute taxi ride to Kuta : []
The service by the people was so friendly : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The only thing I want to remake is the following: Air conditioning in room is VERY NOISY and the temperature is not cold for me : []
The restaurants always offered excellent quality especially Raja's traditional Indonesian : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
This took the form of a buffet ans was one of the best I've experienced : []
I do not recommend this hotel! : []
They smile and greet you wherever and whenever they see you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Breakfast was plentiful with many choices : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There are hourly activities, kids will be entertained : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The other facilities such as the gym, lap pool, kayak & winsurfer hire, internet room, games room, ATM, bank, resort shop, room service, swim-up pool bar, bike hire, taxi counter, consierge, duty managers and so on make the resort a wonderful place to stay, so much so that we will be returning in 2010 : []
We had the most amazing holiday with our two kids 3 years and 6 months : []
We had a family room with King bed and one single bunk bed in attached separate room : []
We spent our 30th wedding anniversary at the Hotel and Spa , on our arrival we were given a bouquet of flowers and a congratulations card from the hotel management , nice touch ! The rooms are pleasant, and quiet with lovely views : []
The village nearby offers cheaper options for massages as well as cheap shopping : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Good food, well priced : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel appears to cater well for varying age groups : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Afterwards you can take a great romantic walk along the beach path too to wear it off! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great location, wonderful staff, fantastic facilities - just what you'd want for a relaxing resort holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our stay at nusa dua was great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel was fantastic and the staff were charming and could not do enough to help : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Plenty activities for kids and adults, kids club with movie night to give the parents a night off : [u'overall', u'culture']
Rooms are very large, beds and pillows are top rated : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
We loved the pool, there is always available staff to take our orders, the beach is fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We did manage to catch one afternoon tea on our last day which was fabulous and I was bitterly disappointed I did not get there every day : []
We also found that out in other restaurants they were roughly $9 - $11 AUS which is pretty good as in adelaide we buy cocktails for $15 - $20 for those who can handle strong alcohol! The non alcoholic cocktails are great!! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
If there is an outdoor jacuzzi next to the pool, it would be perfect for adult over seeing their kids at the pools : []
The TV was flat screen however if it doesn't have any USB ports : []
I meani have slept on a Japanese Futon before & it was confortable but this so certainly NOT that : []
5 nights(wish it was longer) : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
If you walk just past the security for the hotel there are drivers waiting who will take you anywhere you want to go : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort is looking amazing after your upgrades and we look forward to coming back again : []
Food especially the shrimp : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We went to Jimbaran Bay for dinner one evening, very pricey for what you get, but very smokey and could not see our food as too dark on the beach tables : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We used the gym and spa facilities and they were both very well run : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Ate there twice was not disappointed : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We go yearly to Nusa Dua : []
Swimming pools lovely and clean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast dining area was located by a fabulous pond and plants : [u'location', u'general']
The Spa is a particularly attractive area especially by the pool : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
In the past we have always stayed at Seminyak, SANUR, or Kuta but this time we thought we might splash out and stay in a 5***** : []
we had to participate congress in convention center, that's why we choose this hotel : []
Comfortable rooms with a wonderful view : [u'room-experience', u'view']
Rooms in our wing were culturally elegant and quiet enough : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
its a very nice property for the price they offer it in : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Following a hectic tour of China the Nusa Dua Beach hotel was just what we needed th relax and unwind with staff who attend to your every need great hotel the spa was also very relaxing, on site restaurants were good but quite expensive : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
It was great and when we had been out for part of the evening, returning hot and tired, we grabbed our small bag from the concierge and made use of the Santi Lounge, the wonderful "departure lounge" downstairs from reception : []
We stayed at here for 10 days in April 2013 : []
The hotel staff were exceptional and always smiling and making us feel welcome : []
We just got married at Nusa Dua Beach hotel at it was picture perfect! Mrs Eka our wedding coordinator did an awesome job on the day and all the work to get it there! The gardens and staff are excellent : []
If they could do this, this hotel would and should surely be ranked higher : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Lovely pools and gorgeous beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are spacious with touches of Balanise Charm : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The rooms are well appointed and comfortable and we would recommend getting one overlooking the pool/beach area as this is the heart of the resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff is very friendly and efficient, make you feel you are at home and help you in any way they can : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The beach is kept very clean and security limit the hawkers : [u'overall', u'safety']
There was eight of us this time and we really had a wonderful time : []
Avoid walking to the old resort after dark : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
For the hotel, my one suggestion would be to offer free water with purchased meals : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you are looking for a true Balinese experience, look no further : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So if anyone wants assistance in the future contact me by my Trip Advisor name : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
The room was desperately in need of refurbishment : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Can't wait to travel to Bali again, but will bring some relatives to experience the dream-like atmosphere at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The people are very hospitable and the overall design of the hotel is breath taking as it incooperates so much of the nautral environment into it architecture : []
Everything here was PRICE + + : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
On a positive note all the staff at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa are very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Shame it was upstairs as I had really wanted to have outside garden space which was provided with our original room but it was still a better outcome all round : []
We had a luxury escapes stay : []
It would be great if a DVD player was included however the TV had a variety of Satalite channels to chose from : []
Main reasons were: the traditional Balinese architecture and fit out of the rooms , the beautiful gardens, the relaxed vibe, great pool, helpful and lovely staff (special mention to Rima at the guest relations desk who did all our restaurant bookings and was an absolute delight), great b/fasts : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Service is excellent, DEFINITELY WILL RETURN : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
overall this is a great place to be pampered and have a blast!! : [u'location', u'general']
I like that fact that it has a small veranda : []
It was then I thought I should give Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & spa a thumbs up : []
Not very clean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed in a standard room in the hotel for 6 nights and had a wonderful stay : []
I cleaned it up myself anyway : []
Also was quite disappointing that smoking was permitted in the pool area where many kids played around : [u'overall', u'culture']
We took to just using the shower head that actually worked properly so this was not too much of a problem : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As I am not a coffee drinker, I drink Diet Coke in the morning and after two days of having it at the breakfast area, on the third day a waiter told me that they didn't offer diet coke in that restaurant : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Check in and Check out was very smooth- under 5 mins : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
There are a 2-3 restaurants about ten minutes walk away (take a left from the resort and then first right) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Food wise the hotel was pretty good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel was big and there were many activities going on everyday : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The only other point I would make is that the closed off Nusa Dua and Bali Collection area is quite artificial and does not really represent Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The facilities are very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Service overall was great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
3 out of 4 rooms were beautiful, overlooking the pool and garden, whilst the other room was further from ours and was overlooking a garden (which was still nice, but not as nice as ours) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The grounds are amazing; it took us a whole day to work out where everything was (which was a good thing) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Had the chance to spend 5 days on this amazing hotel; was upgraded to the palace club room n it killed it all : []
The buffet breakfast was great, we also ate at the pizza restaurant, balinese restaurant and the beachside restaurant, and although it was quite pricey the food was fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
I think I'm gonna come back to experience more of their hospitality again and again : []
An early booking is always recommended to keep the wallet light :) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Lovely big bathrooms with nice fluffy towels & lovely toiletries : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens', u'bathrobe', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
Overall; a great experience! You are surely don't feel bored to spent a week here! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Looking forward to returning in June to see the renovations : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Fronts right on to the beach with a well maintained path for walking and cycling was excellent as was the shuttle service to the shopping area : [u'location', u'general']
We didn't give the spa 5 stars because, as a honeymoon couple, we would've preferred if we could've enjoyed the jacuzzi or sauna together rather than separately! But nevertheless, a great, clean and relaxing spa! Would definitely recommend for a honeymoon :) : []
We were very sad to say good-bye to this Hotel and its wonderful staff : []
We took a bike ride along the Nusa Dua beach track to see the other resorts and the sights : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The overall experience is rather average, the receptionist was not friendly till we were told that we got the Palace Club rooms, which had its own reception area; most of the staff there are friendly and helpful, but a bit too slow sometimes : [u'amenities', u'conference']
we stayed for six nights at the end of January in two adjoining rooms , not overly spacious but had enough storage and bathrooms great, pools are lovely with plenty of space and sunbeds ,Breakfast is great with good selection but other restaurants a bit of a disappointment with not a great choice and average quality for the cost, we used the gym and the spa pool also the early morning yoga which was a great experience, Wifi was good around the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The staff at this hotel are unbelievably helpful, every time we needed something they did everything they could to assist : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We are happy to return to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
the cars and guides provided were fanastic : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
At least you got into the palace club, where they had an really good breakfast and cocktail hour (all free) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The bed is amazingly comfortable and I considered trying to smuggle some of the pillows home in my suitcase! The pools are great, and even though the resort looked to have many rooms there was always a chair free to lay in : []
Chess restaurant was perfect for lunch, a few steps from the beach and in the evening dinner on the deck was a great experience : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We also found because Nusa Dua is a gated area you miss the culture of Bali, however it depends on what you want from your holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
n i believe there was noise of the motor scooter : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
The cultural shows were entertaining if a little (or a lot) touristy, and the accompanying food from the buffet was average - the food we had at the hotels other restaurants was better : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The restaurants are good also : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The beach was fine but narrow (and literally 10 seconds from the pools), contrary to some other reviews I've read, although we stayed on the loungers near the pool most of the time as there was more shade : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The resort spa is also beautiful with reasonably priced treatments : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
first of all the room wasnt nice and there were lots of bugs but they moved us : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Many just expect how to make you a paying client and how to serve you at the maximum charge! the hotel was clean, beautiful and memorable but except the excellent breakfast we were not so happy with the other meals : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is very clean, beautifully presented and the staff are very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Breakfasts were excellent with a great variety to suit all preferences : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Staff very friendly though some need training with billing options : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
flies at sushi section of breakfast , need to cover the food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The balcony was small : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
our room and facilities were just as we imagined for a resort hotel : []
You can get a cab out to local restaurants, and as others have mentioned, get the same good food for about half the price! We can recommend Bumbu Bali restaurant, traditional Balinese food, a short cab ride away : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There are also hawkers on the beach to sell you fishing or snokeling trips on their boats that are moored out front, or to sell you jet-ski rides : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There were nice balinese sculpture and walls (nice balinese feel) in the landscape : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Bar fridge was always fully stocked! Air conditioning was amazing! Frangapanis on the balcony were beautiful and the little squirrels were a delight to watch on the balcony and around the garden : [u'room', u'appliances']
We found all staff to be happy, friendly and most attentive, always very obliging with any requests : []
go to the spa pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Beach set up is great but I found the beach vendors persistent and annoying, always interrupting a nap to try to sell you a sarong or kite : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms were clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Overall, the room is very well equipped with all amenities : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Great relaxing trip : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We booked this resort through Luxury Escapes and upgraded to the Palace suite : []
The room had problems - first the air conditioner thermostat was busted, so one part of the room was super cold and the other was warm : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The gardens and pool areas were quite pleasant with plenty of loungers and chairs, the beach was not quite so tidy, oil patches here and there and of course the usual constant prosession of people trying to sell you their wares, this can become a bit tiresome : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Drivers can be arranged but remember to barter : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
It was our 30th wedding anniversary and we were looking for something special : []
I tried Well Being Spa in Seminyak (a local spa outside) as well at USD64 for 3 hours, it is absolutely not comparable, worth to pay more in the hotel : []
Howeever i have a special mention all the female staff were welcoming and all their service was with a smile : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The style is trulu Balinese, with sculptures everywhere you go : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Shame the weather was wet & overcast : [u'location', u'sea']
We used the hotel facilities only really during the day and traveled to Kuta or Seminyak most evenings : []
it's really so nice place to set and relax : []
We were disappointed with how dated and worn the room looked when we were escorted to it : []
You never feel on top of other guests : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms were clean and immaculate : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Even the housekeeping staff were pleasant and polite : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
People bring goods to the beach to sell each day Sarongs, jewellery etc : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The pools are very very clean and large : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
07:00 ish one of the best buffet breakfast spreads we have enjoyed anywhere in the world : []
Breakfast buffer was awesome : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Our room was on the ground floor, open the balcony door and a large patio awaits looking unto a perfected manicured lawn with several ponds full of fish : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
) Staff don't have great english, we just came from Amadea Resort in Seminyak and this place has nothing on them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I don't mind giving them a lot of tips : []
We stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for a couple of nights, late March 2010 : []
As my brother and sister stay on the ground floor : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
The buffet breakfast has many delicious selections,and the staff are very attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Great for kids with mini-pool and kids club and activities : []
Most costumes doesn't really depict a character : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
They accommodated our request and we were so happy with the rooms : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
We loved the dining ambience of the resort and felt meals were cheaper than Sydney prices! Of course, there are also local restaurants nearby so you can get the best of both worlds : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
it had Indonesian (fried rice, noodles, tofu) as well as American/European food (pastries, ham, omlettes, potatoes) : []
Though travel often gets in the way, fond memories fades away but slowly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It didn't seem as luxurious as some of the neighbouring hotels (with their big day and night beds out available to lounge on in the evenings) : []
The safe was large so you can fit any size laptop or personal items in it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was a bit embarrassing watching some people carry a few pieces of whole fruit out of the restaurant to have later - does this happen all the time? I wouldn't have dreamt of doing that : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms are beautiful just need a little TLC : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Also the spa was very expensive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thank you and all your staff for making our stay a great one, see you again : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Don't take the shuttle bus as it is a nice 15-20 minute walk : []
Our suite was good though and the senior staff did listen to our qualms and must be credited highly on acting upon them and providing us with a series of "treats" which were delightfully unexpected : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Yet, they are not aggressive or intrusive, giving the guests an atmosphere of absolute calm : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
These were so good we arranged our days around it : []
Great time, going back in August : [u'location', u'sea']
You are really limited to what you do outside the resort and surrounding areas as there is not a great deal of street shopping or dining however it is a 10 minute walk along the beach strip to The Bali Collection where there are shops and restaurants, more pricey than Kuta or Legian : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Looking forward to a return visit next year : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Beautiful gardens, landscaped public areas with ponds filled with huge carp : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The rooms look out over beautiful gardens and fountains : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Nice setting with direct access to the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Nusa Dua is a newly developed tourist area of Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
It should've been cleaner like the other hotels : []
They serve simple food with reasonable price : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The style and ambiance of the hotel is perfect - yes, there are newer, more glamorous and more luxurious resorts around, but if you want to feel like you are in Bali, then this is a great choice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool in the Spa area was very tranquil and relaxing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The hotel transport was 4 times as much! I was very disappointed by this as talking to other people staying there they were offered a reduced price when they complained : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff went the extra mile for us and regular made sure we were ok : []
If you don't want the rooms that haven't yet been revamped, then just pay the extra ($30USD/night) and upgrade to a newly renovated : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
be back next year and would highly recommend this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The Palace Club area at the NDBH is so peaceful and beautiful, away from the noise and with ducks on rolling green lawns and amid the fountains and gazebos : [u'location', u'general']
The rooms have traditional designs reflecting the elegant details of the beautiful Balinese architecture : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
luxurious resort with number of in house restaurants to choose from : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
I will treasure what you beautiful people did for me : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel and grounds are beautiful, the staff exceptionally helpful and polite, the rooms are gorgeous and the food was lush : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Standards across the board are excellent : [u'overall', u'safety']
The resort was a little dated, but was good : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Great swimming pool and beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We really enjoyed the pools and spent quite a lot of time in them : []
Got upgraded to a suite as it was my special birthday (thank-you) : []
Enjoy this Hotel for what it is : []
) for 8 : []
Games room was so far away in quiet spa area we didn't feel it was the best location : [u'location', u'sea']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is in the same strip of other hotels such as Westin, The Laguna, and Melia to the right and Club Med to the left : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Food items run out fast due to crowds during holiday season but this is no excuse for staff to be slow in replenishing the items : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great entertainment and dinner facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They were very respectful of privacy : [u'room-experience', u'privacy']
It is very well maintained and quiet : []
This type of room configuration we found was not on other websites : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The hotel has 2 large pools and a few smaller ones : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The wonderful thing is when you return youcan lick back and relax all in all Bali is beautiful the hotel is very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our only problems were our airport transfer did not arrive and we had to make our own way to the hotel and the pools are lovely but because people put their towels out on the chairs really early in the morning and reserve them for the day, its impossible to get a chair after about 8 : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Finally always check the change, because the waiters many times braught us back not the right amount of change! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This resort ticks all the boxes, fantastic facilities, beautiful surrounds, wonderful staff, great food, what else could you want : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food tip - eat at Kendi Kuning next to Club Med and visit the Bali Connection (Bebek Bengil) : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We had a week at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
It feels like the hotel has a heart and loyalty : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
the restuaraunts at the hotel are all fantastic and by western standards very good value but once you have been out of the hotels and see waht you pay blimey!!! bali can be very cheep! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The drains were smelly and noisy : [u'amenities', u'conference']
For example, TV is small, still CTR, Room's Internet didn't work well, I could not use well, it was very slow, even couldn't open web page : []
Would definately return to this hotel if we went back to Bali : []
They start with 250 $ and can end up selling it for 20 $ after wasting your time and just constantly lying to you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
When i told the taxi drive to go to nusa dua beach hotel & spa, he told me "right choice" : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We were invited to the VIP party drinks and got to meet some key staff including the GM and they are all lovely : []
Also really enjoyed the restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
My favourite is actually the smaller but still sufficiently large pool at the spa : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The night before they just had a large group staying in the hotel, so they were running out of clean room : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We had a great stay at the Nusa Dua Beach & Spa hotel : []
Hanging out at the pool and chess bar was very relaxing : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I found nice coral fish like clown fish and other nice fishes : []
After bypassing the Padma hotel this year due to ridiculous prices we decided to try Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : []
A wonderful stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The downside however, is that Nusa Dua is made first and foremost for tourists : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
My mum, sister and I spoilt ourselves to a break in the first week of December and chose to go to Bali as our escape : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
I would definitely recommend this hotel to every one, stunning !!! : []
The best thing about Nusa Dua is the beautiful gardens, orderly roads/pathways and only a few locals of the beach selling things : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is shuttle bus which runs hourly if you too tired or too hot to walk : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
From then on I had to insist for a metered taxi for transport, as the hotel staff kept pushing for us to use their transport : []
The food was great and very reasonable, yes a bit more than outside but still a great price : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Very special! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Sampled x3 of the restaurant eating sections of the hotel, all satisfactory and no complaints : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A great ecperience, I Will certainly come back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
At least no major concussion or broken bones : [u'amenities', u'patio']
It was our honeymoon and we were looking for somewhere which would make us a feel a little special : []
'Huge' is an understatement : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One thing all Nusa Dua hotels offer is the opportunity to stroll hand in hand along clean beaches, on two-person wide footpaths that are flat and well-lit at night : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Having read all of the reviews on this website before we left, I was slightly worried that the hotel may not live up to our expectations : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
My children went to kids club which they thought was boring due to stuff being a little lazy to do anything exciting with kids : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
My only issue would be the Food at two of the theme night dinners, not up to the standard we expected : []
We are currently planning our return visit to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for 2012 : []
It was very touching : []
first day I waited 1hour for help from housekeeping department : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Free WiFi around the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It's a large resort so you offer feel like you are alone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But perhaps not in Bali? The standard of hotels on the island is really phenomenal - from the most basic accomodation to 6 star hotels : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
They tried hard, but they needed professional entertainers as it was cringeworthy at times! : []
My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed a romantic dinner in the poolside gazebo : [u'overall', u'culture']
However, you could escape and walk along the beach which was always clean and had lots of beds available : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Not brand new, but in very good condition, nice and relaxing atmostphere and extreamly beautyful garde : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall it is a very good value for the money (at a five star+ resort) : [u'overall', u'culture']
Free wireless internet with reception even on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Such a shame that our luxury escape holiday started so badly and really had lost a nights sleep and then half a day in all the toing and froing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is one of the best in the Nusa Dua area with still a traditional feel compared to the international chains around : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I really trust the hotel staff! Did I mentioned that the area has a security checkpoint and the hotel has another? : []
Decided to have balinese food and decided to dine at Raja's Balinese Cuisine : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The room was of a good size and was nicely decorated, with a nice shower and decent seperate bath : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
As for the location, yes it is a wee bit away from Bali Collection, but hey a 10 minute walk along the beach front, shuttle bus from the hotel or a cheap taxi - you are never far away : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On top of this, I had left my camera unattended in the hotel and it wasn't to be found again : []
We will definitely come back again : []
The seafood restaurant is nice but pricey, especially the wine : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It's a beautiful resort with good atmosphere and services : []
It was my first trip to Bali : []
Lots of carved wood, stonework, and even an outdoor cultural theater in the center of the courtyard, featuring an almost-recreation of a Hjndu Temple : [u'overall', u'culture']
My travel agent suggested this would be ideal for her and WOW he was so correct ! Mum only left the resort once to visit the local shops : [u'overall', u'culture']
View is fantastic : [u'room-experience', u'view']
The hotel staff are welcoming, friendly and always ready to make you feel great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is not looking old and does not need updating : []
There is a bar in the middle of the pool as well if you may need a drink while swimming : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
you need not look further away from nusa dua beach hotel & spa : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nice public rooms and grounds : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff from management to bar staff and catering are all so very polite and accommodating always with a friendly smile : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
As one of the first resort in Nusa Dua, the facilities and rooms could see the age, However it is well taken care of : []
And here lies one 'sweet & sour' enigma, such wonderful staff but so much incompetence : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, there are areas where the hotel can improve : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The beach was also beautiful and good for swimming : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Certainly better than the Barong show included in some excursions : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
After some search we chose the Nusa Dua beach resort : []
We loved our 10 day stay and would definitely return for another holiday : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The guitarist in the bar was fantastic! Breakfast was also superb : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Must stay if u are looking for a relaxed holiday : []
The gardens are amazing : [u'amenities', u'garden']
I suggest this hotel everybody : []
Perhaps this time, we will try out the spa and sports activities provided : []
The gardens are lovely with fountains and every room has a balcony overlooking acres of garden : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Impressive entrance to the hotel, airy and exotic lobby, really felt as if we had moved to paradise ! Stayed for 5 nights, felt as if we had stayed for 2 weeks! We stayed in the Palace Club side of the hotel, allowing us to savor the hotel's grounds in relative peace : []
Food: the food was excellent in all restaurants & the breakfast was delicious & beyond belief, almost anything you can imagine is on offer & then some! it was my partners FAVOURITE part of each day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The shower area in the hotel room should have a door to avoid water spillage though : [u'location', u'general']
It was very clean, the staff extremely polite and the breakfast was simply amazing! Drawbacks are that all five restaurants of the hotel closed their kitchen around 10 : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
A very nice, very big 5 star resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The elegant pavilions, combined with traditional Balinese architecture and extensive grounds mean you can always find a quiet spot to relax and although the loungers by the pool are often reserved with towels by breakfast, there are plenty of loungers under shady umbrellas a minute away on the beach or by the stunning lap pool near the spa and tennis courts : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It is a great location : []
Well get up before dawn to put a towel down early or sit on the grass : [u'amenities', u'garden']
I travelled with our extended family on ten people of various ages : []
Taxis are a good option when your feet are sore but take the Bluebird taxis as they have meters : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Barong Dance: This was so much fun! Actors dressed up in beautiful costumes to put on a native show portraying the eternal fight between good and evil : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
very expensive tours i : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Everyone from the receptionist to the gardner says "hello, how are you?" and when we have called reception or room service they have responded within a couple seconds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Highly recommended! : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
On the whole, it was an excellent hotel with plenty to do from tennis to squash to volleyball etc : []
Having stayed in Sanur, Kuta South and Legian on previous visits, we very much appreciated the tranquil environment offered in Nusa Dua : []
Overall we were happy - I can be a grumpy traveller, and with the hotel being a large component of the cost of the holiday, I expect a lot : []
The staff is very helpful and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We really appreciate this : []
They just have to do one small change & that is to their pool which looks slightly outdated : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Clean and well serviced daily : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Early morning we would have our tea with some other guests like squirrels , sparrows and a few other birds : []
Really enjoyed our holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The spa was really nice, but treatments a bit expensive : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
There were hardly any local Indonesian items : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Our 1yo baby was well looked accommodated and the staff were very helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
beware of the bats! : [u'location', u'forest']
Go elsewhere : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Breakfast is great : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Wonderful breakfast ,afternoon tea and cocktails with hors d'oeuvres provided in a really picturesque and peaceful setting : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The hotel and its grounds are truly beautiful and the pool is great too : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
March is a great time to go : [u'location', u'sea']
The facilities are excellent and especially good for children : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They were nice, but not really "Bali" : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The food at the resort was great we made it to the Bali Show night as well as the Seafood BBQ : []
The beach and gardens were gorgeous : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
beautiful garden with the sea view,lovely beach : [u'room-experience', u'view']
As far as the leading hotels of the world tag goes, I am not quite sure what this means and who awards it, but if you take it literally you may be disappointed, a discerning traveler, used to staying at the worlds finest, will probably find that this does not quite compare : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We recently stayed at the hotel for a family holiday with two young children under 3 years of age : [u'overall', u'culture']
Cannot fault this hotel, there are renovation works being carried out but they did not interfere with our stay at all, in fact they were so discrete we only found out about them whilst going for a walk one morning : []
This year we return to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our 19th anniversary : []
Our room was fine although others in our party had rooms that were extremely small and disappointing for the money paid : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Surely it is one of the best in Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The room was good with a nice balcony (standard here) with a look on the garden full of birds and nice squirrels : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I ate dinner at a couple of the restaurants both were well patronized and I found the quality of the food excellent - again the staff made both dinners memorable : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The grounds are superb and so well maintained : [u'overall', u'safety']
Our daughter was married there 4 years ago , and what an event that was : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
When we first step foot into the resort, we felt as if we had been transported to another world : []
It was a long, long way! And when you end up in a place like Nusa Dua, it's almost perfect : []
Overall, we found a good variety of food choices, but our favorite meal of the day was the breakfast buffet : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Basically we found the staff to either not understand the deal or make to difficult for us to use it : []
There are quite a few restaurants within the hotel which are all well priced, clean and the service is outstanding : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We have just returned from the Nusa Dua beach hotel and spa and we are already planning our return trip next year : []
All in all, the Nusa Beach Hotel is lovely, a traditional building in idyllic surrounds on a beautiful beach with the most wonderfully friendly staff and some great food : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
But dont be seduced by stating in the hotel as there is so much to see and do in Bali you have to get out and see it : []
Recommend this hotel for families with children, maybe something little more upmarket for a romantic couple getaway : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I had before stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort in March when I attended a nearby conference and enjoyed the pools, rooms and laid back and friendly service although there was definite room for improvement : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Beauty at every turn, from the magnificent Balinese palace style design to the decor, room interiors, divine gardens, pools, restaurants and beachfront to the smilingly helpful staff who made our stay so beautiful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Although the restaurants are a bit expensive, the food is great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
From the moment I arrived the staff were some of the friendliest I had ever met : []
The room was a deluxe with a king size bed and a nice bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
EVERY hotel I have stayed at in the last 2 years (including lesser hotels in 'money grabbing' Russia) have offered free Wi-fi : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Large quantities of delicicious, fresh and just-ripe fruit, fruit juices, assorted bread rolls, and cooked options including pork bacon, sausages and eggs cooked to order : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
its walking distance from the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I truly recommend this hidden beauty to everyone who plan to stay in Nusa Dua, and cannot wait to be back again on the next trip : [u'amenities', u'patio']
would recommend this resort and the palace club rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Staff amazing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
delicious and a lot of variety : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
54 people travelled from Ireland, USA and Australia for the same reason : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The location is amazing and the service of the hotel staff is awesome! We booked a club palace room and the room had a lot of advantages of its own : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We were so glad we did : []
pools are fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The Palace Club staff are just amazing and truly professiona, without being stiff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Nusa Dua is nice, but if you're expecting to do watersports, most the interesting stuff is 4km down the road from these hotels : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Our first room wasn't quite what we expected and was located among the renovations that were going on so there was a smell of lacquer and dust : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
Comfortable lounge with books and DVD's that you can borrow : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff extremely helpful and not pushy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Another is a deeper, bigger pool with the swim-up-bar and the other is a secret long pool down near the spas : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Nine times we have holidayed in Bali, our first time to Nusa Dua Beach Resort and it has been exceptional : []
But so are all hotels, so wasn't any surprise to us : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
However, if you're looking to travel to the Kuta and Ubud area often, note that the daily taxi rides will probably burn a substantial hole in your pocket after a while : [u'room', u'clothing', u'bathrobe']
The patio area has two comfortable sunloungers looking onto immaculate quiet gardens : [u'location', u'general']
I didn't hear a negative comment : []
We hope to return there again one day soon : []
the amenities they provide are soaps shampoo conditioner shower gel bath salts comb emery board cotton buds sewing kit toothbrush and paste shaving cream and razor tissues iron and ironing board the beach is close the pool boys watch when you hold up a green fla they come to your sunbed and bring food or drinks to you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The breakfast area was gorgeous too with the lovely sound of slowly flowing water, fishes swimming around in the pond, greenery all around : [u'location', u'general']
Following that short and painless process we were taken to our Palace Club room just another short distance away : []
We woke the next morning and made the decision that none of us were happy here and we rang Kumala Pantai to see if our room was still available : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We got the impression the Management have lost interest in the Hotel, it just needs its spark back, but in saying that we will return to this hotel : []
Thank you for a memorable holiday and making it special for our honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
I found these to be cheaper than the ones in more touristy areas of Ubud : []
Breakfast is the usual buffet and while it doesn't vary greatly, there are ample choices : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
My highlights were the beautiful spa and its private pool area, 2 hour cooking class with the head chef of 20 years, the traditional dance show in the hotels theatre and the fabulous cocktails in the lobby bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Also for children this hotel is worth visiting : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The had the knack of having fruit that was always unripe : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast is just a feast of many flavours, endless, but dangerous, slow down, dont go crazy and overeat, or you will regret : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
More quiet and better music required in the massage rooms and the ambiance can be improved : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
Overall I had a pleasant stay just hope it dont rain to enjoy their beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Great service and great value : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
some front office staff could improve their knowledge base and willingness to assist and breakfast staff could be either more attentive or more abundant : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Has an amazing charm to it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My wife had a mild illness,but the reception took her to the hotel doctor who gave her medications,which were successful,later that day we received a bouquet of flowers in our room wishing her well : []
You vil never find a better place to stayed in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We enjoyed the baby turtle release and the hotel is to be commended for its turtle work, some more green efforts would be removing plastic water bottles from sale and using only glass : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Loved the pool areas, spa treatments, amazing gardens and very helpful friendly staff : [u'location', u'general']
The location is excellent, the facilities very good, gardens immaculate and the staff very friendly and helpful : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Some selfish people tended to leave their towels on loungers in the shade for hours without returning - our advice : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The positive thing here is that there are not too many guests in the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
All the F&B facilities provided excellent value for money along with wonderful food and friendly attentive service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Cons: I m beach person but the beach of nusa dua strip was not of high standard : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It comprised a slice of cold aubergine, a slice of cold tomato topped with a little lukewarm cheese : []
We have just returned from a 16 day stay in this resort : []
I will definitely recommend this place to everyone whether you are going with family, friends or as a couple : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The thing that I like about Nusa Dua is it allows you stay in a location away from the hustle, bustle and touting that is Kuta and (to an extent) Sanur : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thankyou for a lovely stay :) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A playground was a plus for us who bring children : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Architecturally it us the only true Balinese hotel in this region : [u'location', u'general']
Lovely flowers waiting in our room for our anniversary : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We took advantage of the Luxury Escapes deal for this hotel which included all meals, $150USD credit, massages and super late check out : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Location perfect, hotel and staff perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
-The huge main pool area has a bar and stools to sit at the bar while still in the water; Pool towels provided : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens', u'bathrobe', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
The pool was quiet and shady and the activities and balls they had made it not boring : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The staff were exceptional, the swimming pools were divine : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
It was lovely : []
the entrance lobby is overwhelming as it's open and lush and elegant : []
Also do not get a taxi from the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Our supposed package and fast track deal got us no favours other than a man meeting us as we got off the plane and showing us to the line : []
Surprisingly, every staff member here has a smile on their face which is very unlikely of the hotels in other parts of the world : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Would happily stay here again! It's only a short taxi ride to Kuta if you are after the night life and the beaches are clean and white : [u'amenities', u'patio']
But , we find out everything was safe, We always remember this matter,It was happen with two room, really appreciated all his attention : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
If you walk around the point there is a lovely beach with no buildings and a bit of surf, we didn't check it out properly but it looked great and hardly anyone there : []
The staff were extremley curtious and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
the scones were to die for and the cocktails in the evening with hors'dourves were perfect : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
There seems to be a lot of staff but not everyone seems to know what they are supposed to be doing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But otherwise our seven days staying in Nusa Dua beach hotel was very satisfying : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This was our 5th trip to Bali but our first at your facility : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Sports center with many items, even some exercises course : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The breakfast was really good, you'll be spoiled for choices : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I split my stay in bali to 2 hotels; this being the latter, and as it turns out, entirely better in comparison : []
Buy some nuts from the local shop for the squirrels! : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Breakfast was the usual choices but again not exceptional : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Nothing was too much trouble for the staff to organise : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
When confronted with this they apologized and discounted it : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We had a rough start to our trip seeing as the shuttle we booked from the airport to the hotel was infested with ants which climbed all over us and got into all our bags : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The service was poor, especially around the pool, where the staff have limited English : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Our room was deluxe room with pool view as requested via internet booking : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Please make sure you have an international drivers license) This gave use the use of the best Hotel in Nusa Dua and the freedom to do whatever we pleased : []
This hotel is now completing big renovations which are hardly creating any inconvenience to guests as the hotel has 3 wings and they are spread far apart : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The pools were great - warm and well kept : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
It was a basic class, but it felt great to stretch after travelling : []
No issues with mosquitoes : [u'location', u'forest']
The whole resort was spotless : [u'amenities', u'pool']
There is an amazing gym,tennis courts etc : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Breakfast was not bad with great varieties and they did change part of the menus daily too : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
In the evening between 6 and 8pm there were free cocktails and premium alcoholic drinks, soft drinks and fruit cocktails were also available : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Get breakfast included in your room rate as they are great and will keep you going all day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I once experienced a dine course in Raja's Balinese Cuisine, and they offer so many authentic Balinese cuisine, what I loved most is the cutleries and the plate, they were so big so grandeur, ah felt like a royalty : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
it was like a dream in paradise : []
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone : []
No one ever said No for anything : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I stay there for 2 days only and unable to explore all facilities yet hence i fell in general are good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Staff were helpful and friendly and the buffet breakfast was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
When I stayed here in 2005 I was highly impressed, less so the time : []
Breakfast was really good though : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I came for one night and had to stay for two it was such a wonderful experience : []
) Bathrooms are so small, you smash your elbows when you try to wipe your bum : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One towel per guest can be considered somewhat poor for "one of the Leading hotels of the world" : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
We weren't too keen on the stallholders on site who were a bit too enthusiastic in their sale's pitch : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We're already looking forward to our next trip, and are sure we would prefer Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa above the many American hotel chains : []
We loved the food and cocktails : []
good options of Massages on the Beach and water sports : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
I think what made our trip though aside from all of the above was the other guests in the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We tried snorkelling in Nusa Dua beach with hawkers in the beach : []
The beach is big and clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
As noted by another reviewer the pools were very warm and not refreshing but the ocean was handy and cooler and clean : [u'location', u'sea']
Many people we met return to the hotel every year, such is its magic : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
and he had to work hard to pull me inside the boat:))) : []
Had a great time in Nusa Dua with the family : [u'location', u'sea']
This is our second trip to Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All in all, I would stay there again : []
We found ourselves discovering and enjoying a different part of the resort and its restaurants each day : []
Food was delicious and we only ate at the restaurants on the grounds : []
Breakfast buffet was excellent but getting a table is a little difficult if you go late for breakfast : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Sure, food is expensive, but you expect that at such a hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would happily return : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You will meet a bit of resistance, initially, but insist : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The gardens are amazing, the beach perfect and so nice and clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
If you are a runner: Bali is HOT : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Apart from Dewi at the Loung Bar (who was really nice with great interaction skills), Rina (customer relations) and Warna (housekeeping) I can't think of any one else to mention as being stand outs : []
Stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 4 nights in February 2013 with my husband and 3 teenage children : [u'overall', u'culture']
What I loved the most were the trio of singers that visit the restaurant along the beach every night : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We went for a relaxing holiday as we had just done a tour of New Zealand and wanted a rest on our way home to England, we stayed 9 nights and wished it was much longer : []
Beautiful beach, 2 very big pools and quite a few restaurants onsite : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Didn't actually try any of these as we like to eat out, but they all looked very nice : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The water levels are too shallow even on a high tide its waist deep and full of seaweed : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Our room was large, comfortable and air conditioned : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
It even has its own lap pool with lounge chairs : []
For English speakers, your limited to news channels and a few movie channels : [u'amenities', u'internet']
It is definitely worth paying the extra for a Palace Club room : []
After all our efforts to get a quiet room, we could still hear the construction site : []
Overall a solid 8/10 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
His real name is Wayan but as you will see there are a few so ask for John : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
They have 'real' coffee in both Areas - at the Buffett you have to make it yourself at the excellent espresso dispenser but oh to have a good latte in Bali was a god-send! : []
the rooms are spacious and clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The drinks were over $10 for a large Bintang compared to around $3 outside the hotel - some mark up is expected but this was just too much : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- add N/A as answer option to the questions : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
Breakfast was good average but the service not really good no choices for vegetarian : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Nothing was a trouble and we were always greeted with a smile : []
There are lot of greater places on Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had garden view and every morning the squirrels would come and play on our balcony : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Kid friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- free wifi in the lobby works well : [u'amenities', u'internet']
I wanted to take their bed home with me, the best night's sleep ever : []
This place did well to live up to my expectations, we'll definitely be back : []
The Chess bar is a lovely place to sit and watch the world go by : [u'overall', u'culture']
Our only complaint, also shared by many other guests, was the remodeled shower : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The various swimming pools were large with ample space and the hotel was right on the beach it was a wonderful experience to stay at the Nusa Dua Beach & Spa Hotel : []
Jan 2012, we only stayed 2 nights here and then stayed at a couple of other resorts, from the moment we arrived right through until we left this place was gorgeous : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Having a week stayed in here! A traditional property room designed comes with modern F & B outlets by the pool or beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is no need to leave the resort with all its resturants, but we did visit the local Bali Collection shopping centre for a look around and buy souveniers for the grandchildren : []
Very nice hotel with beautiful facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This is my first trip overseas so for a newbie you can understand why i was on edge : []
After that commotion broke up, we had to spend the next one hour shifting rooms in the middle of the night! : []
Internet is a fact of life and certainly available in Bali, as we had excellent service in our other hotel : []
I ate twice at the hotel : []
The breakfast was exactly the same each day : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Also for dinner, many restaurant from " Bali Collection" place( where you can go with a free shuttle bus) are nice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Be warned though, you will be : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We made the booking through "Luxury Escapes" : []
The grounds were beautiful and well maintained and the pool and the beach are clean and quite : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The owner drove us back to the Hotel free of charge : []
Room service was excellent as was the hotel restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The rooms were basic but comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The rooms are neat and comfortable with ample space and a mini-bar : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The staff in the Palace Club lounge are wonderful - very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
away from the hustle and bustle of the city! : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'bike-ride']
quiet area, walking distance to shops and restaurants although plenty to choose from within resort, : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The Buffett breakfast were fantastic and the staff were very friendly and efficient : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I have travelled extensively around South East Asia a few years ago : []
The rooms haven't been renovated for some time and are quite old with lots of dark wood, making them dark and dreary : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
we had booked a standard room which was lovely and more than adequate, however as it was a special occasion we enquired about an upgrade and after looking at a few rooms, we upgraded to a palace room for $20 a night : []
Only expecting to get what we paid for : []
We waited for over 30 minutes for our drinks on the first night, and asked for them 3 times : []
The hotel Spa is a paradise in it self, the pool is visually striking and with massages, steam, sauna and Jacuzzi facilities complimenting the many activities Bali has to offer : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The deluxe room was well appointed and luxurious : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We will not have any hesitation in recommending this hotel to our friends : []
The hotel didn't disappoint : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Beaches, pools and restaurants were all fantastic!! Thank you For being the only place in Bali where we could order duck without a 24 hour pre-order! Palace club breakfasts were delicious! We were a bit disappointed that we were not made aware of the dress codes for the early evening cocktails before our arrival! Although I guess we could have gone shopping and purchased something appropriate we were kinda over the shopping bit after 12 days and were just wanting to relax, so unfortunately we missed out on this part of our package : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The ladies that ran it were lovely and the fact that she could come and go as she pleased while we were sat at the pool worked well for all of us : []
Michele From Italy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
we also ate at Raja's which was one of our fave meals and we ate at the chess bar : []
The hotel has 23 acres of space around it but still lacks atmosphere : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We got there, but as there was only one other girl there, the ladies explained that there would be no baking class as that would only happen if there were more than 5 kids there : [u'overall', u'culture']
If only all of the staff were as well versed in English this resort would be a true winner : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We also thought the prices of food & drink were extremely good value for money : []
We were so relaxed throughout the stay, that we did not want to leave : []
In overall we enjoyed our stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : []
The next day i had another massarge the concentrated on the feet and legs before moving up the body right till the hair got a coconut treatment we then top off with shower then flower bath : []
You get your breakfast in a separate area in such a a peaceful and beautiful setting and you will also get evening drinks and nibbles included in your price : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I felt very safe the entire time! : []
the breakfast in the morning was my favourite : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The spa is beautiful and decadent : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
All the facilities in the hotel were first class, wonderful pools, one with 24 hour access : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I visited the spa on five occasions, as much for the treatments as for the ambiance : []
A sun lounge beside the pool does need to be nabbed earlyish but there are lots of shaded lounges just a few metres away on the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You can take long walks along the beach which extends into neighbouring properties where you can go for dinner too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This time booked with the Hotel direct on an 8 night Palace Club room that included Spa treatments, Dinners and F&B vouchers : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In short they are running this hotel on the cheap and overcharging for every single bit of extra service not included in the standard package : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I would suggest maybe having a menu A & B for people staying longer and some variety from one week to the next, esp on the kids menu : []
The wired internet works fine and they provide a cable : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Internet is expensive which in this day and age is a down side : [u'amenities', u'conference']
My husband spoke to the Palace Lounge staff and we ended up with a Palace Suite on the other side of the hotel : []
If you do stay here, make sure to go to Tropical and Bumbu Bali restaurants, which are located outside of the hotel complexes : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel also has a Spa complext attached to the hotel where there are tennis courts (2), squash courts(2), gym, lap pool, saunas and all other beauty therapies and massage : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The beach was beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Just make sure that, if you come to Bali, you don't spend all your time just in Nusa Dua -- spend more of your time in Ubud! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was very nice, clean and comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We spent two weeks at the NSBH and simply loved it! : []
Nusa Dua was a fantastic place for a relaxing escape : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Nusa Dua beach hotel was amazing! Stayed here for our 1 year anniversary and loved it : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
In this day and age, free wifi in hotels is as much an essential as hot and cold water- I can't remember the last hotel that I stayed in that didn't offer it, yet the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa only offers free wifi in public areas such as the lobby and restaurants; I wasn't able to get a good enough signal on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We thought the hotel could do with a little upgrading considering the price : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The resort grounds are beautifully landscaped and contain several gorgeous pools, 3 of which are child friendly : []
The breakfast is so so : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Breakfast each morning in club was best : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
They made many calls for me a and spent a lot of time with me, which I truly appreciated : []
Staff were friendly and attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
very lovely : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
will definitely be back as they made our stay just a wonderful experience :) : [u'overall', u'feel']
The nightly rate was reasonable for a full service resort on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The resort itself is huge and has lots of places to hang out and enjoy a drink or relax : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Definitely feels like a 5 star hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
5 hour spa treatment in our our spa villa, to the night in the Royal Residence ( where we carried on our wedding reception till 3 : []
Stayed last trip at kuta side and couldn't swim at beach due to an unbelievable amount of garbage in ocean and on beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The Hotel and staff were amazing I would highly recomend anyone to stay at this hotel, the location suited us as you do not get harased in Nisa Dua,and the rooms were exactly as the looked on line, as weel as clean and very comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Close enough to the airport and a short drive to Kuta in case you're interetsted in drunk crowds and hawkers : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A couple of Bali huts away from the pools which can be hired for 1/2 or 1 day which we did once and thoroughly enjoyed : []
Every day they had some aqua aerobics you could join in with if you wished : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But we hope we will be back again! : []
Wifi is available only in the common areas, not in the rooms, but if you have a room at the ground floor and step out in the garden, then you connect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, the rooms (superior) were average (I would say three star hotel) : []
A lot more Europeans than the last time I was in Bali but I guess it added to the atmosphere of being away on holidays : []
The pool and beach were very popular with couples and families alike : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
There are a number of restaurants to dine at with mediocre food and service : [u'location', u'sea']
Also the facilities are very good (restaurants, Swiming pools and, of course) the paradisiac and very well cared beas) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
We had a very big room, with a small balcony looking in to tropical trees : []
The beach area was simply gorgeous and the shopping area called "Bali Collection" which was full of shops and restaurants was a quick free luxury bus trip up the road or a good 15 min walk - the bus worked well for us : [u'location', u'airport', u'station']
We had heard that Nusa Dua is much more expensive and upmarket : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Overall this hotel needs to pick up their game and I question the reviews Im reading on here and why there is no mention of the works going on : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Usual facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is in a great location, the staff were fantastic and the food was better than other 5 star resorts along the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The resort is lovely, very traditional but HUGE! Our Rooms were nice and clean- a little far from the pool but that's only cause the the resort is so big : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Good kids pool too! Double check your final bill as we had expenses on there that were not ours and when sorting this out a man overheard us and told us the same thing happened to him : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Good variety of activities and pools : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff were all lovely, approachable and respectful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Very few rooms here have a proper pool or a sea view : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The food was wonderful, with the breakfast buffet starting each day with so many choices we wanted to eat all day, the Chess bar furnishing drinks and snacks and wonderful service, and the different restaurants giving us a choice of evening dining : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Sometimes with friends and kids, sometimes as a couple : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The architecture of this hotel and the gardens, the dress of the staff all scream BALI : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Absolutely amazing service and resort has everything we wanted for our stay : []
there are lots of clubs 2 visit once night fallsss too for the : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My sister nearly fell over as she stepped into a hole in the paving near our rooms : [u'overall', u'culture']
Breakfasts are amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
this resort is truly accessible was there supporting my friend who is in a wheelchair : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The staff were very friendly & helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
They also didn't stick to the kids club schedule so don't be so sure your kids will have fun : [u'overall', u'culture']
The shuttle bus is free and handy to visit the Bali collection shopping mall just down the road which has many branded shops along with a good selection of restaurants to cater for all tastes : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We chose to stay in a Palace Room : []
The beach is lovely, but you can't really swim unless you like a lot of seaweed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
After two days we decided to have all meals in other hotels and outside restaurants : []
they have many swimming pools, was particularly amazed by the sandy pool : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Overall it was a great holiday with the staff and service being excellent : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Everything we would expect from a resort of this standard and could not find any faults with any aspect : []
We had breakfast on the Club lounge occassionally and experienced a very attentive service from all staff and freshly cooked to order breakfast : []
The hotel was okey : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Once I came back from a dinner, the hotel's staff had changed the bed cover : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had a ground floor ,refurbished Deluxe room in the Garden Wing and it was great to be able to sit amongst the lovely well maintained grounds and watch the squirrlels play : [u'overall', u'safety']
At this level of hotel you should get more privacy and protection from the elements : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We're so dissapointed that we took her advice as we could have easily spent a full week here rather than the 4 nights that we had : []
On our first day, we went to Ubud Village Life tour, it is simply amazing! We will definitely do it again : []
All our our money, jewellery and passports were there : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Unfortunately however, our stay did not start well : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Electric hammers are so loud and there are some beautiful hotels next door with tranquil settings : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
This property is very old now and even the refurbished rooms feel dated and shabby : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Location is in a secure estate style area full of other resorts : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
It was nice to be there, we had a good time but won't go back to this resort unless it's given a complete makeover : []
This hotel has a greatest garden I have ever seen in my life , like a paradise : []
The room had a double bed and a pair of bunks - pretty close quarters for a family of four, but still better than two rooms when you have young kids : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food was good and cocktail hour fantastic! Excellent value for money! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Rooms renovated with new furniture, large baclonies, DVD player, fridge, kitchen : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
This is NOT a complaint, but as there was a big container of lovely iced chocolate, I would have loved the same of iced coffee - that would have been delicious : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
lovely place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I had two amazing massages : []
Staff: Front desk staff are very good and were helpful, i : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Given that we were vegetarians and wanted Indian food, the Front Desk Manager made arrangements with the Chef to cook us some special items, and also followed up to see whether we enjoyed our food! The freindliness and pleasant disposition of the Balinese people in general want us to come to Bali again! : []
On the First day we wanted to go to a few places in Ubud : []
Just got back yesterday from our first trip to Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Squirrels playing in the trees, the Asian ducks running around the lake and coming up for their breakfast and the majestic white crane stalking fish in the lake, took the senses to that place we came for : []
If you were to choose just one, I would choose the Friday night beach party which is held down by the beach and includes a range of seafood, meats of all kind, salads and a huge range of desserts : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It has more of these things than the other hotels : []
Kudos to them for a great service and making our stay so memorable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
S and were welcomed by many very friendly and polite staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There was something for everyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very good beach, service, shows and the complex is really fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We had a family holiday here in April 2015 : []
The hotel restaurants served expensive international food : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
This made a very unpleasant experience as we were constantly trying to work out what we were entitled to : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room itself was impressive and clean with nice traditional decorations : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only thing which was a bit inconvenient was the fact other restaurants were a little bit futher from the hotel so if you decide to eat at the hotel it is a bit more expensive(but then this is Nusa Dua-bit more upmarket) It was very quiet compared to Legian/Kuta but then that was the reason we stayed there before going to stay at Legian : []
Boutique shops nice but way more expensive than outside : [u'location', u'general']
The gardens ans surroundings were just beautiful : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
No complaints at all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
com, the price difference is $100US per night yet when I enquired and offered to pay for an upgrade they wanted an extra $285US per night : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I guess the stay was okay, but just not up to the promises made : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Simple flavours but they got it spot on : []
However, we didn't quite enjoy the breakfast : []
The gym is well equipped and the tennis courts were available for a small fee (you can even pay for a partner if your spouse is busy sunbathing!) : [u'overall', u'culture']
Resturants were well priced and the meals all tasty : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The landscape- gardens and flora are simply fantastic : [u'amenities', u'garden']
It's recently renovated, the landscaping is beautiful and the squirrels funny : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The breakfast its very busy, this could be improved : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
On the evening we went down to the club for cocktails but there were no seats outside so we sat inside, I know they were busy but after 10 minutes I went and asked a waiter to get us a drink : []
Bali ~ Island of thousand Temple Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa located outside city area which need to pass through 2 security check point to ensure tourist had a safe stay at Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
if you are looking for something that bit more special then go to this hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beach is coral lined thus limited for swimming unlike Seminyak : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The Hotel is now under the ' Summit ' brand and there seemed to be a vast improvement in customer service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Some of the other hotels looked more expensive and perfect but they were also much more crammed together, the grounds of the Nusa Dua Beach are larger with more grass and trees than cement and buildings, also lots of squirrels which the kids loved feeding : [u'overall', u'culture']
Beds are very comfortable and cushions are made out of the best material : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
My family has been a repeated guest at NDB Hotel fo 16 years ! : [u'overall', u'culture']
We got the Palace Club Room and had fantastic benefits - private check-in, our own place to have breakfast and more importantly, a spacious room! The grounds of the hotel was beautiful just to walk about and the private beach was definitely a plus point! Would definitely go back! : []
While we really loved the hotel and the grounds : []
We spend 2 week at the Bali & see all the beaches & area : []
Our room opened onto our own private patio area where there were two sunbeds for relaxing on if you so wished to do : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are quite a lot of hawkers who pounce as soon as you set foot out of the hotel grounds- sarongs, watches etc : [u'overall', u'safety']
But the most annoying thing about the place was that there was no WiFi in the hotel rooms which is incredible considering how many people use iPads or similar : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This visit was arranged as part of a package together with a cruise : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
There was a lot of yelling from the shore, but no help! We had to allow ourselves to be washed up against the rocky breakwater and then climb out : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food was limited only when you ordered & towards the end of our stay a seperate menu was produced making us feel inferior, the drinks were portrayed incorrectly & not honoured as portrayed in the passport book : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']

The sunrises were great over the Island of Lombok and the staff were friendly and very helpful : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Afternoon tea is again a nice touch, but cocktail time could be done better : [u'location', u'sea']
So I would recommend staying at the Hotel but just be warned that food & drinks are more expensive than what they are in Australia : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The air conditioning does switch down to low when you open the door to the balcony but that is fair enough and explained when you are escorted to your room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We will : []
Great spa : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pools work well, a smaller pool that contains a volleyball net and has a sandy entrance is a good middle-ground, whilst next to that is a small kid safe pool with a basketball hoop : [u'location', u'sea']
Well mantained with an absolutely awesome pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']

But the beach facilities were great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
All other stuffs are pretty standard, neither praise nor complaints : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Very few kids (four on both occasions), the room was a bit dark and depressing (although very well stocked with toys etc), seemed to be no sign of the advertised activities going on, and on both occasions when I went to pick up the kids they were sitting watching TV : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Prices are expensive compared to outside however reasonable compared to western standards : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

Didn't try anything else - we preferred driving into Seminyak : []
We experienced lots of the "real" Bali by taking tours and bought lots of local crafts from little villages rather than gift shops : []

This was our first trip to Bali and spent 3 days at Nusa Dua and 3 days at Seminyak : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

I'm seventeen years old (female) and this hotel is fit for all ages , I would like to start off with the fitness centre although many of you come for relaxation if you are coming with your children in the centre it has a variety of activities such as : tennis , squash , bicycles , gym ,spa and a swimming pool etc - The staff in this centre are incredible , in the gym I had a staff member personally train me and motivate and encourage me to keep going , also before you go into the gym they show you how each machine works : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is nice and clean (cleared by hotel staff every morning), there was some seaweed, but what do you expect, that is the Indian Ocean! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
From our airport transfers through to room service, service was always fast and always efficient : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
if you are looking for a vacation with a resort-like atmosphere and service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Cons: Expensive to eat inside the hotel, but you will have no choice as there is no restaurants nearby , Have to take a taxi to go out or walk 20 -30 min : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a bad experience at the Mother Temple in Baisakh where we were harassed by touts : [u'overall', u'culture']

The staff are amazing especially in the palace club : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']

Although it still needs to be renovated but it's very comfortable : []
We arrived at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our last night in Bali after 4 nights in a pool villa in Seminyak which, whilst OK, was not what we had expected due to a major stuff up by Villas Indonesia Properties, who were supposed to book us into the new Nusa Dua Boutique Villa Resort : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The staff,the hotel and the location with that Balinese feel to it : []
We had stayed in this hotel in February with a luxury escapes deal and it was very cost effective and the hotel was amazing, so decided to stay for my birthday in August and again had a wonderful time : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We dried things on the balcony! The breakfast buffet was to die for : []
There is no wifi in the room but there is a high speed wired internet connection : [u'overall', u'culture']
The Construction Work really did ruin the ambience and relaxed environment - who wants to listen to that every day by the pool !? : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
All around in the gardens there were tame squirrels, they took food from your hand! Nice, clean beach : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Even though the hotel offers many restaurants we decided to venture out, plus the food was slightly over priced in the hotel area and we wanted to see the local area anyway : []
Specially the staff the the customer service desk deserve appreciation : [u'room', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'conference', u'elevator', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk', u'post-room', u'checkout']
All the staff were friendly and helpful and each day our room was made in the morning while we were out : []
I was in Indonesia for some business purpose, my stay was arranged at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
Also used the gym with plenty of equipment, there are also squash courts, pool tables, tennis courts, you wont be disappointed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Service was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast staff wonderful but day staff in restaurants did not have the same welcoming atmosphere : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I would choose this hotel again as it has Balinese culture architecture and the setting is beautiful the moment you enter the resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They are building a new restaurant on the beach front over the next 6 months of the off season but it was little noise and did not worry us : []
The beach and pools are good, thre's a spa and range of restaurants and the rooms are small but well appointed : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The food is average as is the service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
When I asked the front desk about a move because of the noise, and mentioned my "upgrade' was less than the 'standard' room of my friend, I was disappointed at the attitude of the staff : []
We would definitely stay here again : []
Love the setting of the hotel, the lush gardens + sandy beaches + several pools : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Bathroom large and great double walk in shower area : [u'location', u'general']
The Bali Collection is a very short shuttle bus trip away but far better to walk off the food with a 10-15 minute walk back to the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The main pool is great, although too warm - on really hot days it was a bit like a huge bath (personal opinion though) - not reall very refreshing : []
the beach is perfect and clean with a beach bar : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
And don't get me started on having to pay for wi-fi in your room: outrageous! Also, don't bother trying to send postcards via the little store in the hotel - it took six weeks before the even bothered sending them out! : []
The wildlife at the Hotel and care taken by staff to feed and look after them was great to see, especially the turtle who came up to lay her eggs beside our table at the Restaurant on our last night, much to the delight of our grandchildren : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who has the budget for it, wants to relax and not be bothered by 1000's of people : [u'amenities', u'patio']
i stayed here from the 1st to the 11th of october and i can confidently say if ther are any reviews saying anything other than its fantastic i would be baffled ? : []
The service at the Nusa Dua is second to none - staying in the Palace apartments was a fantastic choice and made the holiday even more special : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Second, the resort itself is very comfortable, extremely clean (staff constantly working to keep it clean) and the ambience is very relaxing : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We left deciding to return next year also - mainly due to how relaxed we feel when we leave - I have never slept so well anywhere else!! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
If you decide to go out of the hotel there is Nusa Dua and Tanjung Benoa villages within 10 minutes walk : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'bike-ride']
About a 20 minute drive to/from airport depending on traffic : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']

With the sea view around : [u'room-experience', u'view']

It was very convenient that there is a clinic at the hotel which meant he could have his blood drawn there and the results were ready within a couple of hours : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
What they call Bali collection is about 1 km away from the hotel : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
well maintained and upto standards!!! : [u'overall', u'safety']
The following morning I went to the front desk to raise this issue again : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This is not Bali, but only tourist abroad residence : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We spend the whole stay enjoying the beautiful atmosphere around the area : []
We did the Uluwatu temple, but i would not go at sunset : []
From our experience, and from reading other reviews, I think the key is to book a 'Palace Club' room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Highly recommend this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
It's absolutely spotless, the staff are super friendly, the food is great (not amazing but great) and well you pretty much get what you would expect for the price you will probably pay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel and would happily recommend to friends : [u'overall', u'culture']
My wife and I had a wonderful enjoyable and relaxing holiday : [u'overall', u'culture']
I had a Balinese massage at one of the parlours there, it was $15 US for one hour, amazing, and a lot cheaper than the hotel : []
It is no surprise that we met with lots of people coming back, again and again, some as long as 26 years over : []
We used the hotel taxi to go into Kuta/ Seminyak : []
The room has a standard safe and mini-bar, iron and ironing-board & is air conditioned : []
Good convenient shuttle to Bali Connection, small shopping mall : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Although in saying this when we stayed we paid $150 AUD per night for a deluxe room which is now around $236 per night : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Nusa dua property is amazing specially the location and beach view restaurant : [u'room', u'furniture']
Day trips are organised on the guests behalf : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
The accommodations were superb, although at times, we felt the room could have been a bit cooler, particularly during our sleep time : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Really great hotel and enjoyable stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach hotel in April 15 for four nights : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
A great fitness guide "Awan" bring us thru' the whole Nusa morning bike ride! He even share with us the local ceremony culture and the must visit place "Water Flow"! Well done! : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'bike-ride']
5 yr old kid - All of us were very happy with quality of service and surrounds : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
But very disappointed with the final result of the kids club confusion : [u'overall', u'culture']
The rooms well : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My sense is that the concierge don't really care about the guests b/c there's simply so many people staying there : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Already looking to book up our next visit : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
our room it's clean and spacious have balcony and big bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
This hotel ranks as one of the finest hotels I have visited : []
It is advice to the travellers that if you don't like resort's food then there is no option nearby as well! We tried to went outside for some romantic place for dinner but it was all in vain : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I have some comments on each of the room classes, and the hotel as a whole : []
Breakfast have variety choice included Balinese and Western : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Room was clean however matress was very tough & pillows are lumpy, so i've complained about it next morning to the duty manager who took care of it straighaway (Thank you) & offered us to be upgraded to Deluxe room (renovated room) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
My husband and I recently spent a few days at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort en-route to Europe and we were pleased to say it has not lost its charm : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Must agree with another reviewer on staff at breakfast - except for the welcoming lady, the rest was ordinary and it sometimes took multiple attempts to get attention or service : []
They have just appointed a new Executive Chef who I believe is a Australian who I am sure will keep the high standards of food being offered, lets hope he reviews the offering of some of the menu's and as a suggestion add a variety of fresh Subs or Sandwiches for lunch menu which are a great option on a hot day : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We will definitely be returning and probably book a one bedroom suite next time : []
Beach is nice & kept very clean although we encountered a rather large snake on the path to the gazebo on our first night : []
Most people compare this to M, but this hotel is easily the overall winner especially when you wake up feeling refreshed from the newly renovated room with new bed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a job opportunity which moved us to Singapore and now we are able to travel to places we never thought we would be able to before : []
Bargaining is pathetic : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

The staff were very attentive, professional and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Security is ever-present but not overwhelming : [u'overall', u'safety']
The SPA is a bit pricy but worth the pampering : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The infrastructure of this hotel is truly magnificent and built from quality materials withstanding the test of time, with Balinese influence throughout, very nice indeed : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I always try to get a deluxe room on the ground floor overlooking the pool area as I find this the most convenient to everything and you can just walk off the front porch onto the lawn : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They didn't even address us by our names : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The staff is very friendly and unobtrusive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The variety was very good especially the fruit selection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We will also be staying there again next time we visit beautiful Bali! : []
Room was kept cool all night with very efficient air-conditioning : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Service and location was perfect : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed from 31st Jan-2nd Feb and it was an absolutely beautiful & relaxing stay during those 2 days & 2 nights : []
the small ensemble of staff really make the club benefits special : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The bar staff (esp the bar pool man) and the pool side staff were very friendly as were many others : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Nice pool with plenty of room for the kids not to annoy everyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Doors also close loudly and anyone coming into their room late could wake you up : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Thankfully the next 9 days were extremely sunny : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the staff was very friendly as well, anything we needed they were quick to assist : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Again lots of Bali statues and architecture shows that you are in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was our second time at the hotel and it did not disappoint : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Great place to stay for quiet relaxing holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
It would be great if they could offer some more age-targeted activities, say something for the 7+ age group : []
good condition : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As it was still chinese new year period, it was crowed in general : []
Although the dining at the resorts restaurants is of exceptional quality, you will be paying a premium cost : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Plus bathrooms need renovating so it doesn't get flooded all the time : []
The facilities are great and convenient : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The resort is lovely, three great pools, right on the beach which has spectacular views of the volcano in the distance, lovely traditional gardens with an amazing entrance : [u'amenities', u'conference']
There are a number of places to eat some of which are open all day, the food and service was good, the breakfast buffet was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We were treated like royalty and found it quite humbling : []
Enjoying a drink on the beach or near the daybeds was just luxury plus plus : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I choose this hotel after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor, let me say this was a very good decision, the hotel is stunningly beautiful and is made in traditional bali style, I had booked the trip through a travel agent and the trip was very well organized we stayed there for 5 days from 15th to 19th Dec , the hotel staff was friendly and smiling always ready to help, I just have two complaints first the lift outside our room was not working so we had to walk a long way and second the hotel beach was not clean but I think that was out of the hotels control as it was rainy season, lastly with the ever increasing flow of Indians the hotel could use an Indian counter at the breakfast buffet, if you are going to bali stay here, bali is amazing and beautiful it has beaches, volcanoes, temples, palaces, culture, good food and friendly people : []
For the remainder of our stay I remedied the problem by pulling the bad cover down over the end of the bed to cover the sharpish protrusions : []
wood carving decorate the rooms beautifully : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Buffet breakfast was good and with many varied options to cater for almost anyone : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
we made friends with 3 other groups, one said they were in the top notch suites which was $4000 for 7 nights and it included everything, they were estastic, another group complained that it's the worse hotel they've ever stayed in as a 5 star, they called their travel agent back in Aust and complained which then got them upgraded, another group tonight was sooo upset, they was about to go and cancel there remaining nights and find another hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
But, on the Saturday, we had to wait in line for 30+ minutes just to get a table : []
There are also many restaurants aimed at every budget and, once again, the service is flawless : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Room mainly in good condition, although some weak & tear : []
It's a shame as they had many vacancies and still have - I booked a Superior and they still have plenty of Palace Club Suites available : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
amazing view and location very near to beach ( few steps away) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
So far so good : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff is very friendly and sweet : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had lunch a few times from the pool bar;s etc : []
The hotel has its own private beach, with sun chair, facing the sea : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Matahari department store is very good- clothing, shoes, bags, jewellery, gifts etc with fixed prices : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The chefs are always walking around filling up the pastry racks & eats : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
There are 3 pools:one has a bar, one has a volleyball net, and the 3rd a basket ball thingy : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Will recommend hiring the bikes and going along the path along all the resorts, very beautiful especially at night : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Nusa Dua Beach hotel used to be a sweet old hotel with character back in the 90s : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The food was fabulous for this nine day visit : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Don't pay more than $15 US for taxi to Hotel from Airport : []
The shower was great water pressure, and very modern : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
overall a good vacation : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast food is reasonable, however the staff and service is very ordinary : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The other one has a depth of 2 : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
But the young lady who was our watress was gracious and made it an adventure,although I am sure she was freezng : [u'overall', u'culture']
Highly recommend take the pre paid dinner option through the travel agt as it turned out to be excellent value : []
Next time in Bali, we're staying at the Ayala or the Intercontinental : []
I strongly recommend it to all : []
We probably would have spent a lot more there if the prices were not so prohibitive, instead we left the hotel to eat and drink : []
The afternoon tea and cakes were very nice although the coffees always tepid and half a cup measures : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I would definitely come back and stay here at this hotel : []
Its characterless but most guests go here at night instead, meaning the hotel is pretty much dead : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Thank you Nusa Dua Beach hotel staff for spoiling us and making our Christmas break at your hotel so special : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Not that big, especially not the bathroom : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
You can get a driver from around Bali Collection for $20 - $30 AUD a day or a metered taxi for shorter trips (the hotel charges a flat rate of about 50,000rp to get transport to the Nusa Dua area, say Bali Collection, whereas a metered taxi will be about 12,000rp) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup', u'post-room', u'checkout']
My room was 20 meters from the Lobby : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Location is far from famours shopping centre, such as discovery shopping mall, Kuta market : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The hotel is quite old, but you won't really feel it cos its very well maintained : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
An amazing pool and swim up bar with bars set around the pool aswell : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We recently stayed there for 2 nights with our 3 daughters and had a superb time : []
swimming pool floor quite slippery : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
We were moved to another room which was a bit nicer then a couple of days later they moved us again and that room was better again (I'd say 4 star) : []
I would definitely visit this resort again!!!! : []
We were very impressed on many levels with this hotel and in particular with the staff who were always willing to provide first class service : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We really enjoyed our stay at NDBH : []
By far, the strong point of the hotel, for me, was the enormous and varied breakfast buffet : [u'location', u'sea']
Upon arrival, the room I was put in was depressing, filthy, small and mouldy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The hotel was out of this world : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We hope that the service can be improved again to this hotel the hotel of choice of domestic and foreign guests : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Very well arrangement : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
All in all a great resort which ticked all the boxes for us in terms of relaxing and luxurious holiday with friendly people : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Also the spa is lovely and we appreciated not having to share the spa pool with children : []
Absolutely nothing to complain about! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The beds were squeaky, hard and uncomfortable : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Rooms in various blocks eg garden, pool or sea : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We were pleasantly surprised by the running of the Hotel : []
We had an amazing stay and loved every second of the experience : []
On one particular occasion my daughter was excited that a baking class would be scheduled : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I tried one of the Raja restaurant and ordered a 2 person meals and drink which cost me rp600,000, Wow!!! it was surprisingly know that the served portion were so small and actually not enough for two person : []
Could not speak more highly of the staff and facilities offered : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Did not want to leave as we were totally relaxed and enjoyed our spa treatments with Prisma and Mariati these girls were great : []
Situated in a superb lush garden, I personally found the temperature cooler that in the hustle & bustle of Kuta : []
I can't imagine anyone could possibly complain about anything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast was nice, but was the same everyday so was very boring compared to our last hotel which was very interesting : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It was absolutely beautifully : []
nd the location was too far out from the action of the local Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
This is one of the last real Balinese hotels with huge open lobby and all the restaurants are open so one can enjoy the amazing gardens, pools and beach : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Those travelling to Bali, this is a great tool to use as it will save you around an hour through customs and immigration : []
The choices did not vary much from day-to-day, but there was sufficient choice to stop you becoming bored : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is set amongst other 5 star hotels built 1 next to the other with no bounding wall separating them, which is great, you are able to walk down the pathway visiting other hotels, perhaps trying dinner at different places : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Whilst it looks amazing, we did slip a few times as its so polished! But would stay here again and recommend to anyone travelling to Nusa Dua : [u'location', u'sea']
It's real 5 stars here, but the entire Nusa Dua is so-so : []
My wife was offered the use of their private transport : [u'overall', u'culture']
We had a great time : []
We booked using a Luxury Escape Voucher which we thought was great value : [u'amenities', u'conference']
My son has life threatening food allergies and we were concerned that he would have limited choices but we had no cause for concern : []
The only inconvenient, which is the same for all the Nusa Dua resorts : Nusa Dua is far from Bali's most interesting places, so my advice is : first travel across the island and then have a rest in the NDBHS ! : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We were upgraded to a superior room, the friendliness of all staff, from cleaners to bar staff and restaurant persons were all of the highest standard : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The only negative was that it was a fairly long walk to restaurants and businesses but taxis & the hotel van were convenient : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
You should try to take a ground floor room as the doors open to the lawns and the duck pond : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A beautiful quiet private beach location, safe for swimming , there are plenty of beach lounges, under shady trees : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Good place to stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A must stay if you are planning a good time with family : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just spent a week at nusa dua beach resort and spa : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The bathroom smell was awful : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
The only note that we would like to add, is that maybe it will be a good idea to restrict kids into this area, since this is supposed to be a relaxing area, and not a playground! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hotel could do with some maintenance, but overall a great stay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our second visit to this beautiful hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Dian to departure where we wished a safe travel home by the Assistant Manager, our stay was one we will treasure : []
The practice of guests 'reserving' poolside loungers for the day by popping down in the morning and leaving numerous towels needs to be addressed, as does the noise that others made at all hours of the night, but I understand that can be difficult for staff : []
Service as to be expected, is superb, although a small criticism here: there is sometimes a problem getting beach service because the staff at the poolside bar has to serve both the pool and the beach : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We even had a bouquet of flowers sent to the room by the hotel General Manager : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Same goes for the adults with limited fresh salads or vegetables : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The bathroom however was fine with a roomy bath and a decent shower to match we had no complaints about the bathroom : []
Even room service was good, I could eat those fries all day long! : []
While waiting at the check in counter, the only staff in attendance was busy handling a couple who may have made some request and took him a long time to handle : [u'amenities', u'patio']
For a hotel established in the 80's this place is certainly keeping up with the times while maintaining the traditional Balinese feel with amazing structures and gardens : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They told me they would have to let me know later - I never heard from them : []
a FAIR price for a taxi to the hotel is around 150,000 rupiah : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
and the food also great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The meals we had throughout our stay were great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I realise we are not the only people on honeymoon, but come on : []
Breakfast provided an array of offerings and the staff always happy in being able to help : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We even had a chance to see the sun rise at the early morning with clear sky (luckily) : []
i believe this resort is 30 years old but they have gone to great lengths to keep the resort from looking dated : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Overall loved our stay and our kids made great friends! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Restaurant staff are inattentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I'm glad there's a website like tripadvisor where you can be honest about your experiences for others to read : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Its a heaven for golfers,10 mins walk takes you to nearest golf course : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Breakfast selection was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
We had a few issues that very well might be unique to my wife and I; you be the judge : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Cleanliness of room not in the same standard (chairs little bit dirty) : [u'overall', u'safety']
I visited the Nusa Dua Beach Resort with my wife as part of a 3 week holiday to Bali, Lombok and Hong Kong : []
The weather, location, food, people, resort was just incredible : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Been to the Sanur side and in the hills, small 28 room hotels with lots of character, even to Lombok at the Holiday Inn ( Beautiful hotel) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The lap pool, spa facilities are very nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Also the aircon in the room is just too warm and uncomfortably hot : []
Recommend the pizza and wedges (Chess Bar and Sandros) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
In spite of putting the AC high the rooms still stayed this way : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The beach is the nicest at Nusa Dua but the surrounding are a little boring : [u'amenities', u'conference']
As it is a private beach the hawkers are very controlled and do not bother or annoy you : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Balinese touches abound, from around the lobby through to our room with carved wooden architraves and Balinese slippers : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Mosquito issue at night especially at the restaurants near the pool/beach needs to be fixed for comfortable dine-in experience : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Because of our experiences at Buffets (breaksfast at Nusa Dua or themed dinners at other venues) we did not attend any of the Themed dinners at this Hotel : []
BUT we had a great time at this hotel : []
The choices are not too great, but it is fairly OK : []
-There are many places on the hotel grounds to lounge (ie huge main pool area with separate sand to pool area, smaller more private 25 meter lap pool area, lots of grass with garden area, private beach area, restaurants, kids playground area) : [u'location', u'general']
the barmen at the pool bar has to be one of the best as he always said hello to you by name when he saw you down by the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We hardly at there as they were too expensive : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The only thing I would not do whilst in Bali is go to the Turtle Island that we were taken to as it is a place where they let adults and children actually sit on the poor turtles and they have nik naks to take home made out of turtle shell! I felt very sorry for the animals and felt bad that i had just paid to get in and encourage this to continue : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
With 5 restaurants there are plenty of food choices, and th4e buffet breakfast was as good as any : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
fantastic experience overall : [u'location', u'sea']
Overall, we were very pleased with the Nusa Dua and highly recommend it : []
My only complaints would be that the rooms were a bit tired and showing their age, especially the bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Thank you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for making this such a memorable and relaxing holiday for all of us, and we can't wait till we can come back again : []
swimming pool etc : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Would prefer a balcony that was out of the weather so you could sit and read even if it was raining : []
I cannot fault the hotel in any way : []
The hotel is nice and very comfortbale rooms with all the mod coms : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel was fine, not good, and I would definitely not spend my tourism dollars by going back : []
The Kids club was AMAZING well the people were : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Management decreed that a taxi dropping off a passenger could not be used and we had to book at the 'taxi counter' (a seemingly empty area), so we walked as usual : []
We could not have picked a better place, for a relaxing holiday, great location, very grand, peaceful and tranquil gardens : []
serves very good food,nicely presented and good ambience : [u'overall', u'spacious']
What a great hotel, I cant recommend it highly enough, the location is great with a lovely beach, the staff were amazing, the local people so helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The beaches were lovely and you could walk for miles : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are 3 swimming pools, and we stayd mostly at the pool in the spa facility since no kids are allowed, so it is much more quiet and tranquil there : []
The bathroom amenities were poor : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I stayed here for 4 days : []
Would recommend to friends and family : [u'overall', u'culture']
I really enjoyed the stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
and would cheerfully go back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Food and drink prices were on par with surrounding hotels, keeping in mind that Nusa Dua in general is a little pricey compared to kuta & Seminyak : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
It's like chalk and cheese - by far this 5***** resort has exceeded our expectations in all areas : [u'amenities', u'pool']
I think there is another one just being built but don't really know when it opens : []
If You do not want to have all Your meals at the hotel there are some restauarants( and also shops) right outside the gate into Nusa Dua area, it takes about 10minutes to walk (and if You do not want to walk all restaurants have transportation) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Did notice inconsistent levels over different nights at the Chess bar restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Weather was perfect : [u'location', u'sea']
My family and I stayed at this hotel in Aug 2014 (very late review) : [u'overall', u'culture']
Would recommend the buffet breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We felt very safe and secure at the hotel with the beach security and the gates at the entrance were greatly appreciated : []
Having all this you will never be hungry : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
v) were a little old & worn however this did not spoil it at all : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was spacious and comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The room was more than adequate : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
She then just smiled and told us to "have a good day" : [u'overall', u'culture']
looking forwarded to returning to Bali but never again to this place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The breakfast is served at Wedang Jahe restaurant which is surrounded by lotus pond : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I was in Bali with my 2 very young children (husband was following at a later date) : [u'overall', u'culture']
The rooms, grounds, pools and waterfront areas are magnificent too : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
So beautiful experience and value for money, that I would love to come to bali every year just to stay in this hotel :) : []
The room we were then given (1114), which apparently was a palace club room, was once again not up to a 5 star standard : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We loved the lap pool and we loved the change room facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Wifi is only available at the lobby which was perfectly okay for us since we didn't want to be distracted by technology :) : []
Pool water was hot : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We ate here several times in the evening : []
Generally the rooms have a very good ambiance and a very authentic Balanise feel : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
My only gripe was the price of some of the food was pricey, especially the theme nights when there is a few of us to pay for and the room service was always cold at least 2 of the dishes which I think they should be made aware of as you are still paying top $$ for it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
excellent for children (and adults) : [u'overall', u'culture']
If you're expecting an ultra modern, western style hotel then you'll be disappointed and will need to choose a chain hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We booked a deluxe room for our wedding anniversary : []
Most restaurants in Tanjung Benoa and Bualu offer free transport to hotels, so there is a pretty good range of places to eat away from the hotel (recommend Bumbu Bali, Jalan Pratama, Tanjung Benoa) : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Had the three themed meals on the Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
This is so far number 1 on our list of venues to renew these vowes : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the free one just in the lobby : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
This is the best hotel I have stayed at in the world : []
Evening cocktails are also included along with a selection of nibbles : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
Stayed at the palace club room which gives you all the extra free-bees, and its worth the extra money : [u'amenities', u'conference']
That said there are many nice little restaurants not too far away from the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Overall experience was very pleasant : [u'overall', u'feel']
mango with local arak : [u'amenities', u'garden']
This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel and we just as good as the first and possibly even better : []
take antiacids! The food and drinks at the resorts are very expensive though : []
We could go to the beach anytime we want or come back anytime it was needed : []
Only lil grouse would be that the ac was not chilling enough especially in a hot country like Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
It was a case of find everything yourself : []
Taxi service in the hotel are pricy, like USD15 for a ride to Kuta : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Book extra with the Palace Club and you wil have the time of your life : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My other half and I stayed fur 3 nights for my birthday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Hotel with beautiful surroundings and beach : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We loved the Balinese influence of the hotel : []
Great hotel in terms of facilities, rooms, pool and restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed in a deluxe room for 4 and the size of the room is ample but not spacious, my parents stayed in a club suite for only a little bit more $$$ and their room had oodles of space and was much more modern and up to date so families may find better value for money doing it that way : [u'overall', u'culture']
Definately do the Spa promotion for the month whilst there, you will enjoy and appreciate it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There's a great path along the beach that runs along all of the resorts : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All in all the resort was a very nice location, very nice grounds and very nice staff to match, you can see the resort really needs to keep up its renovations and improve their in-room entertainment but generally it is a very nice, quiet and relaxing place to stay : []
The breakfast buffet was really, good ,though we always ate too much : []
thanks to all the staff for making our holiday a delight : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Lots of restaurants on-site and the poolside service was excellent : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
One remark, given the size this resort is more suitable for families and children then couples : [u'overall', u'culture']
Overall I like this hotel for business convention meeting related : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
She is a kid that LOVES kids club so this was a disappointment : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
There is simply nothing negative we can say about the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : []
They offered a very professional Babysitter for my baby neice during the wedding and the general customer service was great : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
This hotel is definitely best value for money in the Nusa Dua area : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Try to get a garden room on the ground floor : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Also, if you are going into Kuta at all, their supermarkets are significantly cheaper than the one in Nusa Dua, so buy all of your more expensive items whilst you are there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Everyone seems to head to the pool area & puts their belongings on sun lounges to reserve them, then goes off to breakfast/activities & some return to pool hours later : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We booked with no knowledge of the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
This experience did leave a sour taste in my mouth but we were unaware until we returned to the hotel and our guide wanted to know why we weren't picked up : []
The hotel is very peaceful, quiet and serene : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Excellent location if you are keen to walk : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We also had our dinner one day at Raja's Table restaurant which serves Balinese cuisine : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We booked a Deluxe Room for Four (2 Adults and 2 Teenage Children) directly through the hotel itself and was perfect : []
My wife and I chose to spend our holiday here and stayed for 11 nights in a Club access room : [u'overall', u'culture']
My wife did get bali belly but that was from same show bbq : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The ladies are lovely there also! They even put on a special birthday party for Jacob as he turned 6 while we were there and the hotel gave us a complimentary cake :) Just need to show your passport : [u'overall', u'culture']
The breakfast is very good, buffet style but with eggs, pancakes etc cooked to order : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The tub is very slick and deep : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub']
My room was designed with Kamasan painted and took a little times to adaptor into get a good sleep : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The other rooms which the rest of our party booked were lovely as well and no one had any complaints : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Afternoon Tea is served , is OK but consists of only Western food, I suggest some Asian savoury dishes be available as well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Firstly can I say we had a wonderful time at the Nusa Dua Hotel and Spa - just got back from an 8 night Luxury Escapes package : []
The hotel is located in a great location on the beach at Nusa Dua which is great if you want to swim in the ocean or walk along the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
+ and the staff ? extremely helpful, excellent! ( it was late at nite,n i really need something to buy, but the arcade area already closed, i went to the receptionist then they said for urgent case they can open it for us, and they really open it for me!!) thanks! : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
A fantastic and relaxing holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The front desk staff offer refreshing moist towels while they check you in : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Kids club is good but only if you have a child younger than 5 yr old : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff are gorgeous and the food really tasty : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We argued that it was included in the hotel and he said "okay 15minutes" which was extremely rude given that no one else was using them or had shown up for the session and was simply just trying to take our money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Nusa Dua is well away from the Bali surfing and active night spot and action scene : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
And the hotel made me wait for more than 2 hours (13:00-15:30) without any explanation : []
I stayed in the resort in 2009 and i think i owe this resort a review : [u'amenities', u'internet']
I always will recommend some one to stay at this resort, : []
I almost felt like I was home : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub']
The grounds are really lovely and the hotel is on the beach but I just didn't like it : []
We were then taken to our room (Batur Suite) : []
The driver who fetched us from the airport and who took us for two day trip was very knowledgeable of Bali and very polite too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
10 so based my decision on other reviews : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We loved the place, the atmosphere and the facilities : []
We're family traveler with two boys and strong fans of Nusa Dua : []
it was such a great stay in the newly renovated hotel : []
I recommend trying "Burgers on the Beach" which you can get for lunch from the Chess Restaurant : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast is excellent, room service is quick, the pools are good (when they're not over run with children, but you can escape to the spa pool of you feel there is too much going on in the main pools) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The suite was on two levels with a large living room, two bathrooms, kitchette, balconies with a large bedroom and bathroom upstairs : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We started off early from a rainy Kalibaru to cross the sea by boat and then further on land by car to Nusa Dua : []
Taxis are expensive to get out of the area, there is no walking, just a big shopping mall or two : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'general']
My wife and I stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa 5 years ago and had a really great stay : [u'overall', u'culture']
If you are out and about during the day, your taxi driver is more than happy to stop and let you stock up (of course the meter will be running, but the taxis are so cheap anyway this does not matter) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort is worn out and needs to be refurbished : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The research I do to pick the right hotel for my family takes me months : []
Just to relax and to enjoy the sea and the sun : [u'location', u'sea']
Suasana the manager really looked after us and my parents who arrived before us and booked it on arrival : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I had never wanted to go back to bali but after my stay at Nusa dua beach hotel I am definitely coming back and to this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I will list out my plus and minus points as follows: : []
Great service! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food is average, restaurant service is poor and partly unprofessional except for the Italian Restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Avoid having dinner in the hotel restaurants, the restaurants in the local area are nearly a third cheaper and offer a taxi ride home as part of the meal : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The grounds, pools, restaurants and rooms are wonderful, but most of all the staff are an absolute delight : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
What I love about this particular Nusa Dua spots (around these four hotels), you can take the glass bottom boat trip (250rb/boat/hour) off the hotel's beach provided is not during low tide : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Probably one of the overall best breakfast bars for quality and variety you would find : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My husband is an enthusiastic squash player and was happy to be partnered with 2 members of staff from the fitness club, even if he was beaten! I enjoyed the aquarobics by the pool in the mornings too : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Nusa Dua Hotel & Spa is one of the best hotels to spend your holidays in terms of quality of service, cleanliness and excellent location : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
In the end, we walked to local restaurants outside the resort where there were more and cheaper options : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Situated at Nusa Dua, the beach is almost perfect, away from the strong winds and currents : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Our Premier rooms overlooked the hotel's beautiful gardens : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
All worked well, this is not the first time we stayed in the hotel, previously was thirty years ago : [u'location', u'sea']
The only unpleasant experience was we had to wait for 2 hours during check-in because the room was not ready : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We loved the pools and being so close to a beautiful beach was wonderful : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
real value for money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
A lot of the restaurants there will arrange a free taxi ride back to the hotel for you, and you can barter with taxi drivers outside the hotel security : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Family with children, young and elderly couples : [u'overall', u'culture']
The free shuttle to Bali Connection from the hotel was disappointing! Total rip off : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Nothing is too hard for the staff and service is excellent, attention to detail above and beyond : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We are yet to attend the three dance shows/buffet dinners, so we can't comment on those yet, but expect nothing less than excellence! : []
We had massages included also : []
Pools, sun, friendly staff, good company : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We quite liked the restauarant on the beach at a neighbouring property, I guess laguna resorts : []
It has a beautiful Indonesian feel : []
If your a drinker make sure you collect your duty free as spirits at the hotel were expensive : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The setting there is so elegant and refined : []
Although I talked as clearly and slowly as I could, and they repeated it back, they still stuffed up our order every single time! It was difficult to feed fussy kids because the staff had limited flexibility : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Good service from beach staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There are lots of activities inside and outside the resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We loved the traditional Balinese style of the hotel, very different to the modern resorts in the Nusa Dua area and exactly the right place to stay for a proper Bali experience : []
tghe hotel is spotlessly clean the rooms are comfy & have all the ammenities you could want,the staff made us feel like royalty & nothing was to much for them,the gardens,spa area & pools are first class & help to make this hotel a relaxing paradise resort,private beach daytime activities & kids club just henhance further your stay,we would not hesitate to return in the future as our time spent there will always hold a place in our memories,thankyou nusa dua beach hotel & spa : [u'location', u'sea']
The pizza is superb, the "jamu" at the breakfast is one of the best I have had in hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
On my return to the hotel I was sincerely welcome, and we were offered a very generous prolongation stay at the hotel till I could fly back : []
, and unfortunately all the restaurants were closed at that time in the Hotel, (we have to order room service) : []
However since the resort is rather old,the plumbing system needs upgrading including replacing some tiles in the bathroom : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
the hotel gives u a VACATION and resort feel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
You need to have a rack to hang wet bathers and hooks in the bathrooms to hang things on : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However this did not cause any discomfort while taking nice naps after lunch on the calm and peaceful beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Quick check in and out, friendly staff, and excellent services : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
What a beautiful hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bonus for us as loungers by the pool were easy to get, spa bookings easy and overall staff jumping out of their skin to help us in any way : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It probably helped that we arrived at the very start of the season (April 2013) so it was very quiet : []
so much variety and the food was amazing : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We also had two spa packages, and the spa was the best we've been to : []
Would definitely stay here again, can't wait for our next trip back : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
The ambiance here was one of serenity and luxury : [u'overall', u'spacious']
So, needless to say, I had to worry about arguing with them that night and the next morning about my previously paid for services : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The food in the restaurants was ok but nothing special, which you might expect for the prices they charge : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
What a wonderful experience to stay at your Hotel and in Bali ! I am so happy to have the chance to be in such a hotel and on your island ! I am in love with the Light of the Bali and I make the wish to come back again : [u'overall', u'feel']
Terima Kasih from Janet & Ross : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
You need to PAY for WIFI : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is a wonderful selection of food in the breakfast area, the staff here and in the other dining areas were friendly and attentive : [u'location', u'general']
We recently spent 5 nights at the Resort : []
We loved the feel of the hotel as it still keeps with the traditional Balinese feel from its gardens to its architecture and is very relaxing : []
Meals were good breakfast was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
This was my second time in this hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Helped by the beautiful weather as well : [u'location', u'sea']
The hotel staff do try but they don't have much to work with in terms of quality of rooms or the food : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The staff were super helpful and attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had a free upgrade to a family room so there was lots of extra room for the 4 of us : []
Booked a Deluxe Double : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Having stayed in the Palace Club at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel on many occasions and always loving it, I was slightly disappointed this time around : []
We loved all the restaurants, and the beautiful walk along the beach at night time (when you walk past all the other Hotels) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Travel out of school holiday periods for a perfect /quieter resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room was nice and cool upon arrival and my husband loved that because it can get very humid there : []
I also did the garden tour and loved hearing about all the wild life, plants etc : []
The staff are excellent, always remembering our names : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We tried the kids club twice and were disappointed : []
The hotel is nice and the food is amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Last night getting a taxi was tough and the Samuri warrir at the front told us that it was always better to walk : []
The highlights were the good service by Anni at the tour desk - the diving/cruise with Bali Hai is awesome & not to be missed! Also dinner at Jimbaran is a must do! Nothing about this hotel is particularly special- & we would not return : []
The assistant Manager took us to a pool side room on the ground floor, in the smoking section : [u'overall', u'culture']
The rooms were exceptionally clean and although a little tired looking, were still to a very high standard : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overpriced water sports and massages so be sure to barter : []
We found the staff to be very pleasant and always willing to help, : []
Fabulous service, great atmosphere, excellent location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I stayed there for 5 nights and it was an amazing experience : []
I was expecting nice beach, but it was not, the beach out of Nusa dua hotel is full of shell/coral fragments and particles which really hurt when you are going out there with barefoot, and the sands are way too rough and full of rubbish, i would not recommend to bring kids along, although the sea water is clean but your mood will definitely get turn down by the rubbish and rough sands : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
The overall design of the hotel is not only incredibly clever- its something special that I will remember for a lomg time to come : []
Without exception every member of staff greeted us with a big smile and nothing was too much trouble, we really did feel like their valued guests : []
you have to buy a card from the lobby store to get online first (you cannot log on from your room without it) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms and pool area are very good : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Service around the pool was slow and not possible during happy hour, as I was travelling alone with a child, each time I wanted to order something my child had to get out of the pool, we had to walk the long way around due to works, and order a simple drink : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
Bali is a wonderful place, Nusa Dua Beach is a great place to stay : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
This would also apply to Nusa Dua as place as well : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We have stayed at this hotel twice before and this time took advantage of a luxury escapes package to upgrade to the palace club, and loved every moment of it : []
I spent a lot of time researching hotels and villas in Bali : []
Staff friendly and willing to help at all times : [u'location', u'sea']
I wouldn't stay again at this place : []
Won't be back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The room quality is bad and the size of the room is too small, the bathroom is incredible small with cockroaches : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Stayed in Palace Club Suite : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The rooms could do with a bit of a touch up but all in all they were comfortable and spacious not that you spend much time in it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We went around 5ish and noticed great crowds coming around 6 : []
You can enjoy a meal and soft drinks in the restaurant and then you can be able to spend a romantic time to walk to the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beds and pillows were incredibly comfortable : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Towels are changed twice a day and the bed is turned down at night : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
Morning by the beach is beautiful : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The GM's cocktail party was a special highlight, we met the GM who is to be congratulated on his management of this hotel : [u'amenities', u'patio']
, to cater for the people who do not eat seafood other wise everything from breakfast, room service etc : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Just a few note for your "suite" room; : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
A great place, very relaxing, but you really could be anywhere tropical : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The setting of the hotel is simply fabulous - beautiful and immaculately manicured grounds : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
This is a very big complex with many great facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Hotel has the potential to be a world class hotel but sadly falls short : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Glass bottom boats and snorkelling are available from the beach, which was white sand and very clean : [u'amenities', u'conference']
There is renovations going on which were annoying to hear an angle grinder running all day and well into the night : [u'amenities', u'conference']
As expected the hotel is expensive to eat at but it's only 10 mins to walk out the Nusa Dua main gate and there are markets that we found as cheap as the rest of Bali (bargain hard) we bought new style tops for rp 30,000/40,000 and sparkly shoes for 25,000 : []
2 umbrellas were even provided in the room, to ensure guests were prepared for the heavy rain shower that happened each late afternoon / evening! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Kudos to them! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Friendly and efficient staffs : [u'overall', u'safety']
The surroundings were also pleasant with plenty of seating in shaded areas outside or in an airconditioned space for those who wanted to cool off : [u'amenities', u'patio']
My husband and I visited this hotel in November 2010 and had an incredible time! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable vacation : [u'overall', u'culture']
The hotel was wonderfully quiet and relaxing and we really needed this on this stay : []
The main entrance to the hotel beautifully connects the interior to its tropical surroundings : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
The staff are helpful and very attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I hope to return to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel next year and for many years to come : [u'location', u'sea']
Me and my family, 2 daughters, we there fof the end of December and we dine on the 25th at the hotel : []
Almost everything in the room was old fashioned, but it well maintained : []
Also the lower tap head is too long sticks out further than the top shower head so you tend to knock into it as you take your shower plus the sharp edges of the design is not child friendly : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We have stayed at Nusa Dua beach resort for 6 nights : []
Staff friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Yes, they have a small pond beside the breakfast area : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Our sincere commendation to management and all staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
But the overall experience was a very memorable one! : [u'overall', u'feel']
If you're looking for a western style, ultra modern hotel, then it's not the Nusa Dua, but if you want Balinese culture, a quality service and a hotel offering excellent facilities - look no further : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The shops at the Galleria offer a wonderful array of well-made hand crafted souvenirs and gifts : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Downside no local restaurants but $2 in a taxi to the Nusa Dua strip of restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
00 pm with no limits as drinks included : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Our suite was located in the Palace Club section of the resort : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
friendly service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Further an absolute perfect location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Private beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Not worthy of a five star rating due the experience and quality of accomodation and overall experience : [u'overall', u'feel']
Overall, a great choice as long as you don't expect to stay on site for your meals! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We chose this hotel because of very good TripAdvisor family reviews : []
You will be waiting a long time to be served food and drinks : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall it wasn't overly expensive, there are a variety of restaurants which have reasonable priced meals (wine is expensive though!) - food is excellent quality : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The included breakfast was awesome, and catered for me being vegetarian and pregnant : []
It was a most appreciated gesture : []
kind guide for our diving experince : []
We also like the quiet and peaceful area of Nusa Dua : []
Strongly recommend : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We are planning to book and return in July!!! Love it! : []
A good choice if you want to stay away from the hassle of crowded parts of Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very good gym : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Lots of little restaurants within the complex and by the beach to order some drinks and food : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Room #1151 on the ground floor close to front reception and lounge bar areas was very comfortable, clean and the aircon worked well : []
The only reason why we decided to stay somewhere different this year was because the Pool at The Mirage was a little too deep for our 6 year old : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We spent 1 week here and had a great time : []
We went to Waterbom and spent the day there to maximise our gazebo, which was a nice relaxing way to do things : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel also has an excellent gym (which my partner used before breakfast a few times) and spa centre, with separate mens and ladies saunas and spa pools, as well as a large outdoor lap pool : [u'overall', u'culture']
Very quiet relaxing resort : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
The Hotels accommodation is currently being renovated with no disruption to the hotel's operation and facilities as they are completing a wing of accommodation at a time : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The beach is immaculate and cleaned daily : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The only downside of this resort is that the Wi-Fi is only free in public areas, meaning that to watch streaming movies from your iPad in your bed, you would have to purchase a Wi-Fi access : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were lovely and very helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
excellent value for money package : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We booked the Nusa Dua Beach Hot e based on the very good reviews we read on Trip advisor and Booking : []
The staff at the hotel where great, nothing was ever too much trouble for them and they were always willing to help : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
And the garlic bread is the WORST : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I have nothing but great things to say about this hotel and can't wait to return soon : []
hope you will improve! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Variety and quality is mediocre : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Great access to the beach, just a tiny walk there : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
My spouse and I upgraded to a deluxe room, and my mum had a superior (standard) room : [u'overall', u'culture']
The bathroom could have been cleaner and we had to request our towels almost daily : []
Nusa Dua is not far from the Ngurah Rai Airport, if you need airport pick up from hotel do not forget to mention to reservation team : [u'location', u'airport']
Older hotel but rooms and hotel in excellent shape : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also explained my 6yo is very tired and needs to sleep so could they please get it out ASAP so we can call it a night : []
The food and Beverage Manager Sinead was lovely as well, always took the time to chat and ask how you were : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to anyone : []
There are many hotel facilities, easy enough for our 7 and 9 year old to organize and attend themselves : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We actually MET on Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Beach lovely : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
After 3 meals in the hotel we started looking elsewhere : []
I stayed in this hotel on many occasions before, and being the first hotel in the peninsula, i reckon the rooms looked tired naturally : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
But when the tide is out in the afternoon there is no swimming : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
I am sure we will go back within a couple of years : []
My family and i stayed for 4 nights in a premier room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
There are also lots of water sports available at Benoa just down the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So many of the other resorts only make a passing nod to Indonesia : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We recently had 8 nights here with the kids (11,13,15) and had a great time : []
We had no curtains in the main bedroom so the morning light streamed in very early but I rang house-keeping to ask if the curtains could be put up again and they promptly arrived although only one curtain was available but it helped,Ok apart from those few negative observations it is a lovely resort in a perfect position on the beach : []
you'll truly be gobsmacked by the unbelievable selection at breakfast! 4 restaurants to choose from serving mouthwatering creations : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We visited Kuta which we found to be busy, commercialised and grubby, lots of young surfers and party groups about : []
I am amazed that such a big resort has nothing in place for beach rescue : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Good was very perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua is a lovely area to stay if you prefer to be away from all the hustle and bustle but is a nightmare in traffic during peak traffic times to get back to : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We booked on an indulgence package and found it fantastic value : []
However they have no problem in people drinking their own alcohol : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
the breakfast was superb : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
This is the main reason I kept going back and try to avoid modern / minimalist style hotels in Bali : []
The downsides were 1) No wifi in room; and 2) Cleaing matters : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We stayed for 8 days & tried all the restaurants on site & all were good but my favourite has to be the pizzeria which is in the middle of the complex right next to the swimming pools : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I highly recommend this resort - we had a great time! : []
There is squirrels everywhere and we enjoyed watching them and even feeding them some fruit, probably not the best idea though because we did get scratched twice : []
I love Bali and while Nusa Dua is a little engineered you can't help but loving it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Grand Hyatt has a great Indonesian buffet, the restaurant & bar on the beach at the Westin ( next door ) were much better quality than our hotel & I highly recommend asking the concierge to make you a booking for dinner at Bumbu Bali, a great restaurant in Tanjung Benoa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff were friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We booked through Luxury Escapes on a fantastic value deal : []
BEST IDEA EVER!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
1) Barely half of the staff speak English which is weird for a leading hotel though, : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We enjoyed our stay very much : []
All the better resorts and good hotels in this area which is new developed : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The room - ours was the most basic - was large enough and had a balcony that overlooked a fountain! Breakfast was pretty standard, with decent food choice and quality and the occasional live music entertainment : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would definitely return and recommend to anyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As noted by myself and other TA reviewers, hospitality and service is a key ingredient of this hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
What can I say? The suite, comprising a bedroom with walk in robe, full bathroom en suite and a balcony, a lounge/dining, second w/c with vanity, a (non cooking facility) kitchen and balcony on the top (4th) floor, overlooking gardens : []
The grilled whole snapper was a standout : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
beds were not comfortable : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Maybe we were not so lucky because of holidays in Europe, I don;t know, it could be that in another period of the year it is less crowded : []
This is our fourth trip to Bali but the first time at this hotel and we loved it! From the pick up at the airport from the hotel which l would suggest as their is a lot of construction going on and negotiating the terminal can be tricky for newcomers, to the check in process at reception it all went like clockwork : []
Would highly recommend this magnificent hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff were sensational to me and my children : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
You will find a pharmacy, restaurants, a general store and other shops : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The service on the Hotel was perfect from the reception to the rooms : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff in the Kids Club are really friendly and make such an effort with all of the children : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I wish to say 'Thank you' to all staff : []
There is a jogging track which runs the length of the property and also the other 5 star resorts that border the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were surprised upon our arrival at the hotel, the hotel is HUGE (we didn't expect it because we made the booking at very last minute, thus didn't do much research on this hotel) and they have good services, spa, lounge, beach and many more : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We would return again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
My wife and i purchased a deal of luxury escapes for eight nights 1400 dollars : [u'overall', u'culture']
For me, all these justify the higher rate : [u'location', u'sea']
It was a great family holiday : []
only in lobby has free wifi, if you need to use wifi in your room, you need to pay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is about a 40min taxi from Kuta where all the action/restaurants/shopping are found, this is fine if you can go out during the day and night but not good if you have small : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We also went to Jimbaran Bay and was honestly quite horrified at the condition or restauarnts and general hygiene, we felt far from safe walking down the street, especailly with groups of men all sitting on the side of the road looking menacingly towards us, I hoenstly thought we were a moment from being robbed or worse, we couldn't get a cab quick enough to get back to the resort : []
Friday night bbq buffet with Fire Show was also great : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Resort is ok but not 5 star or worth the money : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Our room was on the ground floor so we had a patio that lead to the near pond, where there was plenty of wild life! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
You did feel as if you were in some sort of paradise : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Outside the front of the hotel you can walk along paths also to the many hotels, so you are not restricted in one area or hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The chaotic traffic & pollution turns us off from going to Kuta, Legian or Seminyak and Nusa Dua with the clean beach and botanical gardens is like paradise : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Would recommend to all - rooms with balcony were fantastic for an afternoon read or feed the squirrels : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
Allan 10 May, 2015 : []
"asked" to look/buy from their stalls, not as forthright as in Kuta but more : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Actually the A/C were working, but not that cold in the daytime, at night I still can slept well : []
Admittedly it is expensive, but nothing you wouldn't expect for a 4-5 star hotel in such a wonderful location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff definitely greet you whenever they see you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I could not have done this without you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The sands are almost sandy white compared to the brown volcanic sands in Kuta and Seminyak : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The Chess Bar by the beach has a mixed style of menu, overall pretty good value, we ate there a couple of times : []
I have only ever stayed in a Palace Club room, so can only comment on that : []
Resort facilities were elegant yet relaxed : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This hotel caters mainly to the corporate client and big functions and holiday makers have to endure the big dinners and entertainment that goes with that : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
read more reviews if you wish, but you will love it here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Concierge was really helpful although the driver that they booked for us took us ridiculously expensive shops where they tried to sell a wooden carving to 2,800 USD where we bought the same to 60 USD elsewhere : []
If your going to Bali this hotel is definitely worth a stay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The swimming pool is big and there is also water aerobic in the morning which made our holiday more fun : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The rooms are comfortable (premier room may be a touch bigger than deluxe), pools are excellent (esp : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time here in March 2005 : [u'location', u'sea']
We had a very pleasant stay except for the very high humidity-even the swimming pools were quite warm : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
especially after getting my long blonde hair 'done' at the resort's beauty salon : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The hotel and grounds are fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
in that sense, i felt a bit awkward : []
The resort was immaculately clean throughout and the always-smiling staff were warm, friendly, polite and very helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Generally the staff friendly and helpful esp Palace club : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We all also enjoyed the themed evenings/buffets in the theatre : []
10 out of 10 for this hotel! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This is just our opinion, but compared to other hotels in the Far East and Indian Ocean it compares very favourably with those in the same price bracket : []
Nothing really works properly in the room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The Nusa Dua Beach is a Nico Place to stay for a relaxed Beach Holiday : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We were staying at the family room on the 3rd floor at the corner, overlooking the swimming pool : []
Breakfast is awesome, with western, eastern and local fare laid out in a sumptuous buffet : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Before I booked my stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa I checked out every review for hotels in the area on this exact website : []
I travel to Bali last March ~~~ : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The breakfsast was OK, but the food tasted like it had been prepared many hours prior to breakfast : []
They possess a yes-attitude, if possible, which is essential to any tourists : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The fire dance night and our last meal on the beachfront were also special : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The daily included breakfast is just amazing : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The pool facility was immense with plenty of lounge chairs to find : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If you are looking for a relaxing hotel with a great beach, nice pools, superb staff and a beautiful setting this hotel is certainly worth considering : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Kids club: My 8 year old daughter liked the club very much : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
We were introduced to this hotel by a travel agent who gave rave reviews : [u'amenities', u'patio']
very beautiful hotel and has very polite stuff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The resort was wonderful, the staff were very friendly and always willing to help : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It's older than others in the area but with this comes some great Bali feel and design : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Despite the room difference, we enjoyed our stay so much that we will definitely come back : []
However, I think a 5 star Hotel need to create a "WOW" : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Great reception, rose petals in the tub, a heart made of orchids at the bed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
great authentic feel to this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
But it is very easy to take free shuttle bus to Bali Collection and enjoy excellent food for very affordable prices : []
I guess not : []
But the whole Island is just a taxi ride away : [u'location', u'sea']
Melia: Fun, Livelier BUT tired room and beds (back pain for me) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
3 females on holiday together and we all voted this the most attentive and relaxing resort ever : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Perhaps some rice , spring rolls or samosa, the sausage rolls were delicious though : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast buffet was impressive in its diversity : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
It looks more like a compulsion as if they have been told to do so : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The Spa would best be described as Balinese and is worthy of the treatments : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Im generally not one for "sit on a beach/at a pool and relax" holidays, but this was a very nice place to spend one : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Two huge and beautiful swimming pools - one with a swim up bar and the other with pool volley ball and a sand beach entry : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Note though that this is a resort and not near any real shopping or dining accomodations outside of the complex : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pools were great for the kids and the location with the beach was lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The spa was also very beautifully kept : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The bedroom was very large, with closets and writing area off : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
While it was a nice place, I did find that the balconies were a bit different in that it was just a handrail separating them with no privacy : []
I could go on about the resort, beach and food, which were all amazing! But what I think was most memorable about the place where the staff : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The location is excellent and only a short walk away from Bali Collection where you can find all the copy designer goods as you would find in Kuta but a little more expensive, and what I mean by more expensive in terms of Aussie dollars is minimal : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
well, mission pretty much accomplished : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This resort far exceeded our expectations, very balinese in its character and atmostphere : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Very close to the breakfast restaurant and the pool area : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff were great and genuinely lovely : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
One thing we did do was use the babysitting service and we highly recommend using these ladies : []
Staff were helpful and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We stayed a week and really didn't want to leave : []
There is a shopping centre about 10 mins walk from the hotel which has plenty of shops and eateries : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This was one of the only positive things I can say about the staff at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
These hotels could be at any beach (from Hawaii to Phuket), but at least with the NDB Hotel, you knew you were in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort is beautifully maintained and the pools were stunning : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The pool area was great and the drinks in the pool bar were delicious! The only concern we had was that people would go put their towels down and then go for breakfast so if you didn't get down early it was difficult to find a chair by the main pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The rooms are not overly spacious, but clean and well appointed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Remembering our names, drink and snack preferences made us feel welcome and at home : []
Keep up the good work "Mr Dermot" - it was lovely to chat to you again and hope to see you at the Rugby soon! : []
Always helpful and genuine : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thank you Nusa Dua Hotel! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a premier room that was closest possible room to the wedding bale and steps from the pool which was very convenient however was far away from the lobby so if you don't like walking to/from check-in, check-out and breakfast then I would request something a little closer to the lobby (although keep in mind the whole property is massive, as are a lot of the hotels in Nusa Dua so you will be walking no matter what) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We received 6 spa treatments as part of our deal and they were devine and the ladies were always smiling and the spa areas very clean : [u'overall', u'culture']
We stayed in Nusa Dua during the day and then had a babysitting service (provided by an expert lady that made us confident) in order to spend some eventings in Seminyak : []
The staff will most likely get you to do it according to their convenience (like early in the morning) : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
My only comment on this resort that they need to keep the beach resturant open till mid night, because all resort's restaurants are closed at 10 PM : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Being on the third floor we had one floor above us, and my only complaint would be that we could hear the people in the room above scraping their chairs on the floor every time they moved them, and boy did they like to move them a lot - it was like a furniture removal convention up there : []
Overall in my opinion If you are a person who would stay here all day and occasionally go out sight seeing then look nowhere else : [u'amenities', u'patio']
probably we will come back : []
Highly recommended for businesss travellers, families or justget away weekends : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The pool at the spa (which all hotels residents can use) is a delight : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Forcing POISONOUS 2 nd hand smoke on young children, pregnent women and people dinning is NOT ACCEPTABLE : [u'overall', u'culture']
The secondary pool leaves a bit to be desired : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Pro-tip: Ask for a local taxi instead of the hotel taxi - costs much cheaper : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup', u'post-room', u'checkout']
The reason why i would not reccomend this hotel is that it's facilities (i : []
of course with a spa treatment for a bit of pampering! : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Bali Collection has a host of yummy restuatrants to cater to all tastebuds, wherever you came from : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
taxi ride away from a shopping complex with a few additional restaurant options : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The resort itslef is lovely and very traditional in comparison to some of the other resorts in the area : [u'location', u'general']
The hotel is in a compound consisting of several large, Western-style, luxury hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It's my second visits in this property and a traditional Balinese resort : []
Does the hotel have great spacious rooms : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We had just one night at this hotel - and one night was enough! It's not the sort of place we normally stay, as we like a bit of local authenticity : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Nusa Dua is about 30min taxi drive to Kuta and Seminyak : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Fantastic Resort, great spa, hard to fault anything in regards to the facilities or location : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The Hotel Service was very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Food at the restaurants was reliably very good and service always very friendly : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The household staff were a joy and made up our room daily with care - nothing was too much to ask- Our memories are great : [u'overall', u'culture']
I guess I was anticipating a better experience? It was the cheapest on hotels : [u'overall', u'feel']
simply loved the place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Stayed for 7 nights in august as part of our honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
Although I did have to show my bites in places mosquitoes couldn't possibly have bitten me in order to have them believe me, 2 weeks later the bites are still all over me : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
then manager lies to your eyes that it's happened for the first time and send u fruits : []
Make sure get up early just for the sunrise at 6 : []
no words could ever describe how perfect our stay was! It was by far the best hotel we have ever stayed in and will be recommending this place to everyone! Thank you to everyone at the hotel for making our stay one to remember! I think its one place where I would actually live :) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It really is a fantastic place to stay : []
All the staff were good, especially at Maguro's and the theme dinner nights : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The hotel amenities & the staff's friendly attentive service were as fantastic as usual : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
They also separate the pork contain food from the other : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
They have 3 pools and it is lovely to walk around the beach path : []
It was very big and grand yet had a lovely tropical feel with a Bali theme : [u'overall', u'culture']
Bali Collection Shopping Centre is also 10 minutes walk, with department store shopping and market stalls in a mall : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
Definitely is a good hotel for family vacation or business : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Stayed in a slightly older pair of inter-connected rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The garden area is huge and you need a bike to get around to see it all : []
The food was fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We really enjoyed our stay, The hotel is relaxing and the staff marvellous : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Just back from Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa where we spent a wonderful 8 nights : []
So in conclusion - would we go back again, and would would recommend this hotel to anyone else - the answer is YES on both counts : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
Hotel is true Bali not some modern clinical type : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The gardens were beautiful and well maintained and the resort was very spacious and therefore very peaceful : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Second time to Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa and loved every minute : [u'amenities', u'patio']
In fact words can not describe fully what you get there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We travelled with teenagers who loved this place : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Apart from the weddin most of us were there between 4-10days and it was fabulous, the rooms are beautiful, and if you want to get away for quiet times a lap pool with Cafe was just the best : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Staff are also very respectful of wildlife around the hotel : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
we really loved them : []
We heard feed back from other Nusa Dua guests that they were not good : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel was spotlessly clean, from the pool area to the fish ponds : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The roads in Bali are not good, so this area was pleasantly surprising and an excellent choice for celebrating my 40th birthday : [u'location', u'general']
Simply Beautiful ,nice service,nice beach and a lot of activities,we will go next time for sure!!! : []
Wonderful spa facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I am very thankful for Adi's help : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is also work going on at the hotel to refurbish a whole section of rooms but it wasn't intrusive and the fact that half the hotel was closed actually made getting a sunbed in the morning much easier!! It must be very difficult when it's full : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My only surprise at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was on checking out : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We purchased a package through Luxury Escapes and stayed in the Palace Club suites and were lucky enough too enjoy the excellent club facilities, including a la carte breakfast, afternoon tea and afternoon cocktails : []
The spa was amazing : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The food outlets are good particularly the Maguro Asian bistro : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant']
The food was fabulous and reasonably priced for resort facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We had a beautiful 5 night stay here in Oct : []
Staff and overall experience was great as well as the spa : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The food was lovely, with a never ending range of fresh fruit juices : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Keep excelling and thanks to all the staff for a fabulous stay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only downside, is that the staff follow the letter to the law and aren't always flexible but I put that down to cultural differences more than anything : []
We ate at five different restaurants within the hotel and always found something interesting & different : []
They have some funny squirrels jumping on your balcony : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However when you go to breakfast you are aware of how occupied the hotel is : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Furnishings are chipped and show a lot of wear : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
Nusa Dua is a gated peninsular about 30 Mins from Denpasar and Kuta : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The Place Club room is definitely worth the upgrade, if not just for the lounge access : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The Westin was next door : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Buffet breakfast was good and poolside restaurant was also : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The breakfast buffet was also really good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We had lovely wellcome& our room : []
All meals included - were from 3 restaurants - all delivered lovely tasty food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Taxis from the Hotel were good value to anywhere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Breakfasts offered a wide range of terrific food as did the other dining facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We went for our honeymoon in feb 2011 and stayed here for 3 nights : []
The breakfast in the morning was really good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There is many staff that has worked at the Hotel for more than 20 years and offer true Balinese hospitality with a smile : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a lovely time at the hotel but was slightly put out at the cost of a taxi when you use the hotel task service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is in a great position for walking around and looking out side the complex of hotels, the gardens are lush and although some things are a bit worn everything is spotlessly clean and well maintained : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I would like to know : []
The rooms smell and feel damp, we asked to change rooms and all of them smell damp! The wifi is available in the room but they charge you for it! Free wifi is a service you would expect from a 5 star hotel, especially that it's been pouring down since we arrived 3 days ago : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
Along with the cocktails there was always hot finger food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We paid about 110,000 rupiah for a taxi to Legian (30-40 mins) : []
The fridge doen't work and I'm still waiting for someone to come and repair it : []
Then we have the hotel facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We recently stayed 6 nights at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & loved every minute : []
The setting was gorgeous, candle lit and full silver service with our own waiter etc, they even sent over a trio of musicians which was awesome! I'm pretty sure the gourmet restaurant there is Raja's, superb food and service! : [u'amenities', u'conference']
For the 4 days we stayed, we had the nearly the same international breakfast spread everyday : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We would definitely recommend this resort : []
Naturally, you do get a little bit bored after a few days but then isnt this the case with most breakfast buffets? : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We also had room service which was excellent : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Apart from breakfast the only meal we had at hotel was one lunch- pizza and it was OK but too expensive! Service was good as expected at 5star hotel BUT not more - I did not feel the same "personal touch" as I did at Bali Hyatt : []
I would say 3+ or 4 if im very generous : []
Breakfast and evening cocktails make this the best deal around : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
How can I not describe about The Spa, ahh felt so relaxing and a Nusa Dua Full Massage treatment gave me another booster to my body and it was excellent : []
Within the resort there is also a spa and personally had not tried the spa packages here as the prices are more expensive : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
One of the original hotels in Nusa Dua in true Balinese style : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The hotel is only a 10-15 mint walk or a short ride to excellent shops and restaurants at Bali Collection : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Wi-Fi works every where except in d room (almost till d beach!!) which is very good as compared to other hotels : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We stayed at the NDBH after 6 nights in Legian : []
I did not feel appreciated at all during my stay : []
We had our wedding at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa back in September 2012 and we fell in love with the place : []
While Nusa Dua is a bit of a resort enclave, the hotel building itself still had a lovely Balinese feel to it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed in a Deluxe room and it had beautiful bali charm and was spotless : []
I must comment on the Cherry Tiramisu served at the Poolside Pizzeria : []
I however was on my own! But still had a lovely time : []
The room we stayed in was nice and very clean and tidy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
If there had been a standing shower area and a extendable shower head it would have been ideal when showering babies : []
Laundry, Room Service, Gym and Spa are top notch : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
It was well worth the extra money, it included breakfast at the Palace Club lounge, afternoon tea and sandwiches, cake and scones, and then for two hours in the evening cocktails and canapes : []
When we were there the hotel was about 50% occupancy, which resulted in there not being other kids there, as a result of this our kids didn't use the kids club until late in our stay when another child was there for them to play with : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We love it here and highly recommend Nusa Dua Resort to anyone who needs a break away : [u'amenities', u'patio']
the main hotel that we only used this once : []
priceless location (we stayed at the Westin next door a year ago and this is our second visit in 2 years) : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Just a few improvements needed in some areas : [u'location', u'general']
You can either lay on the private white sand beach or by the the swimming-pools while drinking cocktails : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Ok the most people make the reservation early in the morning, sometime nobody come to use this seats : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
It is Nusa so all the hotels/resorts are all within the Resort compounds : []
Breakfast is excellent and covers evey continent : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Such a huge array of dishes - the selection and the quality of food was fantastic : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We were lucky as our room was upgraded to a top floor palace club suite complete with a large balcony overlooking the beautifully kept hotel grounds : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
will definitely return : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I loved the friendly staffs, location, living quality and food : []
The hotel itself was just what my wife and I where looking for : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very clean hotel, & friendly staff : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
I loved the spa treatment and the daily beach yoga class was fantastic : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
Room service was good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We didnt use spa or salon facilities due to being over priced, if you go to town you'll find that spa prices 50% cheaper than at the resort, so as restaurants are very expensive, so we didnt eat in the resort, we had to go outside : []
The disabled room was brilliant, large and superbly equipped with shower bench, rails - toilet and shower, and the hotel itself was fully accessible with disabled toilets and ramps/lifts (which is rare) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Wasn't it a nasty sight? Very unpleasant : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The statue, the praying area, carved wooden ornaments : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Another irritation was the shower stall do not have a door and subsequently the bathroom floor is always wet after a shower : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
The grounds are immaculate and the stretch of beach that the hotel is build on is lovely for relaxation and swimming (with coral shoes, we are not used to the sand, the sea sand in South Africa is soft and firm) : [u'location', u'sea']
There are several pools with a great swim up pool bar to enjoy a few cocktails : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The dining area with the outlook onto the beautiful gardens with ducks and squirrels is amazing : [u'location', u'general']
The doors and windows did not stop the noise! You could hear every crying child passing around, and the annoying bang-bangs which suppose to be relaxing music starting also at 9 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Had a great massage by the beach : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Walks along the beach to the other resorts are lovely with many happy hours to enjoy : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
I was glad that Nusa Dua hotel has bicycle rental services : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
* Nusa dua is a place quite far from the rest of the island : [u'location', u'sea']
The facilities and activities for both young and old alike are very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If you are considering getting married here, do not hesitate and go for it : []
Some people have commented that sun beds all go around the pool, and yes this did happen, with people booking them early on but there were always plenty of sunbeds on the beach which was literally over the path from the hotel garden : [u'amenities', u'conference']
If you do decide to venture out of the hotel for dinner, head to the Tropical in Nusa Dua, at which the food was tasty and very reasonable : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Kids loved the pools and kids club : [u'overall', u'culture']
The bath tub looked old and a bit grotty : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub']
Breakfast was of a high quality : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Hotel staff on shore could not help AT ALL : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Aprilla in the kids room was lovely and so caring we just found that for our kids 7 & 10 it was too young : []
We got married within the grounds by the ponds, not on the beach : []
We had an early scuba trip on the check-in day, and there was no problem dropping our luggage with them as we transited from the first hotel : []
Waited 10 minutes for coffee : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Highly recommended : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
If you are wanting to just relax and are not into the rest of the hustle and bustle of Bali, this is perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Everything about this place is just wonderful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very nice place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We left the hotel and were feeling quite sick for the next hour : []
-On the beach the food is ok, but for dinner we definitely recommend the Balinese restaurant Raja`s with excellent food and service : []
One drawback for us was a family with children were accommodated in the floor above us which resulted in us being moved due to the excessive noise : []
Wifi in general seemed spotty in all three resorts : [u'amenities', u'internet']
After a very warm reception at the Palace Club, I was shown to my room; yes the rooms have been refurnished, but fortunately have kept the Balinese feel that I like : []
Therefore only 3 stars : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The seafood BBQ food was better : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We had our wedding here and every detail was perfect : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
A comment here though, we noticed a number of staff at the breakfast buffet with dirty uniforms : []
We stayed for 4 days and throughout the days, we were happy with their services : []
I did only give 4 stars this time where in the past it was always 5 : []
We visited Kuta, Seminyak and Ubud but Nusa Dua seemed so much more homely : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Most rooms have a balcony or porch for you to enjoy the outside breeze : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Its the position of this hotel (one of 6 hotels on the beach) that makes it attractive however even our teenage kids couldn't believe how long a chicken burger took, so we reordered it and timed it as a test, 41 min, But thats not important when you see the staff doing everything they can, in this instance, the 4 days the staff really couldn't be bothered except the management, they were lovely : [u'room-experience', u'view']
The upgrade included breakfast, both buffet and order off the menu, an afternoon tea with tea sandwiches and dessert- (although we never participated in this offering our son did and he raved about it : []
I just have one suggestion for the breakfast menu : []
I would highly recommend this hotel! : []
Very nice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had special check-in and check-out : []
The hotel has its own bank, tour operator, souvenir & clothing stores, taxi service & spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Fruit selection in breakfast spread could have been way better, and really leaves something which can be improved asap : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The Spa is highly recommended even if only for a message : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
good early bird special at Raja restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We would recommend to everyone, if you don't fancy all 3 trips you don't have too, we booked all activities in our hotel : []
We truly appreciated the careful attention we were given : []
Did not use the Spa but a visit there confirmed the overall ambiance of the facility in line with the rest of the Hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We did not eat any other meals at the hotel, because we either went to Ubud during the day, or to Jimbaran beach for seafood, or to the village outside of the Nusa Dua gates (Ulam seafood restaurant was nice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Maguro restaurant was fine the first time we went, but the service and quality of the food the second time was dreadful: my daughter and I could hardly eat one bite of our meal as all is seemed to be was fat, and trying to get the attention of our waiter was near impossible after a couple of Asian families came in : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Taxi's readily available for tours and transport around Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
In the morning we asked if it would be possible to get one a bit closer to the pool and beach and that evening we were moved to a room that was right at the waterside - the staff was very cooperative and willing : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The grounds are splendid : [u'overall', u'safety']
We had problems with the light in our room, we called reception and it was fixed within 15 minutes : []
The kids playground being upgraded while we stayed there gave our children less to do : [u'overall', u'culture']
All in all its depressingly sanitised : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We walked along the beach path up towards the point and looked at all the other hotel grounds and swimming pools : []
Your Customer care was outstanding and you all went beyond our expectations to make our visit to your resort one that we will never forget : []
The beach hawlkers were well behaved and not a bother : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
instead get a taxi from just outside the hotel and you will get it for a third of the price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This time we stayed at the NDBH for the 3rd time : []
We stayed at this hotel for 9 nights : []
Many rooms, excellent service, clean, bathrobes, nice linens, great bfast, helpful staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Able to relax and unwind by the pool bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
As during the stay very few activities proposed by a 5 star hotel, no smorkeling, glass bottom boat, pedalos etc, so not a a level of a 5 star : [u'overall', u'culture']
Verdict: Nusa Dua beach hotel is a winner, best stay in Bali! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We do not Like: : []
I do agree that the hotel show age (built in 80s) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
the rooms were just OK : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
If you are looking for a hotel with plenty of activities - then you might want to try sth different, since Nusa Dua Beach - like the entire Bali island - is a place to relax, not to make extra movements, not to watch time and to be extremely active - of all the activities on the activity list in the pool area none was taking place : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We paid a bit extra to upgrade our room and it was totally worth it : []
Staff are friendly but some should smile more ilke other 5* hotel in Bali : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We arrived Denpasar Mon 13 Feb after a 6 hr Virgin flight from Brisbane : []
There was a total lack of seating areas to the point that hotel guests were fighting for their space by placing towels and belongings down at 6am : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Employees there are lovely and after a few days I remembered the names of a few who I would pass, stop and chat to (Ery, Merta Yasa & Mushadi I am giving you my praise!) : []
my choice was limited to hotels in nusadua & kuta areas : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
3rd stay and again loved it,brilliant staff, beaches and food,had the luxury escape package this time- great value though not much variety in chess set lunches and very confusing trying to explain that we had paid an upgrade fee so our children were free- I think to avoid the confusion that they should have their own passports to be stamped and have the staff just cross out the massage and scuba diving that's not included for them feel non alcoholic beverages should be supplied at the buffet dinners as cost adds up when purchasing these additionally, rooms are becoming a bit tired and can be quite noisy, we were kept up by the guest next doors television on a few occasions so sound proofing isn't the best, another suggestion would be to add a pizza option to the kids menu, we travelled with another family and all of the kids were wanting pizza ( which btw the pizza at Sandros is the BEST!) We look forward to our next trip : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It has some fantastic restaurants on site and during our stay we had a fantastic 7 course meal in the private area at the centre of the pool - I can't remember what it is called in Indonesian now but it was amazing : []
The staff are mostly friendly, helpful and efficient, so the service level is great : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Overall this is a great hotel in the relaxing Nusa Dua area and the only bad thing about it is a tiny lizard came into our room at some point but it disappeared soon after : []
Our ground floor room was spacious with a large terrace : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We were there last year and stayed at The Grand Mirage : []
As for everything else, we got good value out of our package, but the overall atmosphere was not as good as it could be, ie, a bit flat : []
Personalised and fast check in, lovely peaceful club area for having breakfast where the staff called all of us by name (including the children), even holding the baby while we ate! The afternoon tea was brilliant, the cocktail hour was outstanding (comp drinks and big hors d'oevres for two hours?!), free juices and soft drinks all day, free internet access : []
My massage therapist was wonderful - a worthy splurge : [u'overall', u'culture']
This is a lovely setting overlooking a large pond and gardens : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Yes the inconsiderates of Europe have reached Bali! But its not that important : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Excellent beachfront location and we were not hounded by hawkers : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
A massage at the hotel will set you back about $90AUD : [u'amenities', u'gym']
As we were on honeymoon they do a romance package with a bottle of bubbly which my wife finally talked me into as I thought it a bit girly, glad she did : [u'overall', u'culture']
The countdown was similar to a Eurovision song contest : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The rest of the shops were boutique style : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We had our wedding at the Nusa Dua, and it was beautiful : []
Issue with this hotel was the noise in the rooms, especially from the rooms above and you can hear everything from people walking, moving chairs, opening wardrobes and dropping anything on the floor : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The location of all restaurants is good- dotted around the pool, near the beach front : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
There is also a restaurant if you walk in the opposite direction to Bali Collection (from the hotel along the beach), Kendi Kuning : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food & breakfast was good & staff was very friendly & welcoming : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The staff are very accommodating and willing to help you with anything : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Relaxing place which attracts you like a magnet wanting to come back : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I agree that the overall the gardens looks nice and there are several restaurants but for less than one day there we have paid more than for we have for at least 2 days in Seminyak! We have diner in Italian restaurant , order few things as we ware not hungry (only our 4 years old doughter was hungry) but pay as for regular diner! And the food was not good : []
There were several restaurants of different cuisine but the cheers bar had a eating area right on the beach which was a beautiful place to eat as the sun went down, with a walk along the beach after dinner : [u'location', u'sea']
Have been here quite a few times already and look forward to coming again : [u'location', u'sea']
that's until we arrived in our room, the deluxe room was small, not clean, cramped, when u sat on the toilet, one elbow hit the shower screen, the other the bench, it was tiny! the outdoor balcony chair cushions were saturated from the previous days rain : []
My husband and I always make sure that we go back here each time we visit Bali for Lunch or Dinner : []
It was quite hard and i think the mattress needed an update to a higher quality one : []
The grounds are amazing and brilliantly laid out, and the huge and interestingly shaped swimming pools are also lovely : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Outstanding value, highly recommended : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I've stayed in countless hotels and the buffet breakfast wa the worst ever experienced : []
Not bad the Chess restaurant, especiallz zhe buffet for dinner : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
it was superb : []
This was quickly sorted and we were given a room for the day and were able to upgrade to an adjoining suite on the ground floor near kids club as requested when the room was ready, which was perfect when traveling with 2 young kids : [u'amenities', u'conference']
) from Kuta if you wish to do some shopping and there is half day and full day tours by car and are plentiful and inexpensive, we greatly recommend a visit to tanahlot,a Budhist Temple on an island surrounded by water but accessible at low tide, the scenery is breathtaking : [u'location', u'sea']
Also if you do venture out of the hotel to find restaurants, many of the offer transfers to and from your hotel, which is great! : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I have to give my greatest appreciation for the staff : []
The whole hotel compound is nice, the pool is clean and well kept, restaurants are ok for dining (try the one on the beach, nice surrounding), the lounge bar offers some good cocktails : [u'amenities', u'patio']
they charged about 45 USD for putting plaster and ice on finger : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Anyway, I would recommend this resort to any and all who want a holiday to remember : [u'amenities', u'patio']
doesn't taste too well together : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They then hand us our keys : []
I think its nice place but not really recommended if you bring 4 years old children : [u'overall', u'culture']
Accommodation was very good : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
I would have no hesitation in recommending this as a wonderful place to go and stay on your Balinese holiday : []
Although it is spacious enough and kept me in a clean condition, the shower screen is tiny and as a result a lot of water ends up splashing on the other side of the bathroom : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff was great though seemed a bit overloaded due to the mad rush during the christmas time we visited : []
Nice clean beach : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
We stayed in Palace Club this visit and must commend the thought that goes into the extras available here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also my Wife and i got chest coughs ( Hers bad and still going) : [u'overall', u'culture']
Perfect room set up with two adjoining rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We were also very impressed to see the manager during busy breakfast periods assisting the staff in the dining area : []
We just keep coming back due to friendly service & great staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The size including the bathroom was good and was fully equipped : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Within the hotel there are boutique shop, a gym, a fun pool, night entertainments, lots of bars : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We stayed in a palace room, which came with extras but as far as the room goes is probably not that much bigger than a deluxe room, so next time will most likely book a deluxe : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
A wonderful resort property located in a very quiet part of Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We booked the palace club room which came with a lot of perks including evening cocktails and a separate breakfast buffet : [u'amenities', u'conference']
But further the management should giving us free internet access : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Excellent hotel and service breakfast overwhelming and by day 8 down to Poached eggs : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The seaside is very clean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We also walked up to Bali Collection most days for dinner or lunch - then caught the courtesy shuttle back : []
Overall we had another wonderful time and cant wait to go back : [u'location', u'sea']
The only person that was really helpful was the Head Concierge (we can't remember his name, it started with a S) : []
In their reviews other guests often report that Nusa Dua is lacking Balinese vibe, but we strongly disagree with them : []
The hotel has a courtesy bus that leaves every hour to go to the shopping mall, however we found it just as easy to walk there, the best way to get there being to walk along the beachfront : []
Plenty of choices for the children : [u'overall', u'culture']
The hotel is architecturally stunning in traditional Balinese style, but is some way off it's glory days with much of the hotel looking quite tired and a bit run down : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was our first time to Bali and it was fantastic!! We absolutely love Nusa Dua and the resort was excellent! Nothing can be faulted what so ever!! Easy access to everything that Bali has to offer! : []
Only a few mins drive to mall : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
Outstanding hotel to go with a family : [u'overall', u'culture']
Breakfast is served from 6 : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
It was more than we expected, we had a very confortable room at the palace club section of the hotel with all the many advantages : []
Plus as you can walk down the beach path to other hotels, you are only a short walk away from lots of other restaurants, some better / cheaper than this hotels, some not : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Next time I think we'll split our trip with some R&R in Nusa Dua, and a few days somewhere a little more convenient for when we want to get out and about : []
Room was very spacious and decorated in a truly Balinese style : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
so comfortable n relaxing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Because of many roadworks Bali suffers from heavy traffic jams : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
First time in Bali and decided to look for a minimum 4* hotel that covers return airport transfers, daily breakfast and preferably with spa services : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The place is highly invigorating for the soul : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel may not be completely to everyones taste but the rooms were traditonal and the customer service second to none : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
However it was an extremely enjoyable stay : []
We arranged 2 Rooms with the recent Luxury Escapes Package : []
We look forward to coming back and really hope that you continue to work with Luxury Escapes as it is a fabulous opportunity of promoting your hotel : []
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa is an enormous hotel complex right by the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We enjoyed the friendly, smiley service - the Restaurant by the beach was a bit slow but it didn't seem to matter in such stunning surroundings : []
Location is great and easy to get to Bali collections : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Would I go back - YES in a heart beat but I would only be happy with a premier pool view room as we love swimming and looking at water - I can look at gardens anytime : []
Lots of eating options within the hotel, although I must confess we ate out on all but one of our 11 nights as it was considerably cheaper and we wanted to explore : []
That was part of our honeymoon trip and the hotel really matched our expectations : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were lucky enough to be there when some turtles hatched and we were able to be involved in their release on the beach : []
Love staying here and looking forward to my eight time back in 2015! : []
We recently had an 8 night stay at Nusa dua beach Hotel and were pleasantly surprised with the hotel and the area : []
Very polite and helpful staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Then he kept coming up with other suggestions for us to give him our money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
They were able to find my paid services but it wasn't as enjoyable since I was preparing for a fight going into a massage : []
The facilities are great - breakfast is literally everything you'd ever want to eat : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
i stay in "club room" where you can have your own reception and free snack(will it's more than just a snack) and you took it in a privet garden with a beautiful lake, and its just for the guest who stay in this kind of rooms only : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The staff were very friendly and most helpful! : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There are the locals on the beach (they are not allowed to enter the resort property) every day, all day, to barter with for imitation Rolex watches and Bolle sunnies, baik linen & clothing and so on, which is a fun experience : [u'amenities', u'conference']
What made it worse was that we discovered it only after my wife slipped and fell on the floor after she got up to reach for the lights (to pacify the crying baby due to thunder) : [u'overall', u'culture']
The service was outstanding : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Took for the family for the first trip to Bali - three kids 11-8-2 : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
there is no free wifi in room (you have to pay for it) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For a couple, looking for a romantic beach vacation, Jimbaran or Legian are nicer : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
I didnt have an option of moving, as the hotel was very busy, and a ground floor room with a bath not available : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
From the first moment that we walked into the lobby the staff were extremely helpful and the decoration was stunning : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Stayed there for 3 nights and had a wonderful time : [u'location', u'sea']
Food: Very good quality : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
At a five star hotel I certainly think it should be included : []
Friendly resort for both families and couple : [u'overall', u'culture']
and there's a path leading upto a bale in the middle : [u'amenities', u'patio']
In 2 weeks we didnt manage to learn all the amenities in this wonderful hotel with exceptionally friendly and helpfull staff, gorgeous green gardens and pools, lots of architecture (unlike most others in Nusa Dua area) : []
Would definitely love to come back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
If you like to shop, I'd recommend to wait until you go into Kuta as I found the prices more expensive in Nusa Dua : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This was our first trip to Bali and we stayed here based on a friends recommendation : []
Mucked up our booking : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
as far as i was concerned they were terrible apart from a couple of bar staff : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This was our third trip to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and it did not let us down : []
It is quieter and beautiful plants lined the side of that pool with relaxing music playing in the background, creating the most tranquil atmosphere for total relaxation : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The location on the beach was very good (though we have been to nicer beaches in other countries) : []
Overall a comfortable and authentic place to stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel pools are both nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Not wet, not too hot, just perfect days : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are very nice places outside of the hotel where we could have a better meal, and with a much better price and quality : []
Beach bar food and drinks are good value and good quality : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Had ten days at Nusa Dua and enjoyed every minute staff are wonderful nothing is too much trouble,breakfast is excellent and varied,grounds are immaculate : [u'overall', u'safety']
There are different resturants that do a variety of local balinese cuisine and italian : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A suggestion for improvement would be to have a system allocating pool beds to everyone as it is a little annoying when people leave their towels to reserve pool beds from early morning until sunset : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
If you are looking for excellent service, this is the place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were met at the airport by the hotel and whisked to our room where cool crisp cotton sheets awaited us : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
View on swimming pool and a little bit further the sea : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Most of the hotel staff were very kind and gentle : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
When we arrived we were shown straight to our room, with lovely garden views and you could see the sea in the distance room 3215, the bed was really lovely and big,the bathroom had everything you needed,i must say that it had the best power shower i have ever had : []
It was amazing that we could spend 2 nights here in Nusa Dua Beach hotel, as a matter of fact, we really want to extend our stay at this beautifull hotel : []
It was our 5th anniversary and actually our 2nd true vacation since our marriage, so we called it our 2nd honeymoon : []
All in all, the stay was bittersweet : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Over priced but food ok : []
Walks along the beach front in the evening and stopping for a drink : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
The value for the price I paid was fantastic : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The rooms were large and nicely decorated with wood floors, wonderful amenities and very comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Beautiful grounds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Amazing buffet breakfast, friendly staff, comfortable and clean room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Servings are sufficient to be satisfying : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
They prepared a room close to the pool and the beach, as we requested : []
The hotel grounds are very impressive : [u'overall', u'safety']
(2) Cheap staff and it shows : []
The staff were very friendly and the girls at breakfast were great with the children : [u'overall', u'culture']
The location is excellent, right by the beach, with neighbouring hotels and the shopping mall only a short stroll away if you fancy eating somewhere different : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The staff here are so friendly, the Balinese are really beautiful people by nature and this hotel is such a great asset to Nusa Dua, I would love to stay there again some day and hope that we get the opportunity! : ) : []
If you looking for personal attention you will not find this here as this is a big resort with lots of rooms : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel is in a great location : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Stayed over 9 nights for doing some official works, I occupied a room and moved up to 3 times in different room, pleasantly! A great delicious breakfast -western and asian options available and a fantastic private beach with tranquil, warm, and glimmering sea water : []
pool was warm and huge : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Excellent breakfast and some nice restaurants in the hotel area : [u'location', u'general']
I am definetly going to go back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
My Recommedation is to book the club package - it is great value and the alcoholic drinks keep flowing in the cocktail hours : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Its beautiful, the fascilities are awesome and staff make you feel at home : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- The private beach does not allow local people : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The doctor was very helpful and gave us medication which relieved our symptoms very quickly : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I really highly recommend this paradise hotel to everyone : []
We're just counting down the days when we can return : []
Breakfast was a large spread : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Overall a wonderful week spent in Bali! : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
My wife and I can't wait to return and are literally counting down the days to when we would be able to return to this incredible hotel : []
We spent our honeymoon in Bali last month, September 2008 : []
- We arrange a one day tour via one of the hotel taxi drivers ( expert driver + brand new car) for about 50$, it was perfect specially ubud and rice fileds : []
Would recommended it for singles, couples and families and will certainly come back only for longer next time : [u'location', u'sea']
Turn down service of beds, and when this was down a quick clean and tidy of Bathroom with replacement towels etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Playground facilities by the beach to entertain kids : [u'overall', u'culture']
First of all, there was a security check point upon entering the nusa dua area : [u'location', u'sea']
More more Ubud or Sanur : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Only change we saw 14 years of staying at the Palace Club was a cocktail hour extravagent buffet to a cocktail hour of portion control : [u'overall', u'safety']
I will definitely be back : []
We stayed for 6 nights in a deluxe room and were made to feel so special from the moment we arrived : []
Unusual service : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Our Palace Club suite was well appointed and we enjoyed having a bedroom to ourselves for once : []
The street close by has a heap of great places to eat especially Tropical! Not the nappies girls working there but food is great! : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Thank you for the most relaxing holiday I have had in years : [u'location', u'sea']
We went to two shows, both were Balinese dance shows where the buffet meals were brilliant : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Even not having wifi in rooms was a blessing in disguise as I was able to switch off and enjoy the holiday but then connect at breakfat if I had to : []
I asked my kids what they really loved about the resort and they said that you could stay their , never leave and never get bored : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were looking for a holiday to unwind from a stressful 6 months (moving house/new jobs) and decided on Bali - like most people these days we researched the internet and came across an offer for this hotel through luxury escapes and decided to give it a go : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We have just enjoyed a lovely all inclusive 7 day luxury escape at NDBH&S in a Premier Room : []
The beach at Nusa Dua is nice - much the same as Seminyak/Kuta but without the abundance of hawkers : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The taxis from outside the hotel are easy to find a good vairety of restaurants outside the resort and far much cheaper with a varierty of selections : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
A tad pricey but with beach @ doorstep it was worth it : []
A lot of other dining options if you just take the beach walk that connects all the hotels in this area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Wifi was included in club not guest room, this was strange : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just look at the pictures! They will explain EVERYTHING!!! : [u'amenities', u'internet']
My only negative was the traditional dance shows : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
we felt that we needed to go out all the time to eat somewhere cheaper : []
Kids enjoyed the beach, swimming pool and the squirrels around the garden : [u'overall', u'culture']
All the stresses you carry with your luggage will be replaced with peace, harmony and complete wellbeing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Again, prices are higher than in Kuta where a Circle K is on every corner! If you are in Kuta, go to Circle K and stock up and save some money : []
There is lots to see and do in Bali, we hired a taxi for a couple of days to take us around I would recommend visiting the monkey sanctuary, some temples grand palace, temple on the sea, git git waterfall is nice, and also the volcano : [u'location', u'sea']
Nearest such detsination is about 30 min by car at Kuta : [u'location', u'general']
Bali may have many great hotels and this one is particularly great with good private beach, great restaurant and nice swimmingpool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Loved every minute of it : []
Thank you so much : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool was nice though not large in comparision to some of the others on the strip such as the laguna or melia : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The spa was great and very accommodating on booking times etc : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
If you want to travel all the way to Bali to stay in a bubble, this would be OK, but if you want a real travel experience, find somewhere more interesting : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast is awesome : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
For those staying 8 days or more, the Indulgence package is a no-brainer and fantastic value! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We enjoyed the evening cocktails with the club privileges, although if i stayed again I would not book the club as we found the day was revolved around 3 : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Buffet breakfast which is set by the most tranquil pond : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Just spent 10 nights @ NDBH and thoroughly enjoyed it : []
However, due to the size, the hotel has a lot of greenery and hence a brief walk in the morning after breakfast is always nice : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
It's not the cheapest way to dine in Bali but it is very convenient : []
Don't hesitate to book this hotel! : [u'overall', u'culture']
All the $40 bottles were not available : []
All have magnificant views either over the manicured gardens or the ocean : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
AMAZING air con and rooms, just great overall and would recommend to all : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed in a Palace Club Suite and absolutely loved it : []
all the facilities in hotel re quite expensive : []
I'm looking forward to come back and celebrate our anniversary : []
Nusa Dua area is 5* reservation, so around is no real life, you should go/drive out to see/try Balinese life : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
First time of staying at this hotel after many trips to Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
There is a private beach, just for the hotel guest, which is very nice : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Other five star hotels are just a short walk away along the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The hotel offers beach clean beach towels and sunbeds for free to all hotel guests : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
However, the downside was the bathroom -which every each shower the bathroom floor was flooded and the size was rather small for my expectation : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
The hotel is next to The Westin, The Laguna and The Melia Bali, you can walk, jog or cycle along the path to all these hotels and eat in their restaurants as well as our hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The location is idealic and my first impression was very good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are no flat screen TV's or sound systems, but you do get a DVD player : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast selection was fantastic with a wide selection of foods that was displayed in a creative manner : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I am surprise that when I asked for a replacement, it was denied : []
I'd like to espcially thank and mention my wedding co-ordinator Reni Aviantari for taking such good care of us and making sure our wedding was perfect! : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
Our room was upgrade & we had a king size bed & a private balcony the air conditioning was excellent for sleeping & although we didn't spend many daylight hours in our room it would be very comfortable to do so : []
And there is no distraction in the hotel apart from outdoor entertainments : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is a lovely pool at the Spa if you want some quiet time : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are pretty big but not very clean, there was dust on the floor : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Over all I would definitely recommend this resort and would stay here again if coming to Bali again : []
With a free shuttle provided : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Stayed every year since 1996 and never disappointed, this trip we stayed for a month : []
Entire resort is focused on bring you joy- from the plently breackfast, the multiple variaty program arranged every day, including special time for children : [u'overall', u'culture']
We loved it here and would definately stay again : []
Our room, 2014, was way back and in the cheapest category, yet it had an excellent bathroom, with a separate tub and walk-in shower, as well as a separate lavatory : []
The actual complex is very big & beautifully designed with lovely Balinese style small buildings dotted around everywhere : [u'location', u'general']
The rooms were well presented with a late variety of TV channels : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Bathroom needs some maintenance improved shower head and room tends to flood : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Our breath was taken away as soon as we pulled up to the traditional Balinese entrance gates and it just got better & better : []
The food in the hotel was lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Amazing place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We read most reviews and thought that it was a safe choice to go for, but sad to say how wrong we were! : []
Felt the warm fm the staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My tips if you want to save from spending, is to get metered taxi for transport (as mentioned above) : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The hotel is some distance from shops and restaurants, but it is worth travelling for the cheaper restaurants : []
The beach was clean & had plenty of shade : []
Everything about our stay was excellent from reception to beach, the hotel had a lovely laid back feeling The staff where very attentive also the entertainment was super our room was luxurious and well appointed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Room service was exceptional : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The pool gets busy very early, with loungers that must have been reserved in the middle of the night : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The entrance to the hotel is spectacular and makes a great first impression when you first arrive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel has amazing architecture with a touch of Bali in everyway with even the staff dressed in true Balinese attire : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I have stayed in the main part of the hotel on previous visits and have always been consistently impressed : []
We have stayed here 5 times and it just keeps getting better and better : []
beautiful surrounds, food and drink, flowers, sculpture, balinese entertainment, a good dose of local culture, friendly and professional service, and importantly we felt safe so recommend for families : []
Overall, I would highly recommend the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
on balance we would recommend this hotel for calm and great holidays : []
) The pool was moldy and pretty gross, it was very hard to find a place to sit in the shade and cocktails were also expensive and crap : []
Oh, and ya, we were upgraded to a pool facing room which was super : []
The Property is good, spa is excellent, pool is great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
I also asked for feather pillows and these were stacked on the bed on arrival : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
One night, upon returning from the disgusting buffet (charged $50, food was terrible), my daughter was so exhausted, just wanted to go to sleep, I open the room and find : []
cheers alan mcgill and of course the lovely Marie : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The grounds were beautiful and tidy : [u'overall', u'safety']
Nusa Dua itself is not very busy, which is sometimes exactly what you want! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
price is expensive compared with Kuta hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The walk to the alter was covered in petals, the flower arrangements were just beautiful, the musicians playing traditional music was lovely, as was the order of service, the cake was spectacular and all in all it was a wonderful happy day : []
We were lucky enough to assist in baby turtle release on the beach : []
It appeared that they were short staffed and although the wait staff did their best to cope with the extra guests it was a big ask : []
You can take a beautiful walk along the beach to the shops which again coming from Perth we found to be very reasonable, not crowded,not hassled, no traffic unlike our trip into Kuta ! : []
I was on my way to Australia for business and I had two days to kill so I decided to stop in Bali, did some research online and saw that the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa had some great reviews online : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This place has a great choice of restaurants, some of them with live music : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This time, after a multi-million dollar upgrade and refurbishment, we were delighted with the whole experience : []
D staff, food, rooms and hospitality was top class! We would highly recommend this hotel : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Arrived yesterday for a four-night stay and have been impressed with the level of service and friendliness of all the hotel personnel : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This place was awesome coming from a picky traveller like myself! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We enjoyed a meal at the pizza restaurant for lunch - yum - and with great service, too : []
Unfortunately there were a few things that I found very disappointing in this hotel : []
I am pretty uncoordinated but i'm pretty sure there's something going on here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed at this hotel for a quick weekend trip : []
Breakfast fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Would love to come again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
authentic place of Bali, in middle of touristic place - great entrance and nice stuff - but beach and pool should have mor local authentity - : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel; I stayed there seven years ago and really enjoyed it then, too : []
With young children we were still using a pram, which was not a problem at all as we had a lift just metres from our door : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
(Palace Club DEFINATELY worth the extra cost!) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Upon arrival we took an upgrade package which included a larger, nicer room overlooking the duck pond and beautiful gardens, ala carte breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails, all served in a seperate dining area (from the main dining room) overlooking the duck pond : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I have visited the other more modern hotels in Nusa Dua and I believe the premier rooms at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel are the most cultural : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Staff are terrific and cannot be more helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The spa was terrific and their staff very welcoming and efficient : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
people will have a relaxed start in the day and not that trouble : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Loved it! : []
Had fun walking home from restaurant one night, the sidewalks were covered with snails, big ones : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
00 for two for one cocktails and beers, which works out reasonable prices : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We took the SPA package and stayed in one of the suites on the 4th floor : []
I don't normally stay at resorts, it's not my thing : []
The atmosphere was very relaxing : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
in the morning!! How much earlier do you have to go to get such basic items?? : []
The accommodations were outstanding! There were many great food options with all the restaurants onsite and at neighboring resorts : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
When we arrived there was a bit of a mix-up regarding our reservation (two adjoining rooms) - Suasana stepped in and did a fantastic job of resolving the situation; we couldn't have been happier with what he did for us : []
We want to come back soon in the same hotel : []
Just hope they add a little more to their menu in terms of indian food or vegetarian options : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
A good place to be for those wanting a quieter Bali experience : [u'overall', u'feel']
It was also nice to be in a 'Bali' style resort and not all westernised : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The grounds in the hotel are amazing and the photos do not do them justice, perfectly manicured grass areas, with frangipani and bougainvillea all around as well as the cutest squirrels : [u'amenities', u'internet']
service was exelent dinning i was very disappointed with I tried 3 of your : []
The first 4 nights we spent in Seminyak as we also do business in Bali so by the time I hit Nusa Dua I want to relax and unwind : []
The swimming pools cater for everyone, and are large with lovely little nooks and crannies : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The location is wonderful and on the best beachside location in the area and we have experienced other hotels in close proximity : []
Steer clear of the market in ubud its full of rats : [u'location', u'forest']
The boy who runs the rec centre activities is gorgeous : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Other than that a nice allround resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The Nusa Dua Beach area was completely manufactured and isolated for tourists, so if you want western conviences (there is even a Starbucks in walking distance at the Bali Collection) and safety this is the place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My boyfriend and I stayed in August 2005 for 6 nights : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
EVERYTHING about this place is exceptional! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The clientele - started off well, good mix of couples, families, young people : [u'overall', u'culture']
But what I like it most is the price was not as expensive as others in that area which you can have a 5 stars hotel and direct access to the beach, because I love to see the sunrise in here : []
Restaurants- we ate at Maguro Asian restaurant 3 nights out of our 5 night stay : []
The hotel just looks and feels luxurious and you can spoil yourself rotten or lie back with a book : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
wonderful experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The main negative about our stay was the noise of the other guests opening and closing (banging) their doors at all hours of the night, very annoying : [u'location', u'sea']
Everything about this hotel is great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But I will choose this hotel again if I have another chance to come : []
I am happy to report we had wonderful cooperation from all hotel staff and our stay was a very pleasant experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And NDBH is just what we want! : []
However we found that the hotel was much more luxurious then others and i think was worth paying that little bit more, example; : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The Laguna is just that bit better in every way - breakfast, TV, guest services (ask the butler for anything, he'll get it!), but most importantly benefitted from newly renovated rooms : []
Hotel is big, beautiful, and excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
so this by far set the day up and allowed for a restful sleep : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Not sure if this a ploy to get tourists out of their rooms and interacting with each other, but it was inconvenient at times : []
We definitely look forward to going back again! : []
I was at this hotel in September 2008 for my honeymoon and it was a perfect getaway : []
We stayed at this resort because we bought a special on luxury escapes : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Huge garden around, calm and nice to walk/run promenade : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The spa was immensely relaxing, but it was annoying that my husband and I had to take turns to use it as there is no daycare at the spa and children under 12 are not allowed in the spa area : [u'overall', u'culture']
I'd advise to include breakfast as part of your package, the breakfast buffet is awesome with many options and cuisines : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We liked the serene privacy and tranquil setting : []
But one of the hotel stuff, Mr : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Subsequently there was another security check point before entering the resort : [u'location', u'sea']
The other impression is of claustrophobia : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Safe and away peaceful, ideal for families : [u'overall', u'culture']
50 Aus and it would be nice for the breakfast buffet menu to change regularly , but having said that the breakfast was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The restaurants for lunch and dinner, however, were kind of pricey : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Being next to westin hotel, they cleverly maintained traditional identity in costumes food and presentation : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We didn't try the other restaurant which had a very enticing menu - perhaps next time : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The food is top quality and the buffet breakfast is delicious : [u'overall', u'safety']
Thanks a lot for great Holidays : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The service we found was ok : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The pools are clean and they wisely have a very nice kids pool which tends to separate those who want to lie quietly with a book all day from those who need to burn off some energy : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Staff were caring always willing to go that bit further : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
No, but on a package deal such as this it is a delight and an opportunity to experience 4 : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
They have also a beautiful spa were we had a great massage : []
We prefer the pool/garden areas : []
Plus the spa / pool area was separated from the main pool / beach area : [u'location', u'general']
Welcome drink with fruitjuice n local arrack mix is nice : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Very hard to fault the resort, it seems like they have thought of everything, different pools, bars and restaurants all have their own ambience and vibe : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We not only had our wedding ceremony there but also booked a cocktail hour and reception for our small party : []
Overall a great place to wind down : [u'location', u'sea']
We were situated on the top level of the apartments in a standard room which was just gorgeous : [u'amenities', u'conference']
less expensive food and drinks in the hotel would encourage guests to eat more at the hotel instead of outside for example Bali Collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The service at the hotel is impeccable, u really feel welcome and the staff make you feel like an important guest : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Strongly recommend this resort which is the only one in Balinese style there : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The pools were nice, there was always a chair around the pool : [u'amenities', u'conference']
My room was just as spectacular as the entrance to the hotel itself : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I would highly recommend Nusa Dua Beach Hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing, sumptuous stay! : []
The only place where you feel the luxury of high class hotel is in the lobby : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The grounds of the hotel were beautiful : [u'overall', u'safety']
All guests were allowed to use the spa's pools, jaccuzi and steam room services, even though if you did not book any services with the spa : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel and it's surroundings are beautiful - well looked after and very clean : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The gardens are lovely and peaceful : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Restaurants are also walking distance : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
thank you so much : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We are two well travelled 80 year olds but could not find a fault with the hotel's presentation, its gardens and delightful personnel : []
We also enjoyed the Jacuzzis, there is 1 in each bathroom attached to our bedrooms : []
The air conditioning worked great, and I could get my room *really* cold at night if I wanted : []
Great restaurants throughout, free wi-fi at the lobby, super clean hotel, AND GREAT SECURITY : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Nice white soft sand safe for swinning even at low tide : [u'location', u'sea']
We didn't want to leave but we will look forward to coming back someday : []
I had a high expectation though regarding the staff and their services, I was looking forward for treats like wine, flowers or something to mark our anniversary (just like in other hotels) : []
It is the one with more green areas and gardens and beautiful buganvilles, other hotels could get too crowded but in NDBHS you get enough privacy and quite space : [u'room-experience', u'privacy']
The rooms and grounds are immaculate : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We have stayed at three of the hotels in Nusa Dua : []
the staff was very friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
While for us it was not a problem (my wife do not go topless), we observed that some guest were somewhat bothered with this; : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Mats are provided : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
The kids (5 and 7) loved the place and did not want to go home : [u'overall', u'culture']
Breakfast in the main restaurant is delicious and plentiful : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
This place was honestly amazing : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However, the sand was very unpleasant to walk on- not firm, with lots of broken coral, so beach shoes are a must : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The first day I moved in, I felt little bit dusty in the room : []
You get personal butler and those people do whatever they can to make it comfortable for you : []
Staff make such a difference : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Loved the Bali atmosphere ,the pools,beautiful gardens and the beach : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
2 swimming pools is also great attractions : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
After a mixup with our reservation we were shown to our rooms : []
The food at the hotel was awesome and very affordable! Breakfast was a full spread every day of a variety of local and international cuisine : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
From buying things on the beach to water sports : [u'amenities', u'gym']
I must say that the assistant manager, Dermott, was impressive : [u'overall', u'culture']
Some pointers though, the walls are paper thin, as you can hear the birds chirping outside, you will also hear the baby crying in the hallway or your noisy neighbors in the adjoining room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food: We paid for the breakfast for our stay : []
From sorting out the relevant paperwork (we are from the UK) to choosing the venue, flowers etc it was all easy, no stress and the beautiful grounds at the hotel are just stunning : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The sea was warm and clear but did contain a bit of seaweed debris, though not enough to spoil your enjoyment : [u'location', u'sea']
If you get bored you can perch in at the private beach area with a white sandy beach and crystal clear water : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Ok so the hotel is a lot older than those surrounding it but it had heart unlike the new sparkling sole less hotels : []
Best of the house was the kitchen, fantastic gourmet, excellent chef : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Restaurants were a little bit of a letdown in that everything was just average : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
We were taken to a 3rd floor family room, which had an incredible view over the pool; and glimpes of the gorgeous beach : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Blissful experience : [u'location', u'sea']
One of the highlights of the hotel is the spa and we enjoyed very much our couples' massage in a cabin that is way better than anything I have seen in European spas : []
We did eat out of the hotel a couple of times just for a change of scene but we didn't find anywhere that bettered the food and service at the hotel : []
We would come back for sure : []
But the service is little too slow : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I love every corner in this hotel : []
- Heaps of planned group activities available : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The resort is in a secured complex that lies within the secured area of Nusa Dua we felt very safe here at all times : []
We really knew that we had made the right choice, however, after my wife had a bad fall while we were exploring elsewhere on the island : []
The room we were given did not have a bath so we were given a larger room in the same price category with a sea view and a larger bathroom, so we were delighted : []
Free red bus to Mall and local area : [u'location', u'general']
Various room choices all of which have lovely wood features, carved doors and super comfortable beds : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Highly recommended - very spacious grounds, great features, gardens superb : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
talk about the best of both worlds : [u'overall', u'culture']
1) Nice landscape : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'patio']
The lawn and garden is excellent : [u'amenities', u'garden', u'patio']
NUSA DUA is a special area built away from the old noisy & crowded towns of the Region, which is Exclusive for well heeled travellers, with plenty of 4 & 5 Star properties, built around the wonderful sandy beach, looking towards Lombok, where the Komodo Dragons live : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'others']
The shower and toilets were always well cleaned with fresh supplies replenished daily : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
the other negative is that this resort the prices on food and beverages is very high : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Overall my stay is good except houseflies and if possible, more air-con area like in the spa room and dinning areas : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We only dined in the hotel once and went to the Bali gala dinner with cultural show which was great all set out in the large areana and open air stage they have : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Wonderful garden areas : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nice location next to the beach with good choice of restaurants although on the pricey side : [u'amenities', u'patio']
There is a supermarket in Bali Collection which is where I suggest you stock up on drinks and snacks, and also things to replace items from the mini bar : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I will recommend it to others : []
Facilities were perfect : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It's definately worth paying a bit extra to have palace club access if you're staying here for a special occasion : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was my forth trip to Bali-Nusa Dua but my husband's and children's first time : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Service was good and the omelettes and crepes for breakfast were delicious : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We also found the mixture of nationals to be good as well with Brits, Dutch, Thez Germans, Italians, Spainish, Ozzies, Chinese, France and the odd Yank / Canadian making it very interesting : []
The night before we departure I went to the counter before 11pm to get the bill : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Service gets a true ten out ten : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
But if you prefer a peaceful and quiet hotel with welcoming staff for your relaxing vacation, this hotel may not be your best choice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed in the Nusa Dua Beach & Spa Resort for 1 week in late July, and we upgraded to a Palace Club room : []
I lost my voucher to take free professional photography from the hotel : []
Beyond the aesthetics, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
After going through many different catalogues and destinations we finally chose Bali for our honeymoon getaway and we weren't disappointed : []
It is very similar to other 5 star hotels in locations such as the Gulf : []
The pool area is lovely with plenty of space and loungers in the sun or in the shade, also many chairs on the beach : [u'location', u'general']
Had great stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The most notable being Mai Mai- the food is fantastic and the service is great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
These are very big a spacious room, which was a bit of a waste for a person travelling by themselves : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Food and drinks - try the Chess Bar and swim up pool bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
50 for 1 hour : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
AIRPORT TIPS: Make sure you have cash to obtain your on site visa if you need it, they do not accept credit : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Fewer trees and less vegetation in general in the courtyard than in the other two : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
the entrance is so resorty look & resorty feeling : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
& bustle : []
I was staying here for work, actually : []
Beach clean and sun lounges available but don't expect clear blue waters : [u'location', u'sea']
On most other nights we would catch the shuttle bus to Bali Collection where there is many choices to eat at very reasonable prices also a supermarket for stocking up on drinks and snacks : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Our room was very nice and comfortable and we had good service from the friendly staff : []
The most beautiful resort,amazing layout,wonderful activities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There were 2 main pools in addition there were child/baby friendly pools, so expect some comotion, but peaceful enough : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']

The rooms were fantastic and clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
more of that later) and we had a fantastic view of the sea and the hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Good heavens how it has changed, judging from the drive from the airport to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
We traveled from the US West Coast for a short trip to Singapore (2 nights) and Bali (3 nights) : []
Overall I don't have a bad word to say about the resort, it is a perfect escape for couples or families : []
We walked the the "Bali Collection" shops one day to do some shopping and we were harassed by every cab on the way and then by every sales person at the Bali Collection : []
You can hire a minivan with driver for half a day (8 hours) for $40 AUD and they will take you wherever you want to go : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All staff were friendly, well informed and happy : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We have just returned home after our 2nd visit to this hotel : []
The room was magnificent and we were told that they are going to renovate them soon to make them more modern : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Numerous guests left the restaurant during the performance : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There were few people at the mall and the shops mainly junk although there was a supermarket, so for any better shopping or nightlife a taxi at about $8 each way would be required to Kuta : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Newly fixed swimming pool is nice, heard that Chess restaurant will be fixed next : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We upgraded to the Palace room which included breakfast, high tea, cocktails in evening, delightful staff - could not have been more welcomed if we wanted! The choise of restaurants was excellent from Pizza to Japanese to tradtional Balinese cuisine : []
We would would certainly recommend this hotel for anyone wishing to have a relaxing yet enjoyable family holiday! : []
The pools are nice, and the buffet is ok, some problems with fruit flies which can again be easily fixed : [u'amenities', u'conference']
You won't get better than The Nusa Dua Beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We want to go back there every year to celebrate our anniversary! : []
If you just want a relaxing holiday then Nusa Dua has that to offer and we found it perfect for our needs as if we wanted a quite night then we stayed at the hotel or if we where in the mood for a night out then in a taxi we would go!! : []
When we got to reception we not only discovered there is no such van but there had not been any transport arranged for us : []
His Staff has a special, personal touch to make everybody feel welcome and happy : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We stayed here for 4 days in April, and I have to say it is an amazing resort : []
We spent 6 nights there before transfering to the Aston Bali, which was such a disappointment in comparison that we left the Aston a night early to spend one last night at NDBHS even though our accomodation at the Aston was already paid for : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
As other people say, the beach is beautiful and the room is very nice with a good view : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Of all the power points in the room, 1 worked : []
The all of the beach are secure with security gates & surround just by 5 start resort & hotel : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This was probably the best hotel breakfast I have ever had : []
This situation make the hotel become a bit expensive for us who only have roughly 5 hours time to enjoy the hotel room in between the conference time : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Very nice hotel in traditional style, great people working there, great food : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We did not find the beach touts too annoying as they were not very pesky and would disappear quietly once you politely decline to purchase things from them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We just have one little problem : []
Good food although limited options for vegetarians : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The wedding went as planned thanks to Dwi who was an absolute star in making sure everything was perfect for us, we got married in the tropical gardens and it was perfect! The spa at the front of the hotel is stunning and very relaxing with a lovely lap pool and superb service : []
My family stayed at Nusa Dua Beach hotel on 31 January 2008 for a short vacation trips : [u'overall', u'culture']
Furthermore it was quite obvious that the hotel works with numerous travelagencies who seem to be offering last minutes as well, which was reflected by the general standing of the guests : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They offer paid wifi but is expensive by anybodies standards and talking to people at the hotel, was unreliable : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The resort is so beautiful, truly heaven! We spent a 6 day honeymoon there and took trips all over Bali : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Abundance of vegetation, squirrels, water, flowers, places for snacks and meals (though quite expensive compared to other hotels and especially restaurants in Bali Collection center) : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The pool staff were very good and worked very hard , in fact the hotel could probably do with a few more staff at the pool area : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Everything is Overpriced : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
kept and maintained perfectly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For me, this hotel is one I will quite happily return to : []
Each room has a balcony, so you can sit out and ejoy the beauty of the balinese landscaped gardens : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
i particulary enoyed the large pool to thoug access to the very beautiful beach is just as conveniet : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Especially because it was our honeymoon we felt it was definitely a great choice for our stay in Bali : []
Waiters etc felt like family, so warm and caring : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Chairs around large pool seemed to be occupied as towels were left behind but it seems that the people were not returning to them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Instead all they offered was 2 towels twisted into the shape of swans and a letter welcoming us and inviting us to purchase a seriously overpriced meal overlooking the sea : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We would come here again, but not to Kuta : []
The hotel is very grand and luxorious : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We also found a cockroach in our room and although this was dealt with very promptly, it would have been nice to have an apology or offered a change of room : []
On the site it seemed perfectly located as it was not too far away from the main shopping town of Kuta but enough of a distant so that we were away from the hustle and bustle of it all : []
The sleep quality was poor, the beds were comfortable but the noise from surrounding rooms and the slamming exterrnal doors in particular were a problem for us : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
I can't imagine how difficult it would be to get a massive Buffett for a hundred or so people right, and though the food was not perfect it was enjoyable : []
So we got a taxi into Kuta/Legian one night which was around $10AU : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The room was fantastic with gorgeous views and all your needs catered for : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The room & bathroom are comfortable & cozy : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
My husband turned 40 during the trip, and the hotel staff even surprised us with a cake and fruit plate! : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff are outstanding with their friendliness and level of service : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
As soon as one came out of airport warm & humid typical tropical air welcomes you, which : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It is a shame that you DO NOT get extra little touches like: flowers in room, chocolate on pillow or fruit by pool (unless you pay of course) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only improvement I can suggest is to expand the vegetarian food choice which was woefully limited despite the resort having a 6-7 restaurants : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This is located in a town called Batubulan : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Every day was spent at the pool/beach and we were lucky with the weather as only saw 1hr rain in three weeks although it did rain in the middle of the night a couple of times but won't count : []
We visited the spa for a massage session and facial, the staff are very good at what they do, they're always smiling and willing to offer their assistance when needed : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

Your fare will be half the price : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The price for the Deluxe room for 4 is so reasonable and well worth it : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Our room was large, clean and had a balcony with flowers growing on it : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Great location if you want a more private beach and away from the popular crowded beach areas : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The NDBHS was pretty standard for a Nusa Dua resort, very extensive grounds with lots of facilities, a little bit worn, belying the age of the place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The walk around the hotels is awesome : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Buffet breakfast had everything you needed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
ThankYou so so much for making my stay such a beautiful experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff and service in the Palace Club Lounge are excellent - it is well worth the upgrade, a big thankyou from "Mrs Julie" for looking after us so well, and the personal delivery of champagne to the room on our anniversary was a lovely touch : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']

The Nusa Dua was a nice hotel : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Food was excellent and we enjoyed a holiday that we simply did not want to end : []
The beach itself is not great, the sand stripe is quite narrow, and the seabed full of rocks and seaweed : [u'amenities', u'conference']
My new hubby would have liked a beach where you could swim properly - the water is very shallow, take a pair of water shoes and you can explore the shallows : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Eating in the hotel can be pricey : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This was our first trip to Bali and we didn't know what to expect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

what more could you ask for? : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were visiting with our teenage daughters during the school holidays and whereas neighbouring resorts seemed to be much more crowded and overrun with young families, we never had the feeling that our hotel was busy, as there is so much space to spread out : [u'overall', u'spacious']

The spa was incredible! We ended up going twice because the first experience was so good : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']

But then it begs the question why the hotel can't do them as well? : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The gardens are beautiful and well kept and the pools, restaurant, everything looks exactly like I expect a nice resort in Bali to be like : []
I am completely overwhelm by Hospitality of Nusa Dua staff, Hotel location is amidst lush green tropical sorrounings, its beach side Resturants with live music adds flavor to mood, : [u'room-experience', u'noise']

We stayed in a ground floor superior room looking out towards the pool area : []
Rooms are always clean, amenties incl water stocked up daily, beds tunred down each night : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The pool could be empty and you still can't get a chair as people leave their things there and then just come and go thru the day as they please : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The location and ambience is excellent : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We obtained a voucher in Australia for our accommodation that included breakfasts, some dinners with traditional dance shows, spa treatments & an assortment of other thoughtful & genuinely given (no hidden surprises) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We definitely would like to return to this hotel one day - soon! : []
You pretty much dont have to leave the resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I certainly only chose it for logistical reasons : []
We were promised a surprise by the receptionist when we checked in but nothing ever arrived : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the hotel and surroundings were authentic and pristine : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Resort facilities including swimming pools, spa, tennis courts, bike hire, massage were all very good, but it was hard to look past the problems in the rooms hence we probably won't return here in the future : []

Have just returned from 5 night stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our kids had a ball and we were actually able to relax in beautiful surroundings : []
Recommend to get it included in your accommodation cost : []
The restaurant food was a bit on the ordinary side compared to some of the good restaurants now on Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
This resort definately has the WOW factor : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On this occasion there was an unpleasent incident during the night by a group of fighting Russians and the management took immediate professional action and expelled the group from the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
In the morning the cleaning staff come at 9 o'clock with a several bell rings which seems very inappropriate for me for a holiday resort! Another problem with our sleep was the noise : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Bali is beautiful beyond belief but the people are also what make it : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Make sure you do some adventure activity while in Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel and it's grounds are beautiful and maintainence was second to none : []
But new electrical wiring, new air conditioners, TV & phones are great and working well : [u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']

Still one of the best hotel in Bali with real Bali Style : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Staff very obliging,can't do enough for you : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The highlight of our food experience (due to our short stay, we didn't try all the restaurants) was breakfast! Gosh, there was everything one could ask for : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
The food is great and service excellent - some of the waiters have been there since the hotel opened! The only negative we had was that our room wasn't ready so checkin was delayed which was a negative but I should have gone to the bar and not let it worry me : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
All the children were well behaved : [u'overall', u'culture']
When my partner complained to the Manager, she was offered a free 1hr massage : [u'overall', u'culture']

The pools and beach front where superb : [u'location', u'general']
It is a good option as the restaurant prices at the hotel are a bit high (around half price outside) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It doesn't compare to the Mulia or Hyatt unfortunately for similar prices : []
You don't hear this away from your room but it was slightly annoying at first and if you were to spend a lot of time in your room during the day might become quite the nuisance : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
My other tips is if you're planning to enjoy sunset, don't stay on this side of the island as there's no sunset here : [u'location', u'sea']
Our wedding was beautifully organised by the hotel staff too - I cannot thank them enough : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

We stayed in the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for 10 days : []
The spa treatments which were also included were fantastic too : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']

We needed to do laundry and the prices were sky high, so we took our clothes out to a local laundry service that cost 1/10th of the price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The next day, they asked me again about the A/C : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

My only complaint was very slow WiFi and not free in the rooms, I know we all spend too much time on our iPhones but it was useful for planning trips etc and keeping in touch with home : []
There is a tiny street area about 1/2 mile away that had a couple restaurants and a couple shops but nothing much : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
00pm for afternoon snacks, 5 : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']

com), and I suppose as you got the room at a discounted price you are treated accordingly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would have thought that there might have been at least one Indian curry on the menu in one of the restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Restaurant (expensive and very limited choice for vegetarians) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Lots of trees and greenery around you can take a walk, swim, play tennis, Table Tennis etc etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My partner and I were recommended to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa,by a neighbour and we are so glad we stayed there : []
In spite of loyally choosing the same hotel for the last 4 years, she visited us at Nusa Dua Hotel Beach Hotel and Spar and decided that our hotel was the only place she wanted to return to!

Look forward to experiencing the new bar/ eating area that is currently under construction : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
this was the most relaxing holiday in a beautiful part of Bali will go back again : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Service was quick too : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Top marks to management for this, in particular their choice of young Mertayasa at the Chess Bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The rooms are very adequate for the price, cleaned daily with a bed turn down and fresh towels and water each evening : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
Meanwhile our son got bored locked up in a crib and decided to protest by grabbing the crib door railings and start shaking it : []
I do hope the owner of this beauful resort reads this as he should be so proud of the staff he has hired : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Spa was the best I have been to and great value for money : []
I was covered up in a one piece and cotton top, and old enough to be his mother, so I am not sure why he behaved so inappropriately but it was very out of line : []
all the food was way too much western style and missed the Indonesian authentic taste : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
It is heaven lying in the private fragipani flower bath sipping coconut milk and listening to the birds, feeling the ocean breeze and then slipping on a soft cotton robe and lounging on a private bale : []
The ladies at the spa were wonderful and our spa experience was one of the best I have had : []
Location was great with one of the best kept beaches along the strip of hotels : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The beach is clean and well maintained and the hawkers on the beach were not intrusive : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
If you want to go shopping there is a free shuttle every hour to Bali Collection which we caught with ease (the shopping is only about 5 minutes on the shuttle if that) and the hotel also has a nightly market that sets up which is good for souvineery stuff : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Also if you want a taxi, do not get one from the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
He paused, looked at me in disbelief that I was making him go back to the bar for another journey and said to me, "I asked you whether or not you wanted ice or not and you said no : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
By most standards, this is a no frills 3* beachfront hotel that has great food, but a large number of rooms away from the beach and without a view : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This property is the best all-round place that I have ever stayed at, and as an ex travel agent, I've stayed in a lot of properties, all over the world : [u'overall', u'culture']
The gardens are in superb nic, and are the highlight of this lovely hotel : [u'amenities', u'garden']
My partner and I stayed at this resort in March 2012 and loved it! The staff are very friendly and more than accommodating : [u'overall', u'culture']
Spent a few hours in the Day Spa : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Food was nice but a bit pricy : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Advice: The only advice I have for this hotel and Nusa Dua area is, make sure you eat at some of the restaurants outside of the gates, they have fantastic food and are so much cheaper than the hotel : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I was coming out of the bathroom carrying stuff in it when i saw the door of the crib flies open downward by itself, and along with my son still grabbing the railings : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Koi fish in the ponds while you have your breakfast, the bigh kingfisher hungrily watching them and the squirrels scurrying along your balcony, everything just fit together : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Westin: Luxurious newer room, nice bed, room cleanliness BUT rude staffs in the pool area and pool bar only : [u'location', u'general']
Ethernet connection is available in the room for $16 per day and the hook-up is terribly slow and we needed to spend over an hour on three separate days just to get a viable line in order to do any business that required download of files : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Of course, being the first hotel on the Nusa Dua stretch (the property's been around for 30 years), it does not offer the same experience as the newer chains that occupy the same stretch now : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
At the "rush hour" to many guest are at the same time at the buffet : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The hotel is large and well set out with many rooms having great views of the pool, beautifully lush gardens and beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The rooms were beautiful, the view wonderful : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
If you're budget conscious, call yourself a bluebird taxi instead of using their fixed rate at the concierge to take you to the airport : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Visited the neighbouring hotels which are all connected by a jogging trail : [u'amenities', u'conference']

The best part is that the room was just perfect for a romantic honeymoon and something me and my wife can never forget all our life : []
After 3 weeks of backpacking in South East Asia, we wanted to relax on Bali and chose this hotel to do so : []
Nusa Dua is definitely the "other side" of Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Breakfast was so so, average, compared to those of other hotel/resort in Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I really enjoyed watching all the different birds visit and the ducks make the pond picturesque : [u'location', u'sea']
The room was very spacious and well maintained : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Excellent place for the kids : [u'overall', u'culture']

And the spa WOW, the most amazing treatments available for any type of day spa treatments : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']

Thank you Nusa dua Beach Hotel & Spa for making my trip and my families trip and eventful and happy one : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a lovely stay at The Nusa Dua : []
There is nowhere close to walk for lunch/dinner, so if this is important to you don't stay here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
and in case you missed it - recommended! This is by any measure a great property and a great experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Cant wait to go back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We had a Family Room (Superior Room) for 4, which consisted of 2 rooms with an interconnecting door : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The staff were fantastic and helpful in every way : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Dinning areas for breakfast was exelent and resturants were also very good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I didn't think it could improve - but it did : []
thus it was very hard to get a lounge : []
The hotel itself is beautiful, from the grounds and gardens, pools, beach and the details that have been so carefully attended to like little statues, carvings, ceilings and lamps : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We had a separate bedroom which was nice to go and watch TV and chill out whilst kids slept undisturbed : []
Spa good but over priced : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
We ate at all the food outlets on site and were happy with the food quality and service at all : []
It was completely magical from the stunning beach, beautiful grounds (gardens, ponds, sculptures), wonderful spa, fabulous restauarants - especially the Asian Bistro - and warm and friendly staff : []
I stayed here with my mum on our way to New Zealand : []
Kids were very happy with the pools : [u'overall', u'culture']
The dance, temple, everything was just stupid : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We loved the pool area - swim up bar, views of beach : []
The first thing we noticed upon arrival at the hotel was the enormous expanse of the hotel grounds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It became clear during this process that houskeeping/building maintenance are releasing unacceptable rooms to guests : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
On arrival we were taken into the palace club to check in where we were given a drink : []
Other gripes: : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
All in all a leisurely, beautiful stay at a hotel I would stay at again : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Hotel was located at Nusa Dua where its neighbours were well-known international hotel chains : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
As a result we had to leave the room instantly and when we stepped out it was even worse : []
What I love about this hotel is the hotel design & its has private beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
But i recommend not swimming : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are several restaurants in the hotel, good ones, 3 swimmingpools, a great clean beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Recommend for a relaxing vacation, bot for family or couples : [u'overall', u'culture']
5 hours until we became frustrated and asked to be told exactly when we could check-in rather than waiting around like lemons : []
Although we had bad expirience when we arrived - our room wasn't cleaned properly, had very bad smell of dumpness and we were asking for different room : []
Heaps of variety on the menu : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
My sister and niece who has disabilities really needed a break they thoroughly enjoyed your peaceful relaxing resort and we will all be back again : []
Nice breakfast buffet : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For those who prefer the pool, the hotel also has a couple of large beautiful pools, which are great for swimming : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The food was not very good at the restaurants but this was not a problem as we went out to eat : []
In terms of things to do, we really enjoyed the Night at Bali Zoo, which included hand feeding elephants, a tour of nocturnal animals, dinner and a show : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Still has good location on the beach which is great for kids : [u'amenities', u'conference']
A lovely area to have you morning tea! The food is good and so is the service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stopped to have a drink & sandwich at the Pirates Cove restaurant which was very nice & very reasonable : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Breakfasts were huge and buffet selection vast with the standard western fare and local specialties : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The food and live shows were a real treat : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
This was an outstanding holidays my wife and I really relaxed in a setting surrounded by an extremely friendly, competent and professional staff, the rooms are all excellent size and very clean, actually spotless with all amenities, it is our point of view that the value for money is also excellent : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Peaceful, relaxing and tropically luxurious : [u'amenities', u'garden']
I can't recommend it highly enough : []
The staff are very friendly especially "sofar" who is a young lady who ensured our needs were always met : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A special mention goes to Yoga who works at The Chess Bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
As soon as we arrived at the hotel we where greeted and looked after, didnt take long to be relaxed : []

Only 30 mins dirve from Kuta : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Rooms wifi has to be payed : [u'amenities', u'internet']
the breakfast selection was awesome the room we were in was great : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I would prefer Nusa Dua next time : []
They really didn't mind, didn't check and we were moved on to find our driver who was arranged from the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa to pick us up and take us to the hotel : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Prices were typically western : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The standard would be 31/2- 4 star, and showing its age in places, the rooms whilst very nice and roomy are somewhat dated : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- big breakfast buffet with more unnatural food - eg we tried guessing what juices we were drinking but it was so tasteless and artificial couldn't get close : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is nice and clean and the water was clear : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The club room also gives you access to the palace club services which is simply amazing : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Outstanding service from the time the concierge opened our car door until the time we left : []
The front gates of the compound were only a 10 minute walk from the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
I preferred the NDB Hotel because of a more traditional feel : []
We also found spa treatments to be much cheaper than in the hotel : []
We would come back : []
Their were renovations happening at the time but we never heard them : []
We had such a nice time just walking around the gardens and taking in the beautiful stone features and trees (with squirrels : [u'location', u'sea']
I would recommend the pizza restaurant (although it's expensive by Bali standards) : []
Even though not as impressive as other resort in the same area but was nice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool furniture is covered in mould as is most of the hotel (nothing that a good clean wouldn't sort) : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
After two days of tourist Bali (we'd also been lured into a very touristy beach restaurant in Jimbaran one evening), we met a taxi driver who seemed eager to give us tips on Bali's more interesting areas during our 10 day stay : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The landscape of the hotel is incredible and breath taking : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'patio']
The rooms were a little smaller than I'd expected but they were still spotless, extremely comfortable and had everything we needed so not a drama : []
The caring staff treat all guests as though they are old friends : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Transport from the hotel to the air port and vice versa should only be around 100,000 in taxi or private transport : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We would stay there again for 3-4 days of beach time : []
Rooms were large and A/C in January was adequate : []
Room: Extremely aged and dark from the floor to the ceiling : [u'room', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Our suite was spacious, internet was fast and reliable, and the fresh fruit was enjoyed : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We filed an "incident report" with management and never heard back from anyone : []
I think those few who would say different are either sour with life or don't know how to treat people respectfully : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
went here 1 year ago 4 business trip and i brought my hubby & daughter (15 mos) : [u'overall', u'culture']
Communication sometimes can be challenging : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We were pleasantly surprised to walk into Nusa Dua hotel and spa and be treated like royalty, we stayed in a palace suite which was beautiful, staff were our favourite in the palace club : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Totsl relaxation is the order of the day, friendly and helpful staff, clean rooms in great location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So, all in all, everything is excellent! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The food was fantastic but one thing they could improve on is the entertainment, overall it was fantastic to watch but there is no interaction with the guests, some dancing and games would have been fun! Overall I would highly recommend this place for a 'relaxing' break, ideal for couples and honeymooners : [u'location', u'sea']
The staff in the palace club lounge were all exceptional as was the rest of the staff in the hotel, cleaners, gardeners, security etc : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff at the desk were really helpful, always trying to accommodate my needs : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Thankyou Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for such a lovely stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bathrooms are a little disappointing : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The beach was cleaned everyday and the weather was perfect : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The best aspect of our stay was that we were permitted to continue to use the hotels facilities even after check out : []
This hotel is one of the best where i have stayed : []
The location of the hotel is good -- inside the somewhat sterile, but certainly quite safe compound of Nusa Dua, about a 15 min : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff were ever so kind, helpful and cheerful, specially, Ade at Raja Restaurant where we had our favourite table and ate delicious meals in the evenings : []
All the ladies in the Palace remember us each time we enter the club : []
A true 5 Star hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The gardens are lovely, the facilities and pools of a high standard, and overall we had a wonderful stay during Christmas 2012 : []

The lovely man carried my daughter to the hotel after falling and cutting her knee open : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The casual Balinese theme of this Hotel makes for a relaxing and stress free stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are a lot of beautiful hotels in Nusa Dua, this would be last on my list : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There were some equally good places to eat at half the price on the road leading into Nusa Dua - only a short well lit walk away : []
I could sit there forever : []
This is set in the walled community that is Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just a perfect place to relax : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The poolside staff also offered very good service They were ever-present and unobtrusive and appeared magically when you need to order drinks or food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach had plenty of lounges and a decent amount of shade : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Stopped over in Bali on my way to Makassar in Indonesia and ended up staying at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This is our favourite hotel in Bali and we have stayed there approximately 20 times so this can speak for itself : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We chose the right place for our wedding and stay as we though the other hotels in Nusa Dua area was too modern : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The Beach BBQ, which wasn't held on the beach, was fabulous, the food was great as was the entertainment : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
It is a gorgeous resort right on beachfront, and also in a gated community (so security is fantastic!) : [u'overall', u'safety']
Excellent spa facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Clean room, great facilities and services, friendly and knowledgeable staffs, peaceful environment and nice food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Do not go here if you want to go get wasted in the city as the hotel is fairly far away from most of the pubs and clubs : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
dollars for dinner every evening was a little exorbitant, if you like to have a drink or two on your vacation i would not recommend coming here : []
May be this is normal but here you are in the middle of nowhere and can't bay your own : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon for 7 nights and it was wonderful : []

There are alot off staf standing around in the lobby area doing at times just that standing around : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is one hotel where an upgrade to a club room is well worth it : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The pools are great : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Better off going to Bali Collections for a meal at one of the many restaurants there : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
You will get asked for further work by the taxi driver, but were did not have time for more anyway and he was OK : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

The lobby bar was a nice spot in the evening for cocktails : [u'amenities', u'patio']

right on the beach, close to markets and Bali collection shopping centre has a shuttle that goes on the hour and drops you at Bali collection and then brings you back : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The spa was great and we went everyday to their pool, hot tub and sauna : []
I have given cleanliness five stars but the bathroom was slightly shabby which did not really matter but a bit more deep cleaning of tiles, splash backs and the wood in front of the sinks would have been good, the rest of the hotel was spotless : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Indonesian, Western, Japanese food, an omelet bar, magnificent fresh fruit and juices, pastries, it really was a highlight - especially for someone coming from the UK where there is very little variety : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']

The rooms are always cleaned really well, although there was never a turndown in the 8 nights I was there, nor were there any newspapers daily or a list of activities which were always offered in the past : [u'amenities', u'conference']
If you are considering Bali and want one of the best on offer, book the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'overall', u'culture']
I will be back thats for sure and i wont forget how the staff helped me when i had problems there : []
It was our 10th wedding anniversary and the hotel delivered a flower arrangement of one dozen red roses and decorated the bed with 2 more roses, towel swans and rose petals, also left a heart shaped bowl full of rose petals and buds on the bath tub : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub']
There are a number of restaurants within the hotel : [u'location', u'sea']
We were upgraded for free at check in and it just got better from there : []
The later is more like a 7 star Hotel, so when I got to Nusa Dua Beach Resort I was almost upset : []
Loved this hotel from the minute I got there : []
PS; we have already stared to organise our next trip in Jan 2011and yes we are going back : []
I believe they had about 60% occupancy : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Very open, clean, and the perfect temperature : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Plenty of room, two bathrooms, two cots and rollaway bed in the living room which could be closed off from the main bedroom : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel was opened by then President Suharto in 1983, which makes it 30 years in service : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Yes this is the oldest hotel on the stretch, but with that comes character that represents the island of Bali; we took the opportunity to nose at some of the other hotels as we ventured around : []
Also based on several reviews on this site we had high expectations : []
choose the Palace Club room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We had a great time, arrived in time for a Balinese dance dinner, just walked in sat down and enjoyed the presentation : []
I would consider going back if I go to Bali, perhaps the hotel would do something about the cellular reception in the room : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
So relaxing : []
He came back again with the ice : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Only complaint we would have is that the pool is a bit warm , but that's out of their hands : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The sea was warm and shallow to swim in but did have a fair bit of seaweed as you ventured out : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pool area is really lovely : [u'location', u'general']
Staff cannot do enough for you : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It's beautiful, luxurious and the staff is very welcoming : [u'overall', u'spacious']
The Nusa Dua Spa is wonderful : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The beach is a good there : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
There are some important negatives about it : []
There are always friendly and helpful staff nearby : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The room had this special peaceful, relaxing atmosphere as if that atmosphere was emenating from the wooden panels, floors, well everywhere : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
My partner & I do not travel in style generally, preferring instead an authentic experience (that is mainly due to our limited budgets & means back packers & campervans & bargains) : []
The lobby is clean, staff are friendly, hotel looked nice, pool is awesome etc : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
5th, 7pm, the sea temp 27 : []
If you choose to stay at Nusa Dua, you have to know that you will miss the real Bali atmosphere but you will enjoy nice beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They don't advertise so make sure you ask : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Never had a problem in finding chairs no matter what time : [u'location', u'sea']
The complex has a number of tourist restaurants which are alot more affordable : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The water wasted on fountains and golf courses seemed ridiculous : [u'amenities', u'pool']
No bath in the room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Stay here if you come to Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only two dimensions of our stay that were underwhelming were the food and the food prices : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The reef so colourful, still healthy fresh coral with so many kind of colourful fishes : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We were awed by the world-class service provided in that hotel! The staff truly go out of their way to help make one's stay a truly memorable one, the food is very good : []
One pool has a swim out bar - excellent cocktails can be had here : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
This is our 4th visit in 5years,we always enjoy coming back to the Nusa dua hotel : []
In short we took your offering, : []
Food and drinks were very good and not as expensive as we imagined : []
Overall a great place for couples & families : [u'overall', u'culture']
Wouldn't hesitate to stay again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Lovely, helpful and always smilling : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- I tried to organise a full day tour from the hotel tour service : []
Excellent experience throughout! Would love to go back! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Will see you all later this year, : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you want to shop, the Bali Collection is close by : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Jonto speaks excellent English and has a very comfortable 7 seater : []
When I came here, I has some business with my partner, but I hope that was my vacation : []
If you do see him send him my regards, he was awesome driver!! : [u'overall', u'culture']
We have been doing lots of walking so that we can see all parts of Bali, it is interesting to see their way of life and to apprieciate the beautiful people that live there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Suite were very special, rain shower plus second toilet, your own lounge and kitchenette, two tv's, balcony and fresh fruit and towels daily : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Great spa service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Almost everyone would ask us our names and where we were from and would be happy to chat : []
We loved it and will be back : []
Everything is on hand - there's a huge buffet breakfast in the mornings, a nice selection of restaurants and bars in the evenings, and in between there's a good pool and beach to sit by and soak up the sun : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Our friendly barman in the pool bar produced amazing mango and lychee mojito's :) : [u'amenities', u'patio']
If you stay more days you really get sick of it, : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is beautiful and is only for the hotel guests : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The resort then moved us the following day and we received a two bed room with an ocean view : []
The happy hour (6-8) is best described as a social adjustment hour; excellent in every way : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The breakfast buffet was quite pedestrian : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The pools nice, the beach was ok : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I booked on a last minute web site, and breakfast was included, each morning it was great way to start the day with a full buffet breakfast, including fruits, hot food etc : []
For this the whole facility is too dated, the food variance and sophistication is too little and just many view little things : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Staff are very friendly and accomodating to our requests : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
from the Supermarket : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Prime location (On the beach), impeccable food (The breakfast buffet is superb) and service to match : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Breakfast was only average and other meals we had at hotel were ok : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The staff were very friendly and professional, we had a really great time and would go back again : []
When i am eating i dont expect : []
This is definitely the place to stay if you want the true Bali style atmosphere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room service quality was excelent at any time we ordered it : []
The two pools on the complex are not huge considering the number of rooms, but as the hotel seemed to be no more than 2/3 full whilst we were there we never found this a problem : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel has a free shuttle bus to and from Bali Collection where you can find many shops and restaurants : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Again - a 3 star delivery at the most, with deluxe 5 star pricing : []
Visited Bali in October and actuallly got engaged in this beautiful Island : [u'location', u'sea']
I can still spot dust at few corners of my room : []
This hotel is truly Balinese, especially in terms of the attentive staff with truly loving Balinese spirit : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
You can't even get a chair at the beach or pool unless you get up super early : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel has all the right amenities including, contemporary Balinese guest room, quality spa, private adult pool, pool beach food and drink service, Asian and Western restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Excellent location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
keep it up : []
The breakfast was VERY GOOD, they have so much menu choice from local to japanese : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This was our first time to Bali (myself and my wife) and we could not rate the Nusa Dua beach hotel and spa highly enough : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast spread is good but again not extraordinary : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
brought and taken away as we required : []
If you do decide to book this hotel, then do yourself a favour and spend the little extra on the Palace Club options, the service at breakfast is superb, there's no lining up at egg stations, everything is made fresh and brough to your table : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall a great complex with excellent staff and amenities : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The bed was soooo comfortable and the pillows were amazing! : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
But the problem was solved, after i talked to the housekeeper : []
It's like seeing Darwin's theory in action! : []
But this seems to be true with all hotels in Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Laguna: Quiet, BUT too quiet for some (my kids are too noisy there) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Staff are brilliant - very helpful and a pleasure to talk to : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
They started an probable finished renovation : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They all speak English and cannot do enough for you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However, the foods are only average and without free shuttle bus services : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Hotel is simply GREAT, we all oved it even our 18 months baby : []
My daughter just wished the fruit smoothies were available every day at the breakfast buffet!!!The staff were so friendly and helpful : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There is no surfing on this beach as there are no waves : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We were welcomed by a beautiful girl - sorry I can't remember your name - who brought us to our room and told us how everything worked : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Price is alrite, standard 5-star hotel rates, not as expensive as a few other hotels, but it does the 5-star basic right : []
Hotel breakfast was awesome : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
You can also stop in for a drink at the other nearby hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Good facilities at fitness center, great tennis court for very reasonable money - and the one which is dry even right after the rain : [u'amenities', u'conference']
However, the only regret was the raining when we spent the day in the hotel : []
Nusa Dua is very peaceful and a great place to just unwind and relax : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
When we checked in about 3 : []
The food at the resort is great and the breakfasts are probably the best i have had in Bali : []
My husband and I went to Bali for our wedding anniversary : [u'overall', u'culture']
Beautiful resort with very friendly staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff knew her well and she loved to see them each day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The entertainment was OK - female singer; and the fireworks were pretty good : [u'overall', u'culture']
All good restaurants and great location and facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
so enjoyed most of our days on the beach and in the water : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Only stayed here one night for a wedding and really wished I didnt : []
You do not need to leave this resort as everything you could wish for is here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We found the resort and the Luxury escape package exceeded our expectations for both quality and value : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We stayed in the club Place suite : []
Our room was upgraded & they decorated the bed with roses & swans (our honeymoon) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
It was our first time to stay in Nusa Dua and I don't think I will be back again : []
we had stayed from feb 7 to 11, felt it was quite less, you need at least 7 days out of which at least 2 full days in this beautiful resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great pools and beach area, such a contrast to Kuta : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
are renovating and hopefully it doesn't change the atmosphere too much : []
One real high point was the staff, wonderfully attentive, polite and very welcoming : [u'location', u'sea']
Lovely lap pool with lounges and seating around, Jacuzzis and cold baths plus showers and lockers available : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We were treated with great big smile from the staff, exellent food with multiple restaurants and plenty of fun activities : []
We booked a couple's spa on the last day which was absolutely superb : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The Melia seems to attract a lot more hawkers on their stretch of beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
generally staff are all courteous and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Highly recommend to anyone and will certainly stay again if returning to Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Great for weddings (we witnessed two) or special occasions: milestone birthdays/anniversaries : []
Great location and near shopping mall and shops : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
Looking to stay in Bali, this hotel is a must : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
And I wanted to have a good quality moment with my husband even only for few minutes alone so we asked our daughter to play in the Kids Club which is open till 5 noon,surprisingly she loved it and wanted to come everyday to join some cute,fantastic and rather educating activities there : [u'overall', u'culture']
The staff at breakfast operated on auto pilot and were very robotic - no interest in making you feel welcome : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We ate at the Chess restaurant, right on the beach, with excellent service : []
The helpdesk lady was very helpful : [u'overall', u'culture']
This area of Bali is beautiful! We were quite dissapointed with the wi-fi : [u'location', u'general']
disappointing restaurant and checkout services : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Sure the odd dishes were hit and miss, but there are so many good ones to select from : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We were upgraded on check-in, the room was fantastic with great service throughout our stay : []
Overall very friendly and nice people and good service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They did our washing for 2000Rp per piece (about 20 cents) which worked out less than 10% what the hotel charges : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Over the road from the pool was also part of the Chess Bar which had a seating area onto the beach for lunch or evening meal : [u'amenities', u'conference']
good for water sports : [u'amenities', u'gym']
(1) Each time you ask the concierge service to call you cab they "assume" that you mean a hotel cab which costs about USD 5 : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Thank you to all concern at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa and looking forward in going back, hopefully soon ! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast - good choice to suit most : [u'room', u'clothing', u'bathrobe']
I will make this short : []
Kids loved kids club : [u'overall', u'culture']
My kid loves the pool and was there from morning till afternoon while I could do sunbathing by the beach : []
If you haven't guessed I'll be going back for my 5th visit : []
For many nights, we asked the restuarant for a pick up for dinner, then just do some shopping and foul around in Seminyak, Kuta, Jimbaran, then take a taxi back to save one trip : []
We spent the most of our time at the spa lap pool, where it is serene and restful : []
Minor things I know but it really didn't detract from the wonderful stay we had : []
Anyway I meant to post this review a couple of months ago but it was only this week when we have booked our flights and accommodation to go again next year (we have never done that before) that I thought it was only fair to share our experience - it really was one of the best we have had! : []
As we had family who have 2 small children who wished to holiday with us over Easter we decided to choose Bali as the flying time from the east coast of Aus is only approx 5 : []
This is like a two stage facility : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool is beautiful and we all had a brilliant time in the all the pools : []
It was verry nice : []
I spent the day watching movies in bed but the next day I was up and about and ready for fun : []
Massage is good too : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The Spa and the relaxing pool area is to die for (Ask for big spa area for massage which is normally reserved for couples but is much nicer) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Don't get me wrong : []
We stayed in a palace club room which is well worth the extra cost, with a spacious room and excellent service enjoyed at the palace club lounge where the staff could not have been more pleasant or attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We are definitely going back, a wonderful Hotel and we felt exceptionally safe with the most update to security : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A place we would certainly re visit in the near future : []
Food excellent, facilities too : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There were hundreds of gemstones and silver beads to choose from : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Only tiny criticism is that the seafood at the theme dinners was overcooked, particularly the fish, but after all our dining, spa treatments and relaxing, that's the only thing we could say : []
The food has a lot of variety and the quality is very good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We will book again for next year : []
Pity there was building work going on at the time, but this is a small price to pay for such excellent fscilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Spa treatments enjoyable - special treat of muesli cookies and ginger tea at end : [u'location', u'sea']
Would definitely recommend! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
=) Will come again this coming Holiday ! : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
I spent several sleepless nights b/c the room was just too hot even though the air conditioner was on full blast : [u'location', u'general']
Our driver to Nusa Dua was very friendly and talkative, and it was a great start to the trip : []
The swimming pool is average but the bar at the pool does very good pina colada in coconut shell : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Wednesday night cocktails were a highlight : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
The resort is indeed a beautiful, 5-star hotel with very friendly Balinese employees, an activity desk, on the beach, an open air design, with an adequate gym and three pools, including a lap pool : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The location, the building structures, the grounds plus surrounds, the staff and security were all brilliant : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
2- The price of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks is ridiculously high : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
No free wi-fi in the room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The deluxe room is small, better take premier room because its larger, and good extra charge for that such big room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Found breakfast nice but nothing special : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was spacious with plenty of room for 3 : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
They add certain characters to the hotel : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
One lady from the taxi stand, who is supposed to be helpful, was in fact not helpful at all and not trust worthy, very bad attitude, gives a really negative impression about the place and people : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
swimming pool should be more clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Although this is one of the older hotels in Nusa Dua, the property was in great condition and the rooms were clean and well serviced every day : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
every were die empoyens hat time for a litel talking end there were very intresting : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Right on the beach but with 4-5 great pools : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Plus the air conditioner worked very well : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Check the guest photos, they don't lie : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
A cautionary note about arriving in Bali; we have always used the Visa Express service, however this is not available at the moment and our 1 hr 45 min journey through customs, with upwards of 2,000 other travellers was not a pleasant experience : [u'room', u'clothing', u'bathrobe']
First the room, very spacious with a modern spacious bathroom, the bed was high quality and very comfortable, there is a good size flat screen TV with a wide variety of international channels and free movies : []
According to hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
30 so I did not really get to sleep a lot on my relaxing holiday as I still have children that wake afer midnight : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The most outstanding thing about this hotel is the incredible customer service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also teh hotel has a transit area for those who cant check in early or have checked out and need to hang around for some time : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Maguro's was a bit hit and miss, but the waiter, Juni, was fantastic! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Palace Club deal gave us lots of extras, such as evening cocktails, table service at breakfast etc : [u'amenities', u'conference']
So weighing up that cost that is individual choice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach restaurant was under construction so there was some noice when you were laying at the beach and at the pool : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
(Note: Nusa Dua was very quiet in general, so the lack of crowds was not a reflection of the hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We needed a taxi to take us to the airport, and the concierge helped us call the cab : []
If it is an authentic Balinese experience you are after you won't be disappointed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Spectacular gardens, pools & beach, first class restaurants & attentive, friendly staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Internet not free in the rooms !! Thank god it was only 2 nights i booked cause i tried to leave after the first night & to get my money of the second but they refused so i left cause be4 our flight we need a good sleep & this will never happen at this poor dirty old hotel : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Breakfast was nice and there are a few restaurants to choose from in the resort : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
There's lifts at various locations thru the hotel : [u'amenities', u'elevator']
There is also a lot of lounges on the sand with only 1 or 2 people walking up and down selling their wares : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was very nice, simple and all you need from a hotel room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
good offers with the spa etc as well : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Good for family vacation as well : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
My husband and I had a great one week holiday in this hotel last year : [u'overall', u'culture']
The tropical gardens are beautiful and well maintained as are the lovely Balinese public areas : [u'amenities', u'garden']
We have just returned from our fourth stay at this fantastic resort : []
I did NOT expect this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food was very average with the breakfast buffet poor quality : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
and has a walkway path in which you can passby other hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
if you are looking for a quiet area this is the right hotel 4 you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff was welcoming, and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
06:00 down to the 50m lap pool at the Spa for 20 laps - for the whole 8 days I was the only silly bugger up at that hour and had the pool to myself : []
Thank you for your service, we had a great time : []
The rooms was nice, comfortable and clean but not as nice as I had expected for a five star resort : []
There was no bathtub and the shower pressure and temperature were not consistent : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
First - The doctors were extremely good with well spoken English : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
30am, and we visited the Restaurant varying times from 7am to 10 : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The service was excellent, however the strangest incident happened when my husband paid cash, the cashier at the salon did not give him any change, and only did so after he requested the change, he assumed they had thought it was a tip but still I don't think this is correct practice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The bed was amazingly comfortable and the pillows to die for : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
If you feel adventurous, you walk past all the beach resorts and move towards the public beach and some cliffs eroded by the ocean waves : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is beautifully located with a lovely beach and nice lawns : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Large and beautiful hotel with nice garden area and good pools : [u'amenities', u'garden']
We hope some day to return as this was our first but not our last holiday in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Expensive in Bali standards : [u'overall', u'safety']
- ok cleanliness of rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We also loved the pool bar as part of it is close to the kids pools that we could watch the kids whilst having a bintang or 2 : []
You get your beach sellers but they are monitored by the hotel and they are not allowed to interrupt your R & R time unless you call them over : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are also local souvenier shops outside the Nusa Dua gate : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Everything was excellent !!! All very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Perfect for almost everyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
became stickier every day, as they did not add new soup : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
But hey, they are renovating! Can't wait to stay in the newly renovated rooms : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Becomes a pain after a while no matter how much you try to control the water pressure : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
excellent breakfasts : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The check-in took some time but I suspect that it was due to the fact that we arrived a day late since we missed our connecting flight from Amsterdam : []
Meals at Chess on the beach also great and was lovely just to sit in the cool breeze and see the ocean : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Lovely vibe from the staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
So it is indeed much warmer : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The only let down is the level of service almost stay in the mid of 80s or 90s : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Despite this initial frustration, the grounds are beautiful and the pools are very nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
It's a good Balinese hotel but it's starting to look a bit tired, we have stayed here before and everything was great but this time the air conditioning was not working properly, some meals were not up to standard , and still no wifi in rooms, only in main areas : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
It was just another business trip enriched by a unique accommodation : []
I booked an ocean view room but did not get it : []
The interconnecting rooms are great as we feel we have plenty of space and privacy : []
Friends also used the gym which they said was good : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Just ensure you've double checked that the order is right before signing the bill : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Believe me, when it is time to leave, you just want to hide and stay longer : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
000IRP for 2 massages, a manicure and pedicure while the hotel charges 550 : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The down side is that it's rooms are a bit old fashioned and could probably do with a refresh, but that said they are a good size, have plenty of storage and the beds are very comfortable : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
I would probably consider the Westin or the Laguna if we returned to Nusa Dua : []
I stay at this resort on a regular basis (3 times a year), purely because it gives me what I need and expect from a luxury hotel : []
The rooms are fine, nice flat screen TV's and nice little balconies : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We used the gym and squash courts while here which were all well maintained : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Meals at all the outlets were excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The safe deposit box in our room could not be used and the wiring of the lights was faulty, flickering once in a while : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But you can simply avoid this by renting a motor-bike and exploring the sourundings on your own : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The air-conditioner is absolutely freezing; we had it set on low every time and at night you are always snuggled up deep in the blanks next to your other half! Speaking about the bed, the bed and pillows were a bit firm for our liking, but we never had any real trouble getting to sleep : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Not a big fan of modern accommodation : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
It's not an ideal location for seeing the rest of Bali, but if you're content to spend your time enjoying the resort itself you'll be very happy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very large, comfortable and clean rooms : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
It's a beautiful location and hotel, but for some reason I was slightly disappointed overall- hence the grade 3/5 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This happens either in the first or the second half of the day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Oops i forgot - they have got a lovely spa : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Well arranged pick up : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The Palace Club was just amazing every day with changing food and the service from the friendly staff was so nice I had a tear in my eye saying goodbye : []
the only downside was having to pay for wifi in the room and all water around the pool had to be paid for : [u'amenities', u'internet']
They took care their guests very well : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I love everything about it : []
We asked for a babycrib from the hotel since we were also bringing our 9 months old son : []
All in all a very nice holiday in a lovely hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel is quite impressive : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
after spending 3 nights in ubud (which was not bad at all) one would certainly be swept away with the massive and elegant layout of this resort : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I have been reading other reviews on Trip Advisor since March of this year and a number of people have complained about the pricing of food and drinks at the hotel and commented that one can eat cheaper outside the hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We loved the hotel though knew it was going to be more expensive than anywhere else in Bali, we were on our "babymoon" so didnt really mind : []
Watch the Ramayan show : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Prices for ALL activities are negotiable, so don't accept the first price they quote you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Towels were not changed in the room unless you dropped them on the floor, and if you forgot to do it, you had only wet and dirty towels to use the next day : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nice terrace where you have a lovely view of the gardens : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You truly know that you are in Bali throughout your stay with the various influences each way you turn : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast offered a wide range of choice and the "egg station" man is definitely the hardest worker of all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However, some may find that, the Nusa Dua area, as a whole,can be a bit touristy and artificial : [u'location', u'general']
Like all Nusa Dua hotel's it's not the "real Bali" and that's fine I've been there several times and didn't expect an authentic experience : []
Most of the rooms have a balcony with great tropical, either garden or sea views : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Best to order it steamed - has much more flavour! And only sour taste was upon departure : []
About the meals there is no buffet available and only three restaurants with a very short menu, the drinks are allways paid separately and are trully the hotel business, way too expensive : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I stayed here in the very first year it opened 30 odd years ago , was great to come back , rooms are a bit dated , facilities are a bit dated , service is FANTASTIC when its simple things , food at the theme nights was terrible to say the least , same old buffet style , cold , uninviting : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On the whole thought it was a great room : []
The only catch is that the rooms are slightly old, and Nusa Dua is far away from the tourist area : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
It retains the Bali feel with the architecture and is immaculatively presented : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
lovely squirrels and ducks : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
No wonder there were only a couple of people eating there each night : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Breakfast was great and plenty of it (a la carte as well as buffet if you are still hungry) - Western and asian/indonesian options available : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You can tell the rooms are a little outdated, but still beautiful and traditional : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We look forward returning next year : []
Will be back to bali again but will stay closer to Kuta next time : [u'location', u'sea']
The hotel was far cheaper than the Westin and many of the others, and i think actually presents very good value for money : []
overall the resort is very old and need to renovate rooms and pools area : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
We were 5 of us, including our little one who is 3 years old : [u'amenities', u'patio']
It was my 3rd time in Bali, and we absolutely enjoyed the time we have spent in this hotel : []
The bath also leaked and so after a shower the floor was completely flooded : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
We recently stayed there 5 nights : []
The swimming pool was fabulous as was the beach area : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
* room quite spacious, very clean, good view on the gardens : [u'amenities', u'garden']
It is Bali at its best : []
Definitely recommend paying the extra for the Palace Club Rooms : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The rooms are beautiful although some can be quiet far away from the beach (but close to the fitness center) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
and are already looking to book for next year : [u'location', u'sea']
There are plenty of English speaking TV channels if you want to relax in your room for a while (my friend was feeling ill so she spent some time watching TV in the room to escape the midday heat, and was delighted to find a live AFL game on TV : [u'overall', u'culture']
In my case is associated with holidaying so I just love it : []
Hotel was ok - nothing special : [u'location', u'sea']
My wife and 8 year old child recently stayed at this lovely resort and thoroughly enjoyed the experience : [u'overall', u'culture']
We caught a metered taxi back for just under 20000 rupiah : []
Highly recommended for a resort holiday! : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Nusa Dua is a nice escape from the ugly and crass areas around south Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
So, if our message is any way ambiguous! What else can I say? Its in walking distance of a Bali Central and another number of resorts - all of them offer a variety of dining experience that we didn't have the need to try : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
com for pics and Bali : [u'amenities', u'internet']
Food was very good but a little pricey : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
All were very modern, clean and perfectly maintained : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
And it was all top-quality, freshly cooked and frequently replenished : []
We have 2 small children and really appreciated the services of the Gecko Kids Club as well as the babysitting services available : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We kept going back to the Chess Restaurant because we were so in love with the staff - they were always so friendly and attentive : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The room allocated to us on checkin was not up to scratch with a number of problems one would not expect in a hotel at this level : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
It was nice to be able to walk along the beach via the pathway which goes all the way down to the end of the beach passing all the neighbouring Hotels : [u'amenities', u'conference']
My husband 40th Birthday was coming up and I could not think of a better place to go but Bali to celebrate : []
The atmosphere is relaxing and you can find the room and garden are surrounding with little squirrels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Maybe pay attention when you use the taxi counter, you can find cheaper ways : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My wife and I also had three one hour Balinese massages each in the Spa which were heavenly : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The welcome drink was pretty nice according to my friends and the massage also worth it : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
There is so much food available and they definitely don't scrimp on the serving : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I completed my advanced padi while I was out there and felt all the way that I was in good hands : []
bars and restaurants were more expensive than elsewhere in Bali but I guess you pay for the wonderful surroundings and location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We booked months in advance and requested early check-in, in a room on the ground floor with a view in a quiet area, not too far from reception : []
Mentioned this at reception, manager came out and moved us to a new room and upgraded us : []
The palace club and the palace club suite are fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Big lobby with nice unique architectural design : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Food at the various restaurants was good, I enjoyed the morning buffet the most : []
The property is shabby and does not have the "wow" factor present in other hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
many of the staff remember your name and were just simply lovely : [u'amenities', u'internet']
thank you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- bathroom door is very thin : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
The real wonders of the property are the immaculate gardens and pools : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is a bit dated but built in traditional balinese style and that makes it special if you compare to the other luxory hotels around this area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
At the pool area I intrude to scuba diving booths and start to learn diving & get the PADI open weather license : []
Will stay again one day : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The spa pool was beautiful and was always so quiet and relaxing as not many people seemed to know about it : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
the staff can not be faulted, ( the Balanese are a people blessed with a beautiful nature) and do every thing they can to ensure you enjoy your stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The service contained a lot of smiles, but nothing more : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Ring: 772406 for free transport : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This hotel is a great place to stay for luxury and relaxation at a reasonable price : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
location, room made our second visit more memorable than the first which was great hence our return : [u'amenities', u'conference']
All the furniture on the balcony was too wet to sit on : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'conference']
Stayed at a couple of places in Bali and would definitely recommend this one : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
You get your own Villa with small pool in lush garden setting with extras you don't get at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for $200 per night and much much better value spa ($25 US for 2 hours), food and drinks etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Wedang Jahe Breakfast restaurant set up : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
and then late evening : [u'location', u'sea']
Local women will walk around asking to give 1 hr massages for like $5-$10 US dollars : []
The beach sports facilities were not free, which was disappointing : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We have been visiting Bali for the last 5 years but this was our first visit to the Nusa Dua area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Grounds are extensive, very well kept and provide a place for all : [u'overall', u'safety']
The suite was more spacious and the living area and bedroom did not smell, however the bathroom was not as clean as I would have hoped and didn't smell very fresh : []
Restaurants offered decent food : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
To stretch the budget, eat at the market or Bali Collection, pick up some drinks and food from either Hardy's Supermarket or at Bali Collection where you can also arrange tours, have massages and do some shopping : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We managed to get a very good room rate, and it wasn't too expensive to eat and drink at the hotel (in fact we didn't leave for the whole weekend) and the quality of the food and drinks were excellent : [u'overall', u'safety']
If you like majestic balinese sculptures, waterfalls, marble floors, silk cushions, the best breakfast you've ever had, big amazing pools, frangipani oils, spas and great coffee then stay here : [u'amenities', u'garden']
It will be good when the new restraunt opens as it will give you more dining options which is a bit lacking at the moment : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The location was just superb although it could be said this isn't real Bali - at least the Nusa Dua brings as much Bali as possible to you : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The staff were super friendly without being over the top and intrusive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Ian & Lorraine : []
The hotel grounds are immaculate and very beautiful with various flowers and balinese style statues - and a lot of squirrels! The pool area is very nice with a pool bar : [u'overall', u'safety']
There are plenty of lounge chairs by the pools and on the beach, but you may want to save a spot early enough to have a place in the shade : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
just returned home last night, we spent 4 lovely relaxing days at the hotel, there was enough for everyone to do, my older son (13) went wind surfing, played volley ball, swam, played ping pong, squash, billiards, we couldnt of asked for more, our youngest just swam all day! at night its just a short stroll to some lovely restaurants if you dont want to eat at the hotel, we did do one night where there was traditional dances and baba guling, soooo delicious : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Endless popcorns for the kids in kids' club Pool mats moved to the garden for people having lunch picnic style : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Great sport, a lot of fun, lovely people : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A tip though - get a guide : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Bali Collection is only a 10 minute walk : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I've got the price where it is only $6 different than the Westin : []
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa was very nice overall, and a very good value compared to some of the wildly expensive (yet not that much nicer) hotels in Nusa Dua / Jimbaran Bay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There is no set price for these trips and you need to haggle with the vendor before agreeing to anything, further to this, on the trip we had arranged we first had to negotiate the tens of jet skies, powerboats and parascenders that have taken up the bay area north of Nusa Dua then taken to a so called turtle breeding facility that amounted to nothing more than exploitation of the turtle and many other animals for pictures that are kept chained or have their flight feathers clipped to prevent escape, kept in filthy surroundings and prodded for entertaiment of the visitors there : [u'location', u'forest']
Also walking distance off the hotel grounds are some great eateries : [u'overall', u'safety']
I would highly recommend this resort hotel for everyone, be it solo, for couples or even a business trip : []
nice beach in front of : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Great atmosphere and all staff very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The spa was great, and the treatments very relaxing, but they are resort prices : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
It was wonderful in 1991, it is excellent now, 2012 : []
We have just returned from one week staying at The Palace Rooms, located on the ground floor : []
The service was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Hotel restaurant food is exceptional, and surprisingly inexpensive : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The Palace Club gave us free soft drinks, afternoon tea and canapes and cocktails so was well worth the upgrade : []
The spa was just fabulous, from the treatments that were available (although it was surprising that you manicure/pedicure on the menu), the site away from the hotel was nice and peaceful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The deluxe room is cosy but a tad dated; the shower area is small but you can use the bathtub, bed is comfortable, tv's very small, air conditioning is great (it sinks to low mode whenever you exit the room) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
3) the mini bar is expensive (which they always are but there is no space to store your own water which is a shame) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Food was lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Some of the new staff are struggling and we did wait over an hour for food on 2 occasions at the same resturant, Chess : []
It beautiful i cannot fault it : []
We will definitely be returning to the hotel, Nusa Dua is a wonderful area and a cheap cab ride from Kuta beach : []
The room was then changed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We spent half day to explore this area and the hotel : []
Downside are horrendous prices i : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
In short , if you do have a penchant for genuine Hospitality , serene surroundings and want to laze amidst tranquility , Nusu Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is just the place : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The pools were stunning and the resort restaurants were lovely, in particular the breakfast restaurant was beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel's taxi is a ripoff, I paid A$8 just for a 5 minutes ride!! So if you're staying there just ask them to call a metered taxi to come pick you up, its heaps cheaper (only A$1 : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The selection of four different restaurants/cuisines to eat at was good - meaning we weren't choosing from the same menu each and every lunch and dinner we ate at the hotel : []
you could find places that have more reasonable prices but for where you are staying you could not want for anything else : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our stay over 5 days was excellent : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The location in Nusa Dua is great, the most picturesque part of the beach, some interesting small temples on nearby headlands, a few local shops along the beachfront as well as local market within easy walking distance : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
My fiance and I booked our room through the Agoda website, which was seamless and very easy to do, it took us a while to choose our hotel and we chose this one : []
I was here for five days but very busy with conference so did not even have time to go to the beach or touch the sea : []
We stayed in a Deluxe Room for six nights : []
The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You really feel like a V : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All staff very helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Clean and tidy, but nothing over the top spectacular : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The grounds of the hotel are clean and well maintained : [u'overall', u'safety']
We cannot wait to return with our children to this wonderful part of the world and stay in absolute luxury at this resort next year : []
The rooms are spacious and very quiet (garden view) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
On the down side, the meals at all the restaurants are expensive which meant dining elsewhere, most nights : [u'amenities', u'conference']
In a 5 star resort I believe that this should be included in the price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However these are just 2 of the many staff that went out of their way to say hello and made you feel welcome : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- Amazing sports facilities and air conditioned gym : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pools are lovely : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
This needs to be addresssed by the hotel as there would be enough to go around if they were controlled more effectively : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The resort was well maintaned and cleaned on a daily bases : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Our room was lovely but the bed was a little hard : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
There is also plenty of chairs to relax in : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The new bypass road to and from Kuta is fantastic, very few people are using it as it is a toll road so it makes the trip in and out very quick : []
therefore we have no tips or guidelines : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Last month I went to this hotel with my family of 2 kids and my older parents for 2 nights : []
The pool near the Gym,Tennis Courts etc : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The spa is gorgeous : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
huge hotelcomplex : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff were easy to communicate with, very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We finally found someone from the hotel picking up another couple and were transferred eventually : []
A massage from the beach was $10, a massage in the spa was $65 : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Ask hotel to book, restaurants will give you free transfer, but taxis are really cheap (IDR 20-25,000 ie $3 Australian max) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Just ask hotel to book for you, easy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- Hotel has sports and activities everyday (cooking class, yoga class, renting a bike, etc : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Well worth it Sad to come home : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub']
Beautiful swimming pool & zakuzi : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Is well equipt and every thing is available : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They did offer us a rental one for $15/day which we felt was overpriced : []
One of the outstanding aspects is the high calibre of the staff, they are very helpful, always welcoming and do it with a smile : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There is a shuttle to Bali Collections once an hour : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
The staff and people in general are all very open and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Selection is also excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
The property is gorgeous : [u'room', u'furniture']
The hot tub and sauna are separate for men and women : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub']
We changed our room to a premier one as a result : []
The service of the hotel was excellent, the staff was always helpful and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Her name was Supadmi and I truly have to thank her because she went out of her way with my family and our friends to make the stay memorable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach was great but the experience here overall wasn't really what I wanted for my vacation : []
5 hours in one of the spa villa at USD190++ : []
we booked a taxi from the counter for a day trip and a trip to a temple it was probably more expensive but thought we would rather pay a bit more and go thorugh the hotel : []
We especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet : []
Had a great relaxing holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
There is a good choice of food and eggs are prepared fresh anyway you like them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Meals can be a little expensive, good wine[Australian] VERY expensive, even from local supermarkets, house wine ordinary at best : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The open air lobby with koi ponds and lush green immaculate grounds, private beach, two pools and several wonderful restaurants make it so you almost don't ever want to leave the property : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The complimentary toiletries were not good quality : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in : []
Children would enjoy the beach and swimming pool : [u'overall', u'culture']
the spa is great and i would recomned a visit as you get so well looked after compared to uk standards i have exerianced : []
The grounds are just beautiful, there are very beautiful water gardens and the foyer area is very grand : [u'location', u'general']
We did not expect to receive all requests, but then we thought we may at least get one, but what was most sub-standard was there was no explanation or apology from the staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We can only recommend this hotel to everyone else who wants to experience an amazing holiday : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Also, there's literally no wave on the beach shore, which is probably good if you have small kids who want to play in the water safely and freely : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Had a great time at this hotel for our first time on this side of the island, normally at Legion : [u'location', u'sea']
I read another review that commented that this hotel had no character : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Wonderful staff and clean, spacious rooms : [u'overall', u'spacious']
We arrived at the hotel at 3am : []
Located on the most emjoyable place in place in Bali, Nusa Dua beach hotel is the ideal place to spend some quality holidays with the family : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Prices here reflected Nusa Dua in general, although we did discover that we could bargain at restaurants for free salad bars, welcome drinks or desserts : []
Clean private beaches : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff from management to porters are very welcoming and can't be faulted : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
All in all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
From the time you get out of your transport bringing you from the airport to the time you leave, you will receive a first class service from this hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very tranquil : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I tried taking the shuttle bus to the local mall but like the hotel the mall was a tourist trap with food prices the same as in the USA : []
The rooms were a bit small and bathroom was just ok : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Bed Room, Sitting area, private balcony, pantry and the toilets were very spacious and clean : [u'location', u'general']
We also ate at the Asian Bistro which was my husband's favourite meal during our stay : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The staff at both the Club Lounge and throughout the hotel were very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']

Our favourite was the full English breakfast and the coconut smoothies, the afternoon tea and the daily cocktail evenings made our holiday truly memorable : [u'amenities', u'shopping']

The restaurants in the hotel complex for example were - a pizzeria, a Sushi Bar, A pool bar doing burgers and chips etc - and were all mediocre at best : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The resort is large, with great pools : [u'amenities', u'pool']
It was very difficult to follow the story and the mc was very difficult to hear she needed to project her voice and use more clarity : [u'overall', u'culture']
Hotel room is large and clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Tour because we just wanted to relax : []
The staff are definitely what make a stay in this hotel stand out from others we have stayed in as not one staff member in our 9 days there did not smile and greet us or bend over backwards to accommodate anything we needed : []
There are ethernet jacks in the rooms for paid access -- too bad hardly anyone uses ethernet to connect to the internet anymore : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
but it is the spa that there is not enough room for me to rave about : []
Oh yes,one thing, as we were leaving purchased 3 small bottles of water from the bar area which cost us an absolute arm and a leg especially as up to that point all soft drinks had been complimentary as per Palace Club : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I highly recommend this property to stay in South Bali, once you are done in Kuta : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

except the food !! : []
It's a beautiful resort for a perfect holiday : []
The hotel staff were exceptionally polite and helpful and did everything for our comfort : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']

At aud$75 : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We had a fun time at this resort and would recommend this place to anybody looking forward to a relaxing and idyllic holiday : []

She told me everything she needed was at the resort and the staff made her stay very enjoyable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room service and housekeeping was extremely prompt and exceeded our expectations : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed in deluxe room at Nusa Dua Beach for 11 Nights 8-19 Aug : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We also decide to follow your bathroom interior design guys, just to remind us where we have been before : []
Whilst being a gated community away from the frenetic life of Bali itself, it had many of the characteristics that reflect Balinese culture, far more so than the adjacent hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only problem is traffic: to go from Nusa Dua to Seminyak you need to consider 30-40 minutes if you go at 17 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is awesome - clean and not at all crowded : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']

My wife and I spend our honeymoon at this fantastic hotel! We booked the palace club room, but at our arrival we were upgraded to the palace club suite! : [u'overall', u'culture']
I also enjoyed the sea there as there are parts of Bali that one cannot swim in the sea at the resorts : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The lobby bar is what it is but does serve a mean cocktail : []
About the location: Free shuttle bus to Bali Collection on the hour, nice supermarket an Frangipani restaurant was excellent, but this is more international than Balinese : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
- I'm not sure if all rooms were like this but we felt the floor and shower could have been cleaned a bit better : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Service and food great and the inclusions in the package were fantastic value : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I had thought from reading previous reviews that some of these hotels had much better pools but we thought the Nusa Dua Beach Hotels swimming pools and grounds were much nicer : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Good breakfast spread in the Jahe and felt good just next to the water feature by just hearing the running water : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
After that : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We enjoyed the 3 banquet meals at night especially the modern fire dance next to the beach : []
The accommodation is clean and rooms are large enough to comfortably house three teens : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
For the amount we paid and the facilities on offer at the hotel, i would recommend this hotel : []

Staff was so helpful and attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Very frustrating when trying to do some work! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We are from New York and this was a place for unwinding : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But the cost of providing wifi to all guests would be very expensive : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Our friend, Dermot, the resident manager went out of his way to make sure our stay was great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were very surprised at the security of the hotel : []
The hotel was well located and neighbouring towns were not far in the taxi : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Start from the very first arrival until the end of our stay, they treat us fairly or even better! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There are also some restaurants in the Bali Collection with competitive prices and decent food : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
A great room were arranged even i didn't make any request, so thankful to the resort management : []
The only down side is no wifi in your room, wonderful staff everyone as helpful as possible : [u'amenities', u'patio']
There were also 2 kids club lunch bills which I always thought should be FOC cos my kids eat from kids menu & it was always free from all the hotel restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Overall we all had a great timeand I particularly enjoyed feeding the fish and turtles in the resort foyer pond : []
Pool is really nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Where the Conrad had all sorts of water features, the NDBH has gorgeous grounds with beautiful landscaping and wonderful Bali features : []
Weddings are meant to be special and the best day of your life but all I can say is that if anyone is thinking of getting married here do not hesitate : [u'overall', u'culture']
The food was amazing in all of the restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The hotel bottel water was really expensive is around USD5 : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is like being in paradise on the Beautiful Island of Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel itself is 30 years old but we enjoyed the age, rooms a good size and the large lush tropical gardens are beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Great staff and accomodations : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Palace afternoon teas and evening cocktails are special overlooking a picture perfect garden and lake : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
food choices are a tad limited for indians and thats the one thing they can work to improve - though they are quick to get you stuff when asked , but nicer to see it on a menu upfront : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Thank you NDBHS, you really made our stay in Bali a memorable one! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I was extremely disappointed that when we got to our room there was only 2 beds for 3 people : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Beach and swimming pools are close together which is great if you travel with children : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed for 14 nights and never once was disappointed : []
Stay here if you like a quiet holiday with no threat of locals chasing you shouting "hey Boss!" : [u'overall', u'culture']
Will definitely be returning soon : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Stayed for 4 nights : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Everytime something comes up (bad TV reception, a bubbly toilet) the staff come over straight away and sort the problem out : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Totally different from Kuta : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
expensive drinks and food ,get on the free bus to the bali collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We were however , very tickled when we asked the staff who checked us in for an additional set of ' towel' and were promptly given a potted plant with a solitary and brightly -coloured 'flower' instead : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We had a beautiful corner Suite, on the 1st Floor, overlooking the pools & beach, we could have gone for a grand, ground floor Suite with it's own splash pool on the patio, which looked great, but we were very pleased with our choice of Suite, due to the view, which the ground floor one didn't have, as it had a wall around the splash pool : []
The hotel is located on a strip including the Westin and Laguna, both are very nice properties and having stayed at both are a step up from Nusa Dua beach hotel but do cost more as well : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I went for a walk one morning at 6 : []
Over all the staff were excellent and we did enjoy our stay, we would like to return there for another holiday in the near future : []
Our palace room was huge, with a large bathroom with bathtub and separate rain shower, deluxe room was shower only : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The service was wonderfully friendly and calm : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There was also a lap pool, however we didn't see this because it was in the spa area and this was being refurbished during our stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But you have to pay an extra 10,000 rupiah for the toll : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Almost like a boutique resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Had lunch a few times, food was very good : [u'location', u'sea']
we stayed about 3 weeks in Bali - and more than 2 weeks in the hotel : []
There are also souvenier shops : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The location itself is fantastic, extremely secure and a world away from the likes of Kuta : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our Thomas Cook rep Kasna was very nice and helpful and arranged some very good trips for us at reasonable prices : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Service was average, Once checked in the rooms and they were fairly nice : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The hotel was built in 1983, which is rather old - but it is so well maintained that it looks as though it was built yesterday : []
The staff are fantastic, especially the sous chef who does the eggs at the egg station every monring at breakfast : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We were not dissapointed : []
I recommend the lower level with your own stone patio walking right out to the gardens of the hotel : []
From the moment we got picked up from the Airport until we leave : []
Perfect pools with shade for the family : [u'overall', u'culture']
I would recommend this destination and would visit again : []
but hey, I ain't complaining : []
My wife and I stayed in a Palace Suite : [u'overall', u'culture']
It has beautiful established gardens and lots of Balinese character : []
Writing reviews has to be on the spot and based on your immediate experiences : [u'amenities', u'internet']
For example, Bali Collection, the outdoor shopping mall serviced by a shuttle bus from the hotel, is easy WALKING distance from the big resorts like the Westin and Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
All other things were good except the food, breakfast spread was limited (from the vegetarian people stand point) : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
If you are looking for a place to relax and refresh I recommend this hotel highly : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Resort: Absolutely beautiful - breathtaking : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, we should have looked into the Nusa Dua area a bit more before booking, it was quite bland and I think if we were to go back again we would choose the Seminyak area to stay in as it had great restaurants and atmosphere : []
Because of the sheer size of this hotel there are so many places to hide if you want peace and quite : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had booked 8 nights but only ended up staying 7 simply because the hotel just wasn't to our taste and we didn't feel that we were experiencing the real Bali : []
Our room was dirty, the bathroom had not been cleaned properly and it smelt a bit funny : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The desserts were outstanding : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
60 the same price as a soft drink I have stayed in 5* hotels before and never charged this amount : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff at the front desk offered us to have breakfast first while waiting for the room to be ready : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Perfect location set in beautiful grounds : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Very nice staff upon arrival, check in : [u'amenities', u'banquet']
The facilities at this hotel are fantastic, particularly with the pool in the spa area being a quiet zone where kids are not allowed : [u'overall', u'culture']
Location is also ideal if you want a resort style experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beautiful location excellent service beautiful beach location large selection of food for breakfast dining room in beautiful setting : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Staff are friendly and explain to us on how to get to the nearest attraction point : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Many waiters choose not to wear shoes - fair enough - but please could they treat their feet! Part of the lack of energy coming from the staff could also be that they seem to be older than the staff in other hotels around Nusa Dua (eg St Regis, Club Med) and less educated given their level of English : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
As part of the package breakfast, high tea and cocktails included, so worth the exta : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Best to get a driver to go into town or sightsee : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'bike-ride']
Gone sunshine : [u'location', u'sea']
Facials or anything else on the spa menu were discounted for luxury escapes people : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Excellent location within good reach of sites : [u'amenities', u'internet']
My room was decorated in fine carved wood, and while it had all of the modern conveniences, was well grounded in the local culture : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, with tropical plants, ponds, statues and carved stonework all adding to the Balinese ambiance : [u'overall', u'safety']
Pools were fine (although busy) and beach ok : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The staff are very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff employed at the hotel go out of their way to meet your every need : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
and it is a must hotel for honeymooners : []
It's a classic "pool and beach"-resort where you can hang around the whole day or entertain yourself with the usual staff like ping-pong, beach-volley, jet-ski etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stay from 14/3 to 18/3/2013 : []
The room was so spacious and the hotel is well run : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Upon raising a concern on the entertainment noise at night time with the Manager, Mr Saronca, we were relocated to a Palace room which was an unexpected but most appreciated : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Compared to the other hotels in Kuta the beach seemed very private and maintained : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We upgraded before we went to a palace room, which I very highly recommend : []
Resort restaurants are quite expensive : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Be careful with your money the lots of zeros gets a bit confusing and make sure you carry small notes with you as most places (in markets, small stores and shopping centres) don't always have the change, especially taxis we were caught out day 1 but now we know what to do : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pool facilities were lovely, and the hotel runs straight onto the beach so many an hour spent building sandcastles in the shade! : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
These palace rooms open to an enchanted garden on the first floor : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
The stunning temple at the entrance, large foyer, polished marble floors, water features, beach immediately accessible, and walking paths to nearby areas made it an impressive hotel : [u'overall', u'culture']
customer service is outstanding : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The beach wasn't amazing but it was nice : []
Breakfast is excellent and the huge pond filled with reptiles and fish and a beautiful Herron, surrounds the breakfast area giving such beautiful peace and tranquillity : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Warm welcome from the GRO Ms Nona : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Breakfast was brilliant : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
room air con should be more adjustable : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Do no expect to see the "real" Bali - but certainly a nice relaxing place : []
specially at balcon area : [u'location', u'general']
The hotel's staffs were very helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
No need to go anywhere else : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Therefore for me it is good to have a private beach from the hotel : []
In the early evening/late afternoon we had a two hours of cocktails and canapes : []
The best staff ever!!!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
my only criticism is that some guests would reserve pool lounges early in morning but not use them until afternoon : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
But most of the hotel staffs are very friendly and did their best to serves our group : [u'amenities', u'conference', u'recreation']
We really enjoyed our stay however if the food and drinks had been a better price we may have eaten at the hotel more : []
We would recommend the hotel though would be unlikely to return to Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They had lunch at kids club which was fine but the price of juices was the same as price of lunch which we found out about at the check out ( i think it's a little too expensive to pay for a glass of apple juice $5 AUD) : []
I did not miss a day : []
I have been to this hotel time and time again : []
I'm just marking the area that needs improvements on the part of this magnificent resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were most pleased with the every thing connected with the Hotel / Resort : []
The first price quoted by the seller is usually ridiculously high, you should pay no more than prices quoted above : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Unfortunately the only free internet is in the lobby area, so many tourists can be seen lounging on the chairs surfing the web : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We took a biking tour early morning and I must say our biking leader took us to few spots around the city which were wonderful : [u'amenities', u'conference']
My parents room had the same problem : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Spa facilities were very good also : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Nusa Dua is a very beautiful resort, the vast garden, public area, pool and beach probably made it one of the best resorts in Nusa Dua area : []
room was clean and had great views of the beach & pools & good gym area : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The paving around the pool were in some places very uneven and slippery one guest stubbed his toe quite badly on both toes : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I'd recommend this resort for those enjoyimg a beach holiday setting, but if looking for more culture and the real Bali head for Ubud and some of the amazing hotels in that region : []
The sand on the beach was very coarse although this might not be something the hotel can change, it was not a pleasant experience for me : []
This was fantastic hotel and the staff could not have been more helpful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We recommend the strawberry and banana pancakes with a mixed juice on the side : []
The rooms are cleaned to a very high standard by staff who seem to know when you're out of the room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Generally, I have good time : []
When you arrive you see an amazing Balinese entrance that is unlike anything else we saw : []
The sand and water were pristine : [u'location', u'sea']
24hour juices and soft drinks are also included : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They could upgrade the level of service as the upgraded their face already : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Bike ride 27km from volcano down exhillirating but choose bike carefully some in quite a bad shape : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Senior staffs working around the pool gives the dino hotel an old charm : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I'm not a massage kind of person myself but she absolutely loved it and came back feeling very soft and smelling wonderful (not that she doesn't always anyway) : [u'overall', u'culture']
Beautiful surrounding and service was excellent : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is the games room for kids and the spa for adults : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
This was our first stay in Nusa Dua and we found the location perfect for us : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Great place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We look forward to meeting up with the lovely staff also ,congratulions to all of them : []
Idyllic spot and a 'warm feeling' to the whole place that we thoroughly enjoyed : []
As we arrived pretty late in the evening on the first day, we decided to have dinner at the hotel itself : []
The food was very nice but on the expensive side and it took us a while to find alternative places to eat so we were hungry for a day! But once found there are plenty of alternative places within easy walking distance : []
Even basic items like mushrooms for your omelette run out : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
While this is a very good family hotel and most of the staff are friendly and helpful they need more training : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, if you wanted to hang around primarly in your hotel (and eat there or in other hotels in the area) it would suit you down to the ground : []
So, I have to go to the hotel's lobby for the free wifi connection and do my work : []
The beach was beautiful and the sand is very fine : [u'location', u'sea']
- agonisingly slow internet, available only in the lobby - surely this is unacceptable in 2012 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was our friend's 40th wedding anniversary while we were there and when I arranged a meal on the beach to celebrate, the customer relations staff arranged for their room to be decorated with flowers, fruit and a card at no cost : []
a nice little pool basketball area too which I quite enjoyed : []
Suggest, pick up tour literature at local airport : [u'location', u'airport']
Both my husband and I returned with the sense that we had enjoyed a real holiday - the first in many years : []
It was our 7th stay and it always feels like coming home : []
Housekeeping 2 times enter the room and realize that there is a guest inside the room : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The restaurants are very nice and they customise your food if requested, as we were Jains and do not consume even egg which was well appreciated by the staff in the resort : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The pool and beach areas are nice, there were some major yobbos around the pool, jumping off the pool bar so that spoilt the serenity : []
The rooms we had were lovely, spacious and clean : []
The food delicious and the prices very reasonable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Recommend this hotel to as anyone enjoyed our 8 night stay in the palace suite alot staff all very helpful and go out of there way for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We arrived at about 3 pm and were told that our room was not yet ready, and that we had to wait for half an hour, which was not that big a deal : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We stayed at the resort for seven nights in a Palace Club room from 8th to the 15th June : []
We needed to be close to the airport so decided to move from Ubud and have a couple of night in Nusa Dua - whilst there are more modern and flashy properties the service and style of this hotel are a winning combo , couple with good value rates especially for the Palace Club - a worthwhile upgrade for the money I beleive : []
As I swam in the pool, the champak flowers fell in the water : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The beds and pillows were great and we all slept well : []
Apart from the admittedly impressive entrance designed in a balinese temple style this could have been anywhere in the world : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff at the Club were very attentive & friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The only gripe I've got is small children being aloud to swim in the main pool, They have 3 other options to choose from : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Nusa Dua itself is quite an expensive area, so we found out : []
We were offered cocktails on arrival and met our hosts for our holiday, Gin (a wonderful and very helpful host) showed us around to the spa, in the direction of the pools and to our rooms : []
The grand entrance, lobby, breakfast area, the restaurants, the rooms : [u'overall', u'culture']

the breakfast was perfect too with so much to choose from : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The spa area is fantastic, the lap pool and change rooms weren't crowded, very easy just to relax : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Because they knew we were frustrated by the wait, when we got back to our room after dinner there were vouchers there for us to have a one hour Balinese massage each in their beautiful spa : []
The garden is beautiful, the room well renovated and the quality of the service excellent : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
It was HUGE !!! The main bed was a Super King size on steroids & the bathroom was very spacious : []
One of the best in a hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
One thing not to be missed here will be the Balinese massage treatment at the SPA : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is a shuttle bus that will take you to Bali collections every hour : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We bought a Wi-Fi card and couldn't access Wi-Fi from our room - had to go to the reception area to log on : []
We loved swimming at the beach and laying on the chairs watching over the sea : []
We never had to eat lunch during our stay : []
He acted like I had just asked him to massage my feet and spoon feed me by the pool side : [u'amenities', u'patio']
So you feel bad when go to a public beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
It takes a lot of time to travel from Nusa Dua to any other place in Bali : []
All the hotels in Nusa encourage you to visit each other : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
So after contacting the management 2 more times no resolution was forthcoming, sorry, that's not quite true : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The facilities were clean and very resort-feeling : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

The rooms are spacious with gorgeous view of the sea : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The beach is a 1-3 minute walk from the hotel depending on which part of hotel you are staying at : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast was great I like it, there's a lot even and I can ordered Benedict eggs ^^ it's so great to stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
We stayed in Nusa Dua after first scuba diving in Permuteran and then having a few days in Ubud, thereby seeing the "real " Bali, so when we arrived at the Nusa Dua hotel we were a bit taken aback at first by it being such a huge "touristy " resort ( beautiful decor ) We had booked a Deluxe family room with interleading rooms but they upgraded us to a triple room , at no extra cost, as they must have made a mistake with assigning rooms : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Great amenities: Free child minding service for our kids below 5), a lounge for resting with shower rooms and television (after you have checked out or checked in) and 2 kids pools + 2 adult pools : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you give a tip to a bell boy he will be very glad and thankful but in 5 star hotels this is your duty! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The room overlooked beautiful gardens and overall I would say I was very happy with my week at this hotel : []

I can't recommend this hotel highly enough : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our room was clean and spacious and I had a King size bed to myself while my daughter and her friend were given an adjoining room and their own bathroom( having 2 19 year old girls this was a relief for me) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A fully fledged games area at the Spa which is superb for adults and teenagers : [u'amenities', u'conference']

I stayed in the hotel for 5 days with my wife and 2 year old daughter : []
Darren & Lea : []
Especially those used to hotels in Turkey and alike will feel the difference in activities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Maybe outdoor speakers : [u'amenities', u'patio']
There are many shops inside the hotel where you may buy balinese Souveniers and other useful stuff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But, if you can spend a little, and are keen on visiting this touristic part of Bali, one could recommand other hotels in the neighbourhood, such as f : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

Good beach, very nice surroundings, very nice staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We enjoyed our stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We took advantage of the spa and lap pool which is the quietest part of the hotel complex - no children under 12 & we wanted a restful break so spent most of the time here : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Not sure why the other reviewers enjoyed it, probably I got unlucky? : []
The resort grounds as you drive in are huge and the foyer is quite fancy, not to mention the stunning view that awaits you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Plus points would be the pool and the spa was lovely : [u'location', u'sea']

Lobby cocktails very nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']

Efficient room dine service in day time : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
they had lovely breakfast and were very helpful with the kids and they wants of chocolate milkshakes, waffles etc : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I'm being picky but the bathroom situation, wifi availability and perhaps lack of too many local decent dining experiences stops me from giving 5 out of 5 : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
& not many veggie options such as veggie sausages : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
When we had the theme dinner at the hotel no water was supplied, we ordered 5 bottles of large water (normal aqua and they were nearly $10 a bottle, It was a shock when we received the bill) : []
Each to their own, I suppose : []
There is a lot to like about the hotel- beautiful gardens, clean swimming pools, friendly staff, our room was serviced twice a day which was fantastic : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Grat service that made us feel that we were at home : []
The location is great in Nusa Dua and not crowed like Kuta : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
overall a really good place to stay, impressed with facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The staff could not be more friendly or helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The kids loved the lagoon swimming pool with the sand edges , you walk into the pool as you would the beach and the sand goes for about 10 feet then it very gradually gets deeper just like the beach : []
I felt very lucky that it wasn't full because that would've made it extremely hard to get into the pool or into the breakfast area : []
The room also had issues with the wardrobe door that would close itself due to the track coming off and the balcony door you had to wrestle open : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And over looking the sea i would recommend relaxing in these tropical views : []
The hotel has a private beach which is also kept clean : [u'amenities', u'conference']
If you buy it at Bali Collection supermarket, you will pay over $20 still : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
For those travelers concerned with digestive problems, the offerings including the salads were all safe! The property is a welcomed departure from the usual five star resort, reflecting the indigenous culture of the Balinese people : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We were placed in the room overlooking the fish pond on the ground floor that has a spacious balcony : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The SPA was wonderful we had two treatments : []
It is available in your room but only at a price : []
WiFi is free in public areas but chargeable in room : [u'amenities', u'internet']
We shall be returning later in the year and look forward to seeing all our friends that work at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa from the management to the breakfast staff : []
We stayed in this Hotel with family for 5 nights : []
We will return! : []
The rooms are good, clean and functional : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
It is now the 4th times in 3 years that I staid in this hotel : []
The toilet was clean and had nice design : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
Spacey and plenty of options to choose for : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Beach is very nice but again seaweed in water makes swimming a bit difficult : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just the little things like the plastic beach seats etc : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
We enjoyed hiring the bicycles out, and we see so much more of the area by doing so : []
Dark gritty sand, dirty warm water and there were warnings about jellyfish & sea urchins : [u'location', u'sea']
However, the resort seem is a little old, maybe this is Bali style : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room on the ground floor was beautiful,clean and very nicely done : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The staff could not have been nicer or more accomodating : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Thank you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My husband and I travelled with our 3 teenagers and were given adjacent rooms as we had requested : []
Our 3rd stay : []
Overall, it was nevertheless an enjoyable experience : []
Very dissapointing as I take 2 o/s family holidays to Phuket and this could have easily have became my new fave destination : []
We decided to stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa since this area is close to the airport and we had not visited this area of Bali yet : []
We loved Bali, though admit we got a very sanitised view of the place as we went to louge around in the sun in a little slice of paradise - which Nusa Dua is : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We have eaten in two of the restaurants inside the hotel (Pool one and the Italian one) and enjoyed it both : []
Great buffet spread : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It has a selection of Western and Easter breakfast choices : []
Now I find out The rules have changed and I am no longer allowed into palace club because I have children : []
The outside balcony is not well designed, as soon as it rains you have to go back inside as the chairs get wet : []
Room was clean an comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
1, When we arrived bell boy not directly help , in the room he waiting for tipping is not good : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
There no need to worry if you wanted to shop : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I can't wait to go back at the end of this year! : []
The staff at this hotel obviously have great leadership as our every wish was catered for and they were outstanding in their service : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Many tried hard (the worker bees) but most were lost in translation : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Parts of the hotels are being upgraded but at a very gentle pace so as to keep disruption to a minimum : [u'location', u'general']
Outstanding service, polite staff, romantic pool bar and many other things will make You enjoy your stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The best part of the resort would have to be the beautifully landscaped gardens with the wonderful ducks, squirrels and bird life : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I did not ask or report mould as we were having such a great time in and out of the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Good breakfast with lots of choices : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Start with Tropical (0361 772046) Jimbaran Bay is a must to see the sunset at 6 : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Have Stayed here twice now and the rooms are really nice and theres always squirrels on the balcony when you wake up : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The bad was the service, the staff didn't really speak English, you had to pay for the internet in your room (and was flakey in the public areas), the stock in the room was at a minimum (running out of toilet paper constantly) and the walk ways around the pool were very slippery and dangerous : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Heard the odd grumble about prices in the restaurants and bars - frankly, if you want this level of service, surroundings and safety, there is a price to be paid : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There are some workers who clean up whatever is washed on shore : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our room was clean, well appointed & perfectly located, overlooking the beach : []
Would love to come back, but would hope to get a larger room for our stay : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The pool were very nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
It is a great place to unwind, enjoy the beach and Balinese hospitality : []
The spa area is a definite must-go-to : [u'location', u'general']
We stumble upon Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa from booking : []
HUGE peaceful gardens with fish ponds and water features,butterflies ,birds and bats : [u'amenities', u'pool']
There are 3 other hotels in this area within walking distance, we visited all of them : []
No evidence of bugs--did see a wee gecko one night, which may be why the bugs were missing : [u'location', u'forest']
This hotel really lived up to our expectations : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff were amazingly helpful & always spoke in passing making you feel welcome : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed here for 14 nights in March : []
Only fault, beds way too hard : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel host us for 6 days and each day was special : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa, and as far as quality and comfort goes, the stay was immaculate : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The squirrels were an unexpected favourite : [u'amenities', u'garden']
There was just no comparsion : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

all in this area : [u'location', u'general']
Everything was excellent except for a pharmacy emergency they didnt know what to do and kept transferring my call to the hotel shop : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We certainly made the right decision when we booked this holiday : []
We enjoyed very much! Excelente breakfast : []
Stayed for 9 nights and loved the place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We stayed 7 night at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa, the location was perfect for our first visit to Bali with young kids and no a budget the restaurant and events were well priced compared to other hotels around : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
- Large choice of food for breakfast (although if you got there late the bacon was like cardboard and some 'hot foods' were luke warm) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The breakfast in the Palace Club was very nice, the meals by the pool for lunch were actually very good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
ALL the staff are helpful and exceptionally friendly : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
It's expensive for what it is : []
The deluxe rooms are luxurious with the best space and king sized bed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Breakfast area was severely understaffed : [u'location', u'general']
We arrived back yesterday morning after the usual "great" overnight flight on Virgin, never again!! The Hotel is a haven from the touts on the beach and all the traffic that now chokes Bali in general : []
Not to forget, we also have the welcome drink at the lobby, which is also awesome to enjoy and start your journey there : [u'amenities', u'conference']
we also had someone inadvertently place purchases to our room but the boys at chess bar picked up, so u really need to check each day on your tab or pay as you go : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Do your research and go with your eyes open and you will love this place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They have 2 amazing pools with a swim up bar and you cam have a romantic dinner on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Truly Balinese (in the separated area of Nusa Dua), high standard : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The communal areas of the hotel and the Spa are well maintained and the gardens are lovely : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The Palace club itself is a wonderful concept and I highly recommend you splash out and try it for yourself : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We will be back!!! John and Pat : []
A short walk to restaurant ,pool and beaches : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There was 12 of us at the hotel having a family celebration : []
The room, the food, the spa, the sport facilities, the ambience were excellent : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
One more minor comment is the internet excess in the room needs to be improved : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The only saving grace are the staff which are very pleasant : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The daily charge for room internet is outrageous : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I don't understand the need for this when a shared nursary staff is more economical for the guests : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
As returning guests we were treated like royalty : []
The staff could not keep up with service and the guests were getting annoyed because of the time they had to wait for their drinks : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We would definitely recommend this hotel and would consider re-visiting this hotel : []
All the staff were very happy and always had a smile : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
However we soon worked out ways to get around this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We also had some great meals outside of the hotel : []
) So the folowing day we were asking to move again : []
What a wonderful combination of people : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
It's our home away from home xx : []
Nusa Dua is a great place to relax and for people that do not need to be partying all night long : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed in this hotel for 4 days 3 nights on 29/03 - 01/04, I would say this hotel met my expectation : []
We enjoyed our stay very much due to the efficient service n very helpful staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Deluxe room are more spacious & modern, with nice modern bathroom, however matresses were still very tough(felt like sleeping on the floor) & pillows were also lumpy, so we didnt have a good night sleep for 6 nights : []
Love its view, both from front (lobby) and back (directly to the beach) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The experience we had there will never be forgotten! And by the way, good facilities also includes awesome kids club; Gecko : [u'overall', u'feel']
A further visit will be on our agenda for the future : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Rooms lovely,position great, great staff, great food and walking distance to all other resorts if you feel like a change : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Nusa Dua Suite is one of the best rooms on the island of Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Chef Clark does a great job : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
huge resort located in Nusa Dua is one of the finest resort in Bali, which offers ample of opportunities to leisure : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Table Tennis near the pools was also interesting and much more used than the table in the sports area : [u'amenities', u'gym']
On weekend there are some noise due some kind of customers : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you plan to party and go out each night, you might be better off in Kuta or Legian, but fi you want five star service with each beach and pool access, it's a great option : []
The staff were always smiling and helping us if we got lost in hotel hahaa, the pool staff, the lobby staff, concierge staff, waiter and waitress they were very friendly : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
- poolside staff should be more available - you pretty much have to get up off your chair (god forbid!) and go searching to get a drink or a snack : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The mosquitoes were a little bit of a pest, so the shared bath wasn't as enjoyable as it could have been : []
The conference actually used facilities at the Westin and the neighboring Laguna resort, and got to see quite a bit of all three : [u'amenities', u'conference']
As others have mentioned, the restaurants/drinks in hotel can be quite expensive (compared to those outside) but we found them very good and we appreciated the proximity to the pool and our room : []
You can tell they make their own bases, my sauce had a stick of lemongrass in it, kafir lime leaf floating about and toasted coconut : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
and the prices were affordable : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The service was very poor and as for the english language skills well : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Great, staff were friendly and attentive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Each evening the canapes are based on a theme, which is really nice : [u'amenities', u'conference']
18th Aug - 2d Sep 2014 : []
Salted Butter delivered to the beach for unique guest : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Over a ten year period I have stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel on a number of occasions and always find it a great place to relax and just "chill out" : []
The swimming pools are great, large, and the artificial beach is very pleasant : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
We did have dinner a few times in the various restaurants in the hotel, the food is quite good, but a little pricey, in that is costs the same for as it would in the UK : []
The gazebo has a direct view on the beach, as well as the 2 individual balconies of our bedrooms, so we could enjoy each moment close to the beach : []
This might be a good hotel for someone but I dont think so! This'll is our second visit to Bali and after our first very good hotel this one looks awful! : []
can be ranged only like 3 stars,not more : [u'overall', u'culture']
Unfortunately though our room was not ready at 3pm check-in, offered voucher at lobby bar : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Spent a lot of time in the pool and had a great massage at the spa : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Have been to other hotels in Nusa Dua, but this is by far our favourite : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very freindly staff : []
This was a great day and would definitely ask for Kadek : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
thank you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Really delicious Balinese food : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The beach is however good and clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The SPA area is the highlight of the hotel in our opinion, in there we could relax with the wonderful swimming pool where you can actually swim, not very crowd : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I've never experienced anything like this in my life and believe me I do enjoy my luxury's especially on holiday : []
the lake beside the restuaurant with breadfast, it really decorate in a chinese style indeed : []
we likw to stay here again : []
- the noise proof of the rooms is poor, especially from the balcony and the corridor : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
Just outside the main gate, within walking distance of the hotel, are shops and restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
so I gave up the arguing & paid the bill : []
This resort is one of the first established but still holds its own in both facilities and definitely price compared to some of its rich cousins along the famous Nusa Dua 'millionaires row' : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
the next day, breakfast was better than I thought it would be : []
Our flight was later in the night so no issues with using the facilities or storing our luggage : [u'location', u'airport']
Have to pay for using tennis and squash court : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Everyone so approachable : []
Bali Collection: We didn't like this shopping centre : []
the check in was very fast & the rooms has good view & size : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Lessons to learn on food and beverage service to bring it up to 5 star : [u'overall', u'culture']
This included breakfast, afternoon tea (which comprised of scones, pastries, sandwiches etc), soft drinks and tea and coffee : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We wanted to stay in a 5 star hotel for our final night in Bali, and so my parents and us (plus 1 child and a baby) went for NDBH : []
Hotel, room, food and facilitates are top notch as expected in a Nusa Dua resort hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A good sized sink and mirror : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Other than that the resort offered lots of activities and various shows every night : [u'amenities', u'pool']
This hotel was suited 100% to relaxing in the sun as a couple or in small groups : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The kids club was free for kids over 3 years and the baby sitting was well priced for kids under 3 : [u'overall', u'culture']
The food was excellent at each restaurant and even by the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
To get there, you need to wait for a shuttle bus that pick and drop you up from and to the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We chose it because of the quiet location and the facilties, we were not disappointed : []
By Marlene and Alan, June 8, 2015 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Friendly, relaxed and great value : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
especially the palce club and the spa is to mention! people are nice and you fell really like in a drwm vacation! : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Very good restaurants : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast choices were extensive, and the tables were overlooking ponds with fish and water lilies to look at as you dine! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff were fantastic, so friendly and always smiling and greeting you : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Breakfast starts with a friendly staff welcoming you with the smile and ready to,help you : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
So we will have to get off at beach next to Club Med : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Stayed here for four nights with my wife, son & his wife for a long weekend : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The staff was friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Beautifully decorated, with a relaxed feel, would fully recommend : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I must say that the public areas of this hotel are very nice, the lobby, palace club and gardens are very nice : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
We are already preparing to book again for next year :) : []
so worth this option! : []
We had a few maintainence issues that were fixed within 60 minutes of my call : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However a night in Kuta is recommended to give a full experience : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Beautiful resort with lots of character : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Very nice stay overall though and would come again : [u'amenities', u'patio']
If it's good enough for U2 & Ronald Reagan (allegedly) it's good enough for most of us : []
Many thanks to you all who made our stay so enjoyable and relaxing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We went to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our honeymoon : []
After all we were there to be outside the room most of the time : [u'location', u'sea']
Returning to the hotel, I was told it was low tide and the boat couldn't make it to the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
During our stay, one of our travelling companions suffered a serious injury and required major surgery before he could be airlifted back home : [u'location', u'sea']
The hotel is a great option if you are looking to stay in a nice place but still feel like you are in Bali - a lot of the other hotels in Nusa Dua could be anywhere in the world and you wouldn't know : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Simply loved the place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However, the price was quite expensive but I guess that was normal since we decided to dine in-house : []
The lap pool/health centre/spa area is nice and secluded if you want to get away : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A shame that on our return to the airport they tried to save money and put six of us in one car, we got two in the end but the impression it left was not good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the food is nice it is in nusa dua area therefore it is secured and clean : []
It's a nice resort but a little tired and old : []
The bathroom was small (for 3 adult) but it runs well : []
Also not many vegetables for breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We enjoyed our 4 days stay after having our holydays spent on a tour through Sumatra & Java in te Nusa Dua hotel and spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Only other downer, not hotel's fault, but there was construction work under way somewhere in Nusa Dua with pile driving happening all day, it did stop just on dusk : []
This is a hotel we would recommend and use again with a proviso : []
The cold towels that were provided when we checked in were great : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens', u'bathrobe', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
My room is a little far from the lobby, but it enables me to see the beautiful scenery sorround the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The scented celebration is highly recommended : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Bar is not lively at all when I was there : []
Our friends and especially the children however liked it more at Nusa Dua - more things happening around the hotel area! : [u'overall', u'culture']
Thin crisp crust, not too much topping and quality ingredients : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Maybe compared with 3 yrs ago everything was a bit less but still ok and worth the extra money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I would highly recommend this resort to everyone : []
there are multiple options to dine-in inside the property : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Room service was excellent as was the hospitality of all staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Service was good, although I was a bit annoyed that they wanted us to pay for a late checkout; after a one-week stay and a generous tab that we'd run up I think they could have spotted us the room as a general 'thanks' : []
Following day we enjoyed the "Nusa Dua Explosion" from the pool bar : []
The free shuttle hourly ran from the Hotel is another great time filler to the Bali Connection, similar to a western shopping mall is open aired, Soho store is air-conditioned with a Star Bucks if craving a real coffee : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Alternatively, get the hotel to organise a car to take you to cafe Surya - 20 mins down the road in Tanjong Benoa : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
To my surprise, i was given the newly renovated room, and boy it look nice!!! I'll just skip the standards and go to the points where the hotel stands out : []
The food and service Manager goes beyond the call of duty and all the other Mangers and staff are so helpful a huge huge thankyou, I have had so much stress in my life, your kindness empathy has truely brought me to tears : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel management run a tight and very efficient ship : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Overall, a fantastic relaxing holiday but don't expect the real Bali here as you are isolated from reality : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I stayed with my 2 sisters for 5 nights : []
We had pizza by the gorgeous pool a couple of times and it was really good : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Unfortunately , the music is allowed to go on close to twelve o'clock : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
My husband and I stayed at the NDB Hotel and Spa for 5 nights in March 2006 : [u'overall', u'culture']
The hotel also provides a buffet breakfast which was fabulous with made to order eggs and omelettes, plenty variety of pastries, cereals, fruit ,yoghurts it caters for everyones taste : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beaches are superbly clean with lovely white sand : [u'location', u'sea']
With a full hot and cold menu, the freshest of fruits, cereals, yogurts, bircher muesli, Eggs any style, pancakes & waffles for the kids (Don't go on a diet here) : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
There is no internet in the rooms, but it is available at the business centre for a fee : []
We cant wait for our return trip : []
we bought a package deal online for 2adults and 2 kids, which was good value for a total of 16nights at Nusa Dua Beach Resort : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The room we had was a little disappointing- nowhere comfortable to sit inside : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff is very helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
BUT DO NOT STAY HERE IF COMING AS COUPLES, rooms are dated and service relatively slow : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The Fitness Centre was never crowded and there are three pools to choose from : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The staff at the Palace Club and throughout the resort are simply wonderful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Overcame by purchasing a local sim card for my ipad : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We're celebrating our 40thanniversary & was the best place : []
The afternoon tea is obviously western but a great treat : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We loved how quiet, calm and peaceful the beachfront was : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed as part of a package offered by Luxury escapes : [u'amenities', u'conference']
2-3 very nice ladies would staff it : [u'overall', u'culture']
There are also several restaurants and the atmosphere at night is very relaxed and is a good cheap place to dine out : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The room, we stayed in deluxe room and it is huge : []
Complimentary bottled water was replaced every day : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The entrance to the hotel and lobby are impressive : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
I'll be back : []
Stop at a mini market and get extra water and treats before going to your hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We liked Nusa Dua Beach hotel and Nikko Bali hotel the most out of all the offered hotels in travel agency catalogues : []
Easy access to local restaurants, shops, free shuttle to shopping mall : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
We can't wait to come back again : []
There is shuttle bus service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
on the reef : [u'location', u'sea']
When we went out on the verandah we overlooked a fire hydrant and the exhaust fans from the adjacent hotet which wasn't very pleasant : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We have since been holidaying in other Asian countries up to 3 times per year : []
My only negative would be the kids club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Most impressive so far has been the Palace Club : []
Prices for drinks are pretty high, but in comparison to Belgium, almost the same but compared to other places in Bali, pretty high : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
If i had to go back to Bali again one day i would definitely be staying here at Nusa Dua beach Hotel & Spa : []
You get used to it, but you don't enjoy it so much : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We have been to Bali eight times and have tried other 5 Star hotels in Nusa Dua however none have even come close to matching the experience we get at the Nusa Dua : []
Didn't enjoy much of the facilities since most of my time for work at the conference center just in front of the hotel, but I managed to try the gym, sauna, play house and the swimming pool at the Spa house for free : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Overall this is a good hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
During our time in this room we had to kill 2 cockroaches and couldn't leave any drinks or snacks around as they attracted hundreds of ants : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The rooms are clean and spacious and the service is very freindly everywhere : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It was lovely to sit and relax and meet other people from all over the World : []
the resort has a very indonesian flavour to it and the staff are very warm and hospitable, catering to special requests quickly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough to help with any request : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I am pleased to say that this was exactly what we got! Due to flight delays, we arrived at 2am and were greeted with smiles and courtesy : []
We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel, and plan to go back as soon as we can : []
The other problem that stems from this is that while there is a pricey bill at the end, you will also lose money from tipping, which if you feel for the human condition of Balinese people its kind of essential to tip and they deserve it because they work hard : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The food and drinks are expensive : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Before we bought the coupons I had researched the hotel and found out it was one of the first in the area : [u'location', u'general']
They were certainly focusing on quantity and not quality : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Most enjoyable time spent with friends : [u'overall', u'culture']
The beach is amazing and wasn't too packed at all, good activities in the swimming pool too : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Beautiful location with excellent security for those who worry about that kind of thing when travelling : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The beaches are wonderful, golden sand and clear water : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Looking forward to recomend the hotel, to friends and families : [u'overall', u'culture']
spa is fab as are the staff there : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Even though the hotel already 27 years old, but we can see it is very well maintenance : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
booking essential via reception : [u'amenities', u'banquet', u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Staff were friendly and the place was clean : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We booked the Palace suite with the Club advantages which are a blast and well worth it : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I felt the room was looking a bit tired and could do with an upgrade or refurbishment : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Particular mention must go to the "effervescent" Anita, who would bend over backwards to help, even to the point of joining us for a game of soccer : [u'amenities', u'patio']
it just takes you to the level of comfort and relaxation : []
We were planning to complain to the staff, but since we were in a hurry due to very tight schedule with our return planes, we were practically running to catch the plane in the airport and totally forgot about it : []
Amazing as I only asked the night before! : []
The hotel sadly has aged and is now 4 star at most : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Staff were exceptional and met our slightest wish with a wonderful Bali smile : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This place is amazing great location : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
l have traveled all over the world and have never encountered such warm,friendly,loving,genuine people : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The resort lived up to our expectation in every way : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The beach barbeque dinner included overcooked prawns and mussels that were clearly off : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed at the Nusa Dua beach for one night on business : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Once that was resolved there was not one thing that could be faulted : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also why would they charge money for internett usage in the room when its the slowest connection I have ever experianced in a hotel? All in all, i would recommend it : []
You can enjoy other spa facilities for the whole day, like the spa lap pool : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food at all the restaurants was delicious at all times : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Our stay was slightly tainted by the illness of my father who passed away the day after our return so possibly another stay may be in order to fully appreciate the hotel : [u'location', u'sea']
Would come here again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I still love it though and will go back, staff are friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We wanted to book a day trip somewhere and asked one of the staff members where we could do it, we were pointed towards a desk but no one was ever there : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel has a cash point which is handy for getting the currency, There is a complimentary bus that runs to the Bali Collections or you could walk it in 15 minutes, but the last bus leaves at 10pm : [u'location', u'airport', u'station']
Overall my experience at the hotel & spa was classy and elegant! hope to re-visit with my hubby! :) : [u'overall', u'feel']
Beautiful location and grounds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is very nice and big and right on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Pool area is nice too but a slide for the kids should be added to increase the fun : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
this hotel rocks was my second visit to bali was in grand hyatt but this hotel was just amazing huge resort lets you unwind the beach is great and the food was great too : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The resort is very good and beautiful : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The experience was good : [u'overall', u'feel']
2 superb swiimming-pools (we loved drinking cocktails sitting at the bar in the middle of the largest pool), 4 tasteful restaurants, a lovely beach in front of the hotel, and the amazing Palace Club facilities : a very large room with XXXL bed and jacuzzi, incredible breakfast and evening cocktail with meals from all around the world : []
the customer service exudes from each and every employee : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Ayou will provide you with pain free therapeutic massages that leave you feeling like a million dollars - don't miss a day : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We will definitely make this our choice when travelling to Bali again : []
Definitely i would recommend this place to my family and friends and also visit it very shortly and whenever i need a good relaxing break !! : []
This was our 1st visit to Bali and the Nusa Dua Hotel & Spa is the reason whey we will be going back again : []
Within short (15mins) walking distance to Bali Collection and the shops and restaurants on the main road : [u'amenities', u'garden']
But for the rest, what a disappointment! : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
And if you want to get married there what a fantastic venue, and the food for the receptions yum!!Friendly staff, free transfers to the local shopping mall : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
I do hope we have the opportunity to return - I wouldn't even check out another hotel, but just book straight away for this one : []
Not like the hot treeless stone covered other high end resorts nearby : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The afternoon tea was also lovely as it was served as a full 3 platter, sandwich, scones and cakes with tea or juices etc : []
The breakfast area is busy at times but lovely, next to ponds with koi fish : [u'location', u'general']
The entrance and grounds are beautiful and well maintained : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel has a more open feel and the pools are definitely the most newly renovated : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our 8 night stay at this Resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
+ beautiful pool : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We would consider staying at this hotel again the next time we visit Bali : []
This is a hotel that you really don't ever want to leave : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was spacious and for the most part very clean except for a few small cobwebs on the bed head what looked like a small amount of mould in the shower cubicle : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Located in Nusa Dua, altho far from the shopping district, it does offer the guest a nice and peaceful environment : []
About hotel taxi, someone have recommended to use, but it is very expensive : []
We got a 2h 30min treatment including the honeymoon package (which is worth the price) and actually we had our own spacious spa villa, with jacuzzi, steam room and sauna where we could get relaxed and nobody was disturbing : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
My wife and I chose to stay here in Nusa Dua as our second trip to Bali, the first trip staying at the Padma in Legian (5/5!) : [u'overall', u'culture']
50 off : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Grounds and pools were excellent and well maintained : [u'overall', u'safety']
takes 10 minutes to walk from the reception to the beach : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We loved our stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : []
the hotel complex is very large with shops, restaurants and day spa : [u'location', u'general']
We booked the Bali Safari and Marine Park through the resort and it included everything including transport and lunch : []
Beach is ok, again nothing extraordinary - though that's not hotel's fault : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In summary - don't hesitate to go to Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We would stay here again coming with kids but would try one of the other hotels next door that are 5 star if coming with no kids : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
on checking in we were upgraded to palace club room : []
The breakfast service was slow and at times seemed understaffed for the number of guests : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Soft drinks and tea and coffee were available 24 hours a day : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The service at the Balinese restaurant its wonderful! Thank you Miss ADE :-) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Asian bistro was our fav place to eat though : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant']
This is our forth trip to the Nusa Dua Hotel and once again they have exceeded expectations : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
price is high for any services in the hotel such as taxi service, doctor service , water bottles, Overall enjoyed the stay !!! : []
Gorgeous in fact : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is also 5 star resorts located all along the beach front at Nusa Dua, so you could eat at any of these, however why would you bother when the prices are just as much as Nusa Dua Resort and the food here is very nice : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We do not travel with kids and enjoyed the fact that we could enjoy somewhere quiet and very relaxing : []
In the room there was a large walk in shower, bath and seperate WC and a walk in wardrobe : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
we would recomend at least 3 resturaunts : []
But overall, we're very statisfied with our stay here : []
Missed that one : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I agree that the price of the food is high, and indeed you can get cheaper food outside the hotel, which we did do at times : []
Breakfasts were unbelievable with a multitude of delights : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Myself and my husband stayed in this hotel for my brothers wedding : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
The hotel room and facilities are well kept, everything looking new, great toiletry, changed everyday (even a good quality wooden hairbrush, that my wife took to the beach was replaced) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Well, what an absolutely amazing experience, right from the Quality of the accommodation and facilities, the immaculately kept gardens to the most warm and friendly staff we have come across in our years of travel : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Free Internet access was part of the service and we were offered an upgrade to an ocean view suite : []
We had a huge list of places to go in Bali : []
Having stayed here previously at the Palace Club, we found the service of the older staff was to be as expected, but the younger staff were slightly lackadaisical in their attention : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Prices were standard , 5 -star hotel rates, however, the food was immensely appetizing : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We stayed at this hotel many years ago and some parts are in need of a facelift : [u'location', u'general']
We met a driver walking to Bali Collections and he was great : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We travelled with 4 families and check-in was friendly and quick, with a free cocktail : [u'overall', u'culture']
Friendly and helpful staffs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All in all a lovely holiday just disappointed with issues regarding the noise factor and the inconvenience it created : []
Everyone from manager down are so friendly and helpful, nothing is to much after spending a hectic time traveling in Europe it was so nice to relax by the pool and be waited on, also the breakfast were great and the staff superb : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
I feel the landscaping has a lot to be desired and areas around pool just don't feel as presented as other places I have stayed : [u'location', u'general']
Upon checkout our room payment was on the bill when we had already made this payment along with an item from the mini bar which we had not consumed : []
This can be quite pricey (pretty much the same as AUS prices) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Fish is cooked dry or coated in charcoal, lamb overcooked,chicken kebabs either raw or charcoal, : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The best point of this hotel was the food (I didn't expect such quality and variety) and the service : []
It is located brilliantly on nusa dua beach, with a great private stretch of beach just in front of it that it shares with the westin resort : []
Me &my boyfriend stayed in a deluxe room and our friends stayed in a superior room for 4 : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
There are shops passing themselves off as 'designer', they are not genuine : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We experienced excellent services of NDBH starting right from the airport pickup : []
All the staff were wonderful and the availability of the private lounge with its facilites made our holiday very memorable : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We felt for a 5 star hotel and the $10 million dollar or so upgrade, that surely Wi-Fi, should be FREE throughout the Resort : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There are so many resorts in nusa dua but this stands out because it looks more Balinese and its not full off kids : []
Only tip would be if you want a bed at the pool you have to get in early, seems like most people grabbed towels and reserved beds before going to breakfast, so get in early : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There was a buffet dinner provided and the food was wonderful the best ever! and there was so much to try and lots to go around : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
myself and my two daughters 11yrs and 14yrs thought we were in PARADISE : []
It would be really fantastic if the menu is varied every other day : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Only stayed one night but would definitely recommend this hotel to friends : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I have never seen a chef more dedicated to his work : []
you need to get up around the start of breakfast or when the pool management team come out, to "reserve" a spot at the main pool, or else fear the wrath of little kids in the other pools : [u'location', u'sea']
The hotel was decorated beautifully for the festive season, the hotel went out of its way, serving Christmas cookies and chocolates in the room, champagne with breakfast on New Years Day and presenting us with a beautiful hotel calender when we left : []
Another small point was the pancakes : [u'location', u'sea']
The room and buildings were kept clean and tidy, everything worked as it should, although some areas were showing their age : [u'location', u'general']
Comfortable room, great pools, picturesque gardens and peaceful atmosphere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed in the Palace club and they made us feel very special : []
We have already recommended it to work colleagues and family alike : []
There are not many hotels that I would say I am looking forward to returning to, but the Nusa Dua Beach is definitely one of these : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
First time back after or honeymoon 30 years ago but this time with 2 older children and 2 friends : [u'overall', u'culture']
Would love to go back sometime in the future : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The separate toilet has louvers in the door for ventilation but because there are openable shutters (so you can view the room from the bath) in the bathroom wall, all sounds from the toilet can be heard loud and clear in the room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The beach is beautiful, clean and hawker free : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
As soon as we get inside of the room, we could listen to all the conversations in the other room, and they were just talking normally : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
My only complaint is that I wish I had of stayed longer : []
The gardens were breathtaking and so perfectly manicured, i commend the hard working staff that would get up early every morning to rake up every leaf and flower that had fallen during the night : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
HBO on TV too! : []
A peaceful retreat in busy Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
great resort for families and couples : [u'overall', u'culture']
I believe "Palace Club" do get extra flourishes, but why not everyone? It surely would cost little, but in general think they would rather make the extra money from their guests : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The only issue we had was that there were some inconsistencies with the knowledge about the package and its benefits between different staff/ venues around the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Rooms are clean and the bed was comfortable, I had booked a deluxe room but had a standard room allocated, we requested a bathroom with a bathtub and approached staff at reception twice to no avail, the bathroom was small and the water pressure was poor but the room was good in all other aspects : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
until your humble and helpful staff Ms Ketut who's in charge on 23rd Dec 2014 at your reception desk informed us that you guys have a special "suite" promo : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
is going towards families with small children : [u'overall', u'culture']
Breakfast is ok but once again not to a 5 star standard : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The many pools were excellent - loved the swim-up bar! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Did white water rafting [actually not me but husband and kids as I was otherwise occupied at the spa that day,sad I know] and also the cycling tour which i did participate in : []
The standards rooms aren't that great, we quickly upgraded to the palace suite, which was nicer but still didn't have that "wow" factor : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Congratulations and keep it up : []
Many thanks to Sadnyana and all the team who greeted us each day with smiles and a genuine willingness to do whatever they could to make each day perfect : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
It was worth every cent : []
What an excellent end to our holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We were not disappointed!! : []
We ate lunch at two (Chess Bar and Sandro's Pizzeria) and of course ate the fantastic breakfast 'buffet' at the Wedang Jahe restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The tiles above water level need a good clean and I hope now it is the off season, this will be done : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you want to go to any restaurant just ask to reception and they will announce the restaurant and get free transport back and forth : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The rooms close to the pool and Gecko is very convenient : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The resort is fantastic, thanks to the excellent work by the General Manager and helpful staff, we will definitely go back again : []
The spa is lovely, though no bargain : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Despite what some other reviews say, our room was in great condition with all fittings and fixtures functioning well, the a/c was also quiet and easy to operate : []
The gardens are stunning and the location is perfect, right on the beach which is safe for swimmming : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Back to the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Also its open area and hence no aircon : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The photos on the site are what you see : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In summary though, we would find it hard to try a different hotel in Bali after the success of this stay : []
Of all the hotels that lie on the same laguna strip adjacent to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, - Westin, Melia Bali, Laguna - this is the one retaining pure traditions of Bali, best beach (the biggest of all the hotels and the only one with most sun, unlike the closest hotels) and huge territory : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Let me first say that although I did much research on Bali in October and it's location near the equator, I was not at all prepared for the oppressing heat : []
This hotel has been around for quite some time but you can tell that it's been pretty well maintained : []
Dining - Breakfast buffet had a decent variety and the freshly cooked eggs/omlettes were tasty : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The family room was spacious and always cleaned to an excellent standard : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
00 am from a charming lady put me in the right frame of mind on my daily walk as I watched the sun rising : [u'location', u'sea']
The exceptional hospitality and care touch our hearts : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall we were very happy with this hotel, it was pretty, very clean and the staff couldn't do more for us : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The hotel is right on the beach which is beautiful and I particularly enjoyed our first night's dinner at the Chess restaurant by the sea : []
Amazing resort, with amazing pool, well maintained beach and facilities, staff very friendly and helpful : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Even though the hotel was kind of old, but was still well maintenance : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Pros: Pool, location on the beach is great, grounds, friendly staff, definately worth the $$$, you have to experience it to understand : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The next staff took quite a while to come out of the room behind to help with the booking, by then I have waited for more than 5 minutes : []
Thorough professionalism and attention to detail : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
There were marks/stains in the room, the service of the staff is average at best, the food in the restaurants was, again, very average : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Twice the original quote : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
It's big and impersonal and sadly lacking in balanese charm which was a real plus with the other two hotels : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Had 2 beautiful meals at the Raja's Balinese Restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The premier room is usually equipped with a king bed and a separate living space which opens out onto a private balcony/terrace : [u'amenities', u'conference']
All the rooms are good : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
No way is this a five star hotel and if I wasn't here on business I would be checking out : []
The pools are spetacular with a in-the-pool bar, many restaurants for when you cant be bothered to go out, service is great and the beach is pristine : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Kecak dance dinner was great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
We stayed in one of the palace club rooms that offers all the additional extras such as afternoon tea, cocktail hour and wifi in our room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, I opted to upgrade to a Palace suite as for peace of mind I prefer a room on a higher floor when travelling solo : []
There was a glitch which I was had a chat time with my wife in the balcony around 11 : []
Well serviced rooms, good size deluxe room for three persons : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Choices of biking route experiences to nearest attractions e : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
In fact, you can walk for quite some distance along a partially shaded coastal path, passing other hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was almost completed when we stayed there last year, so perhaps should be completed by now : []
The resort would provide a wonderful tourist destination for individuals, families and friends : [u'amenities', u'pool']
It is obvious the Hotel and staff have been working hard behind the scenes to lift the bar even higher : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The rooms are exquisite as are the pools : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
One night the ceiling was leaking water, reported it to reception & a guy arrived with 3 bottles of water for us : []
Impressive entrance area especially at night : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
I was off a mind to just delete the email and not respond at all I would suggest you get rid of the compulsory review otherwise you may miss out on some reviews and maybe generate negative reviews through making this section compulsory : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
After I had paid for the entire bill, we were offered 50% off our next stay there!! How thoughtful! It was blatantly obvious that we would not be setting foot on the site ever again, so this was merely lip service : []
No more traffic jams and an enjoyable 15 minute taxi fare from the refurbished airport saw us to the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It became a drag after a while as other guests would leave towels and then re-appear at midday, or never : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Second time round the hotel didn't seem as 'heavenly' but that could have been because it wasn't a novelty any more : []
Afternoon tea consists of sandwiches, cream scones,cakes and pastries : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
However, that night I found dead body of an insect and hundreds of ants surrounding it : []
hi stayed at this hotel for seven days i was so impressed with the hotel facilities and staff everything done with a smile : []
Only complaint was there was not internet in our room but would absolutely stay here again : [u'amenities', u'internet']
See you next year Palace Club, sorry to haven taken so long to have come back to our second home : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We loved the Balinese feel to the place, versus the more modern concrete look & feel you get at some more modern styled hotels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We booked standard rooms : []
- Last but not least is Staff friendliness is GREAT : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was so amazing because the flowers smell so good : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Price was standard for any hotel in the area, which is a little less than western pricing but expensive for Bali : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Take lot of extra cash for handicraft shopping!!Can walk around to other hotels along walkway & check out restaurants : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
What I really didn't like is that they charged my credit card $200 when I checked in as a "hold" : []
Very kind staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The management is also extremely conscious of its PR manner and likewise are hugely accommodating and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Everything is beautifully maintained, including the pools and gardens : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would like to stay there again in the future : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The breakfasts offered so much choice with fresh juices, eggs and pancakes cooked to order and a huge buffet spread of fruits, pastries, cereals and other savouries that we never needed more than a smoothie or juice for lunch : []
But if you just want to relax at the pool or the beach it is a great stay : []
I booked the Hotel with the help of Ms : []
There is a shuttle bus to a shopping centre, however its only a short walk and the way the bus picks up and drops off at every hotel, by walking you can nearly beat it to the shopping centre on some occasions : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On a couple of nights, we just take a 3 minutes walk along the beach to the nearby hotels for bale and sip a drink there : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
When we arrived I really thought that they had taken us to the wrong resort : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The de luxe room is a bit expensive us$ 168 : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Breakfast was busy but service and food selection were excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
Excellent dining entertainment : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Spa - this is situated at the front of the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The old boys on reception were a bit grim but all other staff members we dealt with were outstanding : [u'amenities', u'banquet', u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
The compliment water was not enough for three of us and the price of mini bar water was extremely high for Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The only negative to this hotel is the beach : [u'location', u'sea']
with great services : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They have a wonderful lap pool and top class gym : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Their private beach is best for spending quality time with your loved one : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Definitely will come back again! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Don't think I could have ordered a better cake in Australia!!! : []
My only other gripe with the hotel itself is that they seriously need to consider replacing the old brown towels at the spa pool, and perhaps new ones by the main pools also, as they are starting to look quite tatty : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We came through AsiaLuxe Holidays and had a wonderful time : []
Breakfast was excellent, again, impressively managed for so many people, we thought breakfast at the Amari Palm Reef in Koh Samui was the best we had seen in South Asia, until now, this is fantastic, the fresh produce is immaculate : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
There's lots of bugs coz lots of tropical trees surrounding the lower floors : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
5/5 if it was available, it is most likely a good fit for family, honeymooners and more novice Asian travelers, just not for us : []
One disappointment was the sea : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The hotel was warm and welcoming : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The food at the resort was below average and overpriced : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Ensure that you stroll along the beach, get a massage and if you want indulge a million activities they arrange : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However, the restaurant was not as I expected : []
Great markets in Nusa Dua and a huge modern shopping centre all within walking distance : [u'overall', u'culture']
It would have been good to have a few things at the buffet for the children : []
This is a perfect place to rest : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are four restaurants to choose from, all very nice,breakfast is buffet, and one of the best I have ever seen : []
Had dinner one night at their Chess restaurant which is right on the beach, l had Mie Goreng, it was excellent : []
Despite the lush gardens and grassed areas this hotel seemed to have fewer mosquitos than we had previously experienced so they must do a good job in controlling the little blighters! The public area Wi-Fi was perfectly adequate and in our room was available on the balcony/terrace with enough speed for surfing but probably not enough for streaming videos etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Chess Bar and restaurant was our favourite, idyllic location : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The pools are fantastic, the variety of restaurants (5) is great, the staff are happy and attentive, the rooms are spotless, the all-inclusive buffet breakfast is superb, and there are no flies, mosquitoes, bugs, ants or other nasties to spoil the days : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
This is a sign of good management : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They provide us wheelchair for our grandmother that hardly to walk : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We also visited the local village with it's shops and markets, even the local people were friendly : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
It such ashame, when you see guests all huddled in the reception area, checking their free Wi-Fi emails/facebook/etc : []
If you feel like a change there is a courtesy bus for the 5 min trip to the local shops and restaurants : [u'location', u'airport', u'station']
Had gone there for a 5 day holiday and Bali seemed more beautiful thanks to this amazing hotel : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Arriving in Benoa with Oceania Cruises, my travelagency booked a one night room in the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There is an excellent spa and exercise centre - air conditioned of course and again the staff are very helpful and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Stayed here April this year and the service and food were very good : [u'location', u'sea']
Main pool areas as described, no obvious problems with sun lounger availability but we tended to go later in the afternoon : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Only downfall is the kids club, not overly welcoming and tucked away inside : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Everything was great, the rooms were lovely and the room cleaners both male and female did a wonderful job, we came back from breakfast to a sparkling room : []
The hotel has loads of facilities like beach volley, table tennis, lawn tennis, water sports counter, squash, gym,water aerobics, yoga and much more : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
My Daughter and I loved our stay although we were un happy that twin beds were NOT provided as we had arranged : []
This meant that at night we were able to have the glass ones open and wooden ones letting in the breeze which meant we escaped having to use air con at night, just lovely : []
The room was recently refurbished and very clean, comfortable and stylish, looking out over the gardens : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We could have done without the hassle, however it was rectified pretty quickly : []
The gym was also great : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Love the artisanal bread : [u'overall', u'culture']
Even the vacant rooms there were aired daily and fresh touches of frangipanis etc were placed around the rooms : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Italian restaurant spinach cannelloni was rubbery and topped with heavy thick cheese, Very poor : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Its also a bit out of the way - 2-way taxi to Ubud costs 300,000 rupiah : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The food was was good : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
They all looked great, and had good basic English : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We will be back for more : []
If you're in Nusa Dua for a convention and wants the convenience of being close to the BNDCC, this is the place to stay as it is just right across the convention center : []
Can't wait to come back again!!! : []
We first noticed in the taxi from the airport, where we had to drive through a security checkpoint at the entrance of the Nusa Dua resort area(a result of the Bali bombings : []
The spa left much to be desired and is in fact best avoided, unless you want to hear what is happening in the room next door : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also this hotel is very close to Bali collection which has a shuttle bus to take you there for free every half hour to an hour which contains numerous restaurants and markets : [u'amenities', u'conference']
These guys really take cleanliness as their number one issue : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We wanted to stay away from crowd in Bali so we found this beautiful hotel in the beautiful area providing manicured grass around the area plus the hotel provide what every family and couple need during their holiday : [u'overall', u'culture']
Set amongst beautiful gardens with traditional Balinese decor (unlike others), we found it to be very relaxing : []

If you need to relax this is the place! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If so, consider staying at other parts of the island to experience the genuine Balinese hospitality (for example, Seminyak, or on the North/East coast) : [u'location', u'sea']
We came here on a singapore/bali combo : []
Believe me, whoever wishes or have already planned to stay in this hotel, would be for nice surprise : []

We tried the Westin nextdoor, and ate there and had a walk around, but to be honest I wasn't impressed with that hotel at all : []
We are from the United States and never thought we would travel to Indonesia for a holiday as the trip from the US is such a very long flight : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Two 3 story wings reach out to the beach front and between there are lovely garden sections with beautiful flowers and high palm trees between discreetly placed restaurants and swimming pools : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Palace Club Room, beautiful and more spacious premier rooms : [u'overall', u'spacious']
Only used the kids club once which the kids seemed to enjoy but they preferred to be in the pool! Drinks and food in the hotel are extremely over priced as are the spa services - Bali collection which is only a 2 min taxi ride ($1) or 10 min walk away is the place to eat and cheap massages and beauty treatments available in spas at the main gates of Nusa dua also walking distance ($8-$10) for one hour massage : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

^^ the beaches was clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We promise to be back soon : []
If I arrived at the restaurant after a certain time, waiting period was more than 30 minutes : [u'location', u'sea']
Rooms very tired - I couldn't give the resort overall any more than 4* : []
Restaurant staff in particular are generally clue less as to basic etiquette : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
00 per head expensive for Bali but we ate 3 courses and enjoyed the whole experience : []
We were surprised to be presented with champagne & a beautiful flower arrangement and a card with best wishes from the Hotel, such a nice touch which we really appreciated and made us feel very special : []
My only two negatives would be; : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Our room is clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

I will definatelly consider returning here! : []
the room was not very nice however better than where we came from : []

It is a nice hotel (and probably nicer than most in Nusa Dua), but I don't believe very good value : []
some great views but way over priced : [u'location', u'sea']
Local shops barter barter barter i got a table cover for 80 000 which was great considering they started at 250 000 : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

The management were also very friendly and often came around and had a chat : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Tennis courts, squash courts, beach volley ball, table tennis, pushbikes, gym, lap pool etc : [u'amenities', u'gym']

We stayed at Nusadua Beach hotel & Spa from 28/12-11/01'13 : []
The breakfast is amazing, we had no trouble getting a lounge by the pool (although I expect this would be very hard during holiday periods), and everything was very clean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They were great for the kids! The beach was fairly nice,but the sand was large and hard on the feet : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Many of my colleagues stayed at the Westin hotel next door : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

lovey balcony to seat on to take in the views of the sea and beach and of course the gardens : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Ie- at the other hotels we stayed at as part of our honeymoon, we would receive a gift or room upgrade but here we had our towels made into a swan on our bed which we have had before when on a 'normal' holiday : []
Bali was the first place I had travelled abroad to and I was worried about it being dirty and a shock to the system in comparison to Australia - which it was - except for Nusa Dua, one of the prettiest places on the planet : []
Took a trip out with Bali Sea White water rafting, Ubud, Spa and seafood dinner and much more : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling']
The gardens are beatiful and trees with the small squirrels were always fun : [u'amenities', u'garden']

Hotel and grounds are spotless, room was huge and clean, people are friendly, especially Mushadi, the swim-up-bar cocktail pro : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

The food at the Chess restaurant is delicious : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
THE NEGATIVES: The biggest concern I had during my stay was that barely anyone could understand English : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But if you're looking for a quiet holiday away from the crowds, then this hotel is great with its private beach facility : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A conference at the nearby conference centre brought me to this hotel : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We had an amazing time, there was a great variety of local fruits at breakfast, the restaurants also offered good meals for dinner and lunch (although they can be a little expensive in comparison to other restaurants in Kuta or Ubud I think they were reasonable for a 5 star hotel) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
You are in Bali off course : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I wish I had a garden like that! In the middle of the pond, there is a balinese gazebo complete with a sofa set where one can sit to enjoy watching the ducks "gliding"by or feed the fish in the pond : []

If you are looking for Cancun's white soft sand beach, this is not the place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
While the food at the resort is excellent - especially the dinner buffets and shows, we tend to want to go out in the evenings - and the free shuttle makes that easy : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
The staff were just lovely, polite, well spoken & would do ANYTHING in their power to please : []
The room was much bigger than our expectations and was clean and well-maintained : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

If you get breakfast included it is vast and delicious the variety from asian, european and english fry ups is great : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We can recommend this resort to any couple or family who are after a great value holiday in Bali just outside of lively Kuta; whilst you will find cheaper places it would be hard to beat the service and facilities on the beach : []
For some fun try the bistro : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant']
The staff were generally very attentive and gave good service, and the free Wi-Fi in the public areas had a pretty good signal : [u'amenities', u'internet']

Suksma all for such a wonderful stay and please keep doing what you're doing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I only used the pool twice (we had a lot of rain on our trip) and experienced no problems : []
Must WATCH in the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The room was on the 4th floor and was so far away from reception that it was a real bind having to take so long to get there : []
went to Bali Collection for dinners, but prices were'nt astronomically high : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The atmosphere and ambience is simply romantic : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
The lack of wireless connection in the rooms was disappointing however readily available in the lobby area and poolside : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
They also have espresso machines, so I could enjoy a decent coffee with my breakfast : []
They look lovely at night, when all lit up : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

The staff were so attentive and welcoming and were definitely one of the main reasons this hotel is so special : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It feels incredibly secure as all cars must go through a security gate where they are opened and checked by several guards as they enter the resort and again a similar security check at the entrance to the Nusa Dua hotel : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
we all didnt want to leave xxx : []
The staff is ever so friendly and you really feel at home here, where you are sincerely taken care of : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great memories for our family! : [u'overall', u'culture']
Staff also seemed to cater to the Russian's every whim (probably because they screamed at the poor Balinese) sometimes forgetting that there were other guests at the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Granted it is an older hotel, but that is why we loved it : []
It is not located near anything in particular but an outdoor shopping mall, which only tourists appear to frequent : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']

I complained about aircon one night and was automatically offered a room change or upgrade : []
During our stay, we ate at all the restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed every one, and I can recommend the Palm Mojito's at the Chess Bar! We also had massages and treatments at the Spa which were very relaxing - the Coconut body Scrub was excellent : []
My husband and I stayed here for 9 nights on our honeymoon : [u'overall', u'culture']
The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly! : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
we were then asked for a cash donation before we could leave the island ! So in summary the hotel is beautiful, the food is tasty and well presented if somewhat expensive and you have every facility available to cater for your needs,just be aware of the beach hawkers ! : []
We rent two bicycles and get around and found out the beach right at the Westin and Hyatt is much better compare to Nusa dua : []
Nevertheless, note that you are in a closed artificial tourist are which has not a lot to do with the real Bali : [u'amenities', u'conference']
you can do better than that! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Lots of shady spots with cushioned beach lounges were available, great large clean beach towels : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Asleep when I hit the pillow after relaxing all day! : []
We enjoyed a dip in the spa's private pool (which stays open till 10:00pm!), the atmosphere was calm and serene : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We booked through Trailfinders and were more than satisfied : []
The restaurants were excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
DVD player has different system than last time, our DVD's from Europe didnt work, wrong zone, that wasnt nice, but now when we need to spend more time at room in evenings (wine problem) it was good that there is few movie channels (free), it was nice : []
Tip go to minimart for your alchohol : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Palace club suite the way to go with 2 large rooms, a separate bathroom for the lounge, dual opening on to garden balcony : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
The breakfast was good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Very silent area : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
the best place to relax and unwind : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
000 IDR (ca 9 USD) for that bottle! Can you imagine? A bottle like that cost normally around 4 : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Restaurant and food quality was a trifle disappointing but we had no problems, eating well for the week : []
the pool was the cleanest pool I have ever seen : []
but only in Nusa Dua Beach hotel i can feel the true comfort : []
In the bathroom the standard of finish was pretty poor and there were minor problems with the sink (it leaked a bit and it was difficult to get the plug to remain down) : []
But the room is clean; full toiletries and good bath & facilities : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

The gardens are beautiful & create a delightful atmosphere : []
Bumbu Bali is amazing : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
it's a nice and clean room, but I found the A/C not as cold as I want it to be, so I reported it and the technician came : []
There is a shuttle bus to a shopping centre which is like a mall, but if you wanted a more Balinese shopping experience you can walk out the front of the resort and pick up a cheap taxi ride : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Cultural dinners were fantastic - Spa treatments out of this world : [u'overall', u'culture']
The Chess restaurant was disappointing, we ordered the seafood platter for 2 and the fish arrived overcooked, lobster burnt and rather tasteless for the price charged : [u'food-beverages', u'meal', u'amenities', u'pool']
The staff add to the warmth of Bali and made it so much harder to leave or come home : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub']

The location of the hotel is far off from all the major happenings of Bali : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The food and drinks were really expensive and it was hard to get out of the hotel : []
(The Tropical was the best for meals) We went to The Tropical a few times as we found it to be the best one : [u'location', u'sea']
The atmosphere is peaceful and tranquil, because of the Balinese touch in building and ornament, perhaps : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
the location is good for most areas to see the only thing i would say is that the food and drinks are a bit over priced but hey you are in a 5 star hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room, staff, pool & gardens are great : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']

Just as it says on the hotel website, we went for our nieces wedding and what a setting it was lovely tropical oasis surrounded by beautiful flowers and greenery, There are two lagoon pools one with the idea of a beach setting, the temperatures were heavenly just like getting into a warm bath : [u'location', u'sea']

Having found this hotel during an online search and going on reviews from this very travel site, I gained a positive impression and went ahead and booked my wedding and stay at this hotel : []
The Palace Club is well worth the upgrade and the satff are : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
If you stay in a Palace club room you get access to the Palace Cub which is a wing of the hotel with a library filled with books on Bali and architecture and gardens and some fiction books, lovely furniture settings, a big garden with ponds and special food events which pretty much go all day from the breakfast, then mid afternoon high tea with lovely cakes and drinks then cocktails with canapes early evening : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The air conditions did not work, the room was warm : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I liked the way they changed items every day : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Location was great, Relaxing away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta but a short walking distance to water sports and shopping : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Only down side was the bacon which is more than crisp, but to handle bacon under a klosh, for that many guests is a hard call : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A special thanks to Supadmi, she is a very friendly and efficient lady : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Verdict: unlike M who gives professional service and free room upgrade all the time, this hotel makes it up with the new bed : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We had the most amazing time during our two week stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, we got married while we were there : []
30 though and the room was ready : []
Big sprawling hotel that lacks charm : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast in an exclusive section of the hotel - no menus or heated food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If you want to sit on a deck chair your whole holiday, then this is the place for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bottled water is provided free of charge in your room : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We were upgraded to a nice one bedroom suite on the ground level and provided access to the club facilities which meant nice breakfasts, high tea snack, and happy hour drinks gratis : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
After reading some reviews some people are obviously hard to please or will whinge about the smallest thing : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
However, be firm when scheduling your appointment : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
So that was night 1 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed a week this year , but next year plan to stay 2-3 : []
I also would have expected better food at a resort of this calibre (at the restaurants) - it was nice but very average : []
But not fried mushrooms : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
i like to thank Yasa : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
No full length mirror which was very frustrating to see when I was dressing for a wedding : []

An unbelievable venue, depicting the true Balinese culture in all it glory from hand carved wood to hand chiseled statues : [u'room', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics']
No Wifi in the rooms but free in the lobby, service slow though : [u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Upon distant inspection of close neighbouring hotels, The NDBC appeared to represent very good value : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

Our very patient consultant helped to finish everything with joy : [u'overall', u'culture']
The resort was absolutely lovely : [u'amenities', u'pool']
This trip we decided to and were very thankful : []

The room is clean and the breakfast selection is great : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
Big hotel , but it did not fall on : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Could management look into providing courtesy buses to and from the other centres like Kuta, Legian, Seminyak etc to enable guests to do some shopping and return after 2-3-4 hours ? : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff at this resort were fantastic throughout and the swim up bar was also well used : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Staff was great and attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The hotel resort is eventough a bit older and dated well maintained : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The only negative was that the weekend we arrived the hotel was almost booked out with a big Japanese convention so we weren't upgraded for the first two nights and the first room smelled of smoke : []
in room dining was ok, i did get sick from 1 meal ordered in house which always puts you out of action for a day but my wife had no problems : [u'overall', u'culture']
The guy at the desk gave me a thumbs up and told me we had been given the best room, and I agree we could not of had a better room : []
The grounds are still being maintained to a high standard : [u'overall', u'safety']
Five stars for such an hotel is, to our mind, clearly overrated : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Having stayed in Nusa Dua on a previous occassion, I already knew a little of what to expect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Right on the beach and perfect rooms, spotlessly clean, large in size and many different facilities at the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The hotel staff, like most Balinese people, were very polite and generous with their smiles : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We think that if you want to get away from the Sanitised American Chain Hotels, this is the best alternative available, that punches it's own weight with the best BALI has to offer : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
they use bhi tours & travel in bali for transfers,tours,etc : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The only real negative is the price of food & drinks : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The only problem we had is that we were originally located a room in the hotel which appeared to have not been occupied for while - as a result of this the linen was dirty and the room lacked the luxury feel you got from the rest of the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
all in all i was very happy and relaxed at the nusa dua beach hotel, and found that the grounds and facilities were comparable to other more expensive nusa dua hotels (hyatt, laguna, westin) : [u'overall', u'safety']
A few more chairs under the trees would help as well as not everyone needs to be right next to the pools : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

Fabulous location for a family holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
lot of other things on mind of Hotel and Bali, but next time : [u'location', u'sea']
The issue is the pricing of the food and drink together with the location : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The waffles were horrible, and pancakes not much better : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The massages were also very expensive relative to the quality : [u'amenities', u'gym']
I had a company business trip in Bali last June and was thrilled by this hotel : []
Very common to have staff talk loudly, among themselves, over your head while eating : [u'amenities', u'conference']

Evening entertainement very poor : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
What amazing people this resort has working for them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

It was idyllic and well worth the extra AU$70 per night : []

It is important to note that when staying at any luxury hotel the experience may not be as 'local' as hoped, but we found the hotel well situated for exploring the rest of the island and they can also help to arrange tours : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'others']

In a club lounge and area : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
The main problem with this hotel is the beach, although it looks lovely its no good for swimming : []
However beware of telling the local taxi drivers your plans, as we were wrongly picked up and took on the wrong elephant trip, by a local taxi driver by unwittingly telling one of our plans the next day : []
Thoroughly recommend the hotel for family holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Top resort : [u'amenities', u'patio']

There are the positive and less positive elements that are for me important to talk about : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is quite old and in some areas it shows but not a major issue : []
The rooms are beautifully deck out with extensive wood features : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
There was also a pool which was outside the Day Spa and next to the tennis courts which was at the front of the hotel, this pool was right next to our room and was fantastic, it was always very quiet being next to the beauty spa and was very clean : []
The hotel and grounds are beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel resort was very big with a variety of restuarants and bars, and if you didn't want to go to any of them there was regular entertainment in the evening : [u'overall', u'culture']
Our son made use of the Gecko Kids club a couple of times through our stay, and he usually didn't like to be dragged away as he was having so much fun : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hotel does good job of cleaning up but still : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Try to get up to Ubud to see the shops & rice fields : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
I LOVED this hotel! The grounds are perfect, the food is fantastic, the beach is amazing : []
- coctails and fresh juices (and in-house dining generally as well) were very nice but somewhat pricey (around 12$ for a pina colada) : []
He is affiliated to the hotel so he can be gooked through the nusa dua hotel : []
the cost for a local beer was 64000 rupiah and a simple hamburger 160 : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Remember to pay your driver well !!! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Honestly, I never think Nusa Dua Beach would be my fave as I try it on 6th after Sheraton, Nikko, Novotel, Ayodya and Melia : []
Part of the reason we chose this resort is that it is close to the beach and easy access to the Bali Collection area as well, which has a good range of restaurants and shopping in Nusa Dua : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Cornflakes are good if you use the drawer and take out a large spoon, otherwise the wooden spoon provided provides one flake at a time : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, at $25 for a decent meal (pool side toasted cheese sandwich and fries!!!) , I think I could have saved the cost of flights and stayed in Australia : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Security is not a concern anywhere across the property : [u'overall', u'safety']
Beautiful hotel with gorgeous gardens and pools : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Consider staying a few days at Kajane Mua Villas in UBUD which excellent : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']

Our bedroom had seen better days and is in need of a revamp : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
But the breakfast was amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
For #3 I'll bring my own travel wifi device : []
We had a superior room facing the garden, which was a good size and decorated in a traditional balinese style : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Would love to go again!! : []
Unfortunately, I booked a room that was not as nice as the first time around : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
An information card on the air conditioning controls would be a bonus as they are a bit hard to work out : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The pool bar was great and busy but not where you can't get a bed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The monuments and decorations are incredible : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The staff is very nice and considerable and the food in the balinese restaurant is very good! also the chess bar has great salads and lemonades : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
From the moment we arrived we were treated very graciously by all the staff : []
We will be back : [u'amenities', u'patio']

We had everything we could possibly have wanted and so much more : []
The dessert was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We have holidayed in Bali 3 times before staying in Villas, we found the resort location fantastic, great beach with everything at hand : []
My Husband and I had never been to the NusaDuaBeachResort and Spa and were very impressed by the attention to details and warmth of the staff throughout the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The restaurants on site are so-so, not quite up to the level that could be expected, especially the one closest to the beach serving rather bland (and expensive) poorly prepared curries and other things : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We also explored the Hyatt which seemed even more manufactured : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It is grand, stunning, luxurious and very well appointed : []
Overall, bali is a good place to have a relaxing vocation, except the high living standard : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
we called reception & after repeating myself 3 times, she finally understood & said she'd sent more cushions up, 45 mins later, I called again to tell them no one had come and spoke to a guy who couldn't understand English then another girl who I had to repeat what I was saying 3 times, finally she understood and sent someone up to change them : [u'overall', u'culture']

This was the most amazing holiday we have ever experienced : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is impossible not to get water everywhere! Everyday we soaked the floor : []
We actually like this place, but I am conflicted taking into consideration the bad side : []
Four Restaurants give you plenty of dinning choices and the buffet breakfasts are the best ! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The buffet breakfast was the best that I have had with a great variety of cuisines : []
I did have a look at their standard rooms (which are okay) but I stayed at a Palace Club room on the ground floor which opened to a frangipani-scented garden : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I can honestly say that everyone was so polite and went out of their way to do everything they could to make our stay special : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Are you planning to eat at the hotel you better bring a lot of money : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
restaurants were great the best pizzas for lunch : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']

Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa was just esceptional : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We loved this place and Bali in general : []
The restaurants are good but overpriced, especially the wines : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
We totally recomend this hotel : []
it would be wiser choice to rent a car to get around : []
Another feature I would of liked, is a channel dedicated to show your racked up expenses during your stay, this always helps you watch your budget, and I find it extremely useful in other hotels : []
We were greated with the flare of a 5 star hotel : []
Breakfast is very good : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Even the police guards were always trying to make contact in a kind way : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
There was an awful smell coming from either the drains in the bathroom or the toilet : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
The food was expensive to eat within the hotel which pushed us to go outside the walls : [u'amenities', u'conference']
If I had to find a negative, apart from the eggsat breakfast the hash browns and other sides come out cold : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The cost of everything, except alcohol, is cheap by any standards, and for variety of food you can travel to the nearby "Bali Collection" (1 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
) Breakfast each day was included : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
It was too short & steep & once sea is down it leaves vast area of mud & waste land : []

The beaches are amazing full of sports activities, swimming pools, bars, restaurants, music all day long and shows during the night : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']

premier room is average in size but neat any smaller room would have been cramped : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The food is great, not cheap, but good value : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
A good place to keep all the shopping : [u'amenities', u'shopping', u'location', u'mall']
It is walking distance from shops and restaurants : []

However, if you want a good choice of dining take the shuttle (free) which runs hourly from the main desk to Bali Collection which is a shopping mall within Nusa Dua suburb : [u'amenities', u'conference']
If you happen to go a bit late to the pool or beach area, you have the chance of not finding a chair : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Every enquiry or request was dealt with a smile and effortlessly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

we paid for a 5 star hotel and expect a 5 star buffet : []
and say Hello to Arini for us : []
After midnight, you would be wakened up by a bird's shouting occasionally (three or four times per night) : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Overall a wonderful resort would definitely go back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Very clean hotel, lovely beach area's, pool area's where large, good for kids beach pool, breakfast included was very good, room was very spacious, but the best thing was the staff, the service was great, and they couldn't do enough for you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The pool is just few meters away from the beach ( in other hotels pool is not so close) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
For people who are looking to do serious swimming, hit the spa pool : [u'amenities', u'patio']
This resort is a five minute walk from shops and other eateries, and a good 15 minute walk from open air shopping centre with plenty of boutiques and restaurants : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The restaurants provide free transport back to your hotel, which is very useful if you miss the last shuttle leaving Bali Collections at 10 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Only downside we found was the cleaning : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We stayed 5 nights in a Palace suite : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']

Due to the weather (too hot and sunny, not my cup of tea), during free time i prefer to stay at my room, enjoying some little peace of mind : []
The staff and management are attentive to your every need, always anticipating your requests : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The Pizza bar or Italian restaurant (Sandos ?) by the pool is excellent, the pizzas were delicious, you get one free in the package and they cost about 10 to 12 dollars AUD and are great value along with some lovely modern and traditional salads ($7 ish) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Beautiful rooms, great views and architecture, service is excellent, on the beach, would go back in a heartbeat!! : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']

Bit of variety would have been nice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
the hotel give you so called Nusa Dua money, which is very annoying to use, we did not present ours to a hotel restaurant for the discount at the time, so were refused to use them later on when we asked the cashier in the palace club room, this should be easier to work out : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The best option for family and couples vacations : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'others']
The breakfast included with our room was absolutely spectacular : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The rooms are not in line with European 5stars standard! The location is remote from any interesting spots : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
A glass of free refreshing juice next to the beach and enjoy the warm from the sun : [u'location', u'sea']
I believe the culture in Bali tends to lead to outstanding service at many places in Bali : [u'overall', u'culture']
The hotel grounds are beautiful and the hotel buildings although ageing have been well maintained : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We didnt realise this was one of the small hotel of the world when we booked it and were pleasantly surprised!!!! The staff were pleasant : []
From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special : []
We visited the chess bar for a meal and Raja's twice : []
Average service for a minor request : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
During our stay the breakfast was the same everyday, there was little to no change in the offerings : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
On this note, it was very convenient the fact that Nusa Dua has a private and very, oder clinic 3 minutes from the hotel : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The pool was nice, and was clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Bad experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

We went and looked at the main buffet breakfast venue on one morning but looked fairly average and we quickly retreated back to the club lounge : []
There is also a spa area with all sorts of treatments : [u'location', u'general']
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa lies in the secluded area of the same name close to Denpasar airport in Bali : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
NO HAWKERS allowed and everyone we passed was definitely in relaxed holiday mode : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We tried also some restaurants of the other hotels nearbz, but there was nothing of impressing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great resort hotel with a real nice beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']

I preferred Nusa Dua over is surrounds : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
forgetting some small money in room,be sure u'll not find it coming back : []
Nusa Dua is much better to stay at than Kuta these days : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Last night we enjoyed the managers cocktail party, it was great to meet the team that are the grass roots of the company that are extremely interested in what the guests need and love about it here : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

I think all the hotels are still experiencing low levels of trade since the bombing in 2002 : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
com which included 8 nights in a palace suite and a huge amount of inclusions including themed dinners, spa treatments and normal 2 course dinners as well : [u'amenities', u'conference']
A perfect place for families with kids : [u'overall', u'culture']
The spa area is great : [u'location', u'general']
We found the resort to be well maintained with beautiful manicured gardens, an 'oasis like' pool setting and well appointed comfortable rooms : []
The patio chairs were unusable due to them being wet all of the time and smelling of foist : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Restaurants were a bit pricey, but good quality food overall : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Likewise the sellers on the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
it was amazing : []
Still it took 30 minutes of our time to sort out and should not have been necessary : []
Generally, the hotel is well maintained and indeed work to balconies and the Reception flooring was being undertaken whilst we were there : []
The result was outstanding : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool is the same but there is no atmosphere in the hotel it seemed as if everyone was lifeless,no one wanted to upset the other very boring,,the pool staff where very rude and since when does it take 4 staff to be sitting and could not careless attitude,this needs to be addressed, The Chess restaurant was very well priced and the menu great choices staff lovely,the pizza bar was very nice as well : [u'amenities', u'patio']
From the pick up at the airport, Sudakita at check in,Anom at the beach all the staff made an effort to talk to you and make you feel welcomed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stay at the NDBH : []
Also to Tony,Donna,Kez,Jess,Tom and Chrissy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
December wet season no problems - a bit of rain now & then in brief bursts - sometimes very welcome! : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
Beach was well maintained, but quite a bit of seaweed, so not that great during low tide : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
This was my first time in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Some people prefer being close to the pool but it depends on your preference : []
The hotel grounds were well-maintained and the staff friendly : [u'overall', u'safety']
(Not long enough) Booked 2x palace club rooms which where lovely and well worth the extra money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Very nice resport suitable for all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We enjoyed our stay here but one thing we did find was that we became a little bored as for us there was not a lot of evening entertainment : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This being the first resort in the Nusa Dua area it has the best stretch of beach and extensive grounds where you can find tranquility in many uncrowded areas : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
my favourite was the afternoon teas so many choices but i loved there scones so nice they just melted in your mouth : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

They were happy to demonstrate their skills and offer advice regarding the preparation and cooking methods that they employ : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We did speak to other guests which had taken up the luxury escape package which is outstanding value, but we did not get this deal so paid a lot more for our rooms : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Definitely, would recommend this destination and would visit again : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Fingers Crossed! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
I will suggest the hotel to put additional sunbeds, shades and parasols around the pool as it seem to never be enough for all guests : []
We went there as a family with an 11, 16 and 18 year old and they all had a ball in the pool and beach : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Overall, it was a wonderful stay : []
We have just returned from our eight night stay with the luxury escapes deal so many of you are familiar with : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

There was an outstanding selection of restaurants for dinner and lunch still the prices were a bit on the high side : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The bathroom of the deluxeroom is so much better - both shower and tub and open shutters so You get a view of bedroom and even a bit beyond : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Even after seeing the photos, arriving at the resort still blew me away : []
I asked a staff member for a restaurant recommendation outside of the hotel but was told staff are not allowed to make such recommendations : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Negatives were that our room was so far from the pool area and replenishing of the room was not very thorough : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The others have tired room, and some have newly design room, but they don't replace the bed yet : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Buffet breakfast is what everybody tends to enjoy a lot in the mornings which ends at 10:30 giving you plenty of time for a sleep in , a variety of different foods from pastries to eggs and bacon to rice dishes : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Breakfast was nice with sufficient choice of menus : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']

1st the SPA - They are really well organised and provided everything you need down to disposible underware which were great as they could be used after treatment to go into the steam and sauna with : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The banana lounges were plentiful and nicely spread out across the large beach frontage, either on sand, grass or by the pool (especially compared with neighbouring hotels) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']

How the area has changed : [u'location', u'general']
We really had the most wonderful holiday and this hotel was definitely a contributing factor : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There are amany restuarants in the hotel which we used early on in our holiday until we got our bearing and wondered down to the Bali Collection ( aka Bali Centre - 15 minute walk along the beach path) where there are many restuarants about half the price of the hotel; although I didn't think the hotel was that expensive compared top others we have stayed in : []
If you want a hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is the place to go : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But people are the difference and the culture is set at the top management : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort for 10days with a group of 30 family and friends, many of us also have small toddlers : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Agus one of the drivers in particular stood out as safe and had a great sense of humour : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Bargaining is easy, start at about 1/3rd their starting price and work up : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Overall had an amazing holiday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
One minor irritation was that there is no control over children, and some in nappies sitting around the pool bar when this facility in the pool should be for aldults only : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We'll be back again and again : []
Having stayed 3 times previously, all of which where enjoyed greatly , our recent stay the whole experience was an improvement on the previous : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If we are to return to Bali we would only stay at this lovely hotel : []
Staff were extremely attentive and always remembered your name, a really nice touch : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
A definite must, dream holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast was disappointing : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']

We had an ocean view suite and the view was gorgeous : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Thus is the third time that we have stayed at the hotel : []
There are some good restaurants at the collection shopping centre which nearby : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
This year alone i've been to nusa dua for 4 times : []
Local map of outside stalls would be good to walk and see! : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
What i liked least is to go to the main town : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
If you would like to find more to choose from you will have to leave the area and take a walk for about 15-25 minutes to find other restaurants with lower prices (however still high prices for Bali) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast buffet is perfect : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Note: the dinners were included as part of our deal but would be a bit pricey for Bali standards : [u'overall', u'safety']
Top marks for customer service! We were allowed a late checkout of 2pm free of charge as we had a midnight flight on our last day : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
not satisfied with the cleanliness of the room, : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Thank you! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The staff proved friendly and attentive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The beach is very clean with plenty of day beds to relax on : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Food and drink is quite pricey in the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The TV reminded me of one I had as a kid : []
Also, we did not find the hotel, room or pool dated at all, like some other people wrote in their Tripadvisor review : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
It had very nice beach with wounderful view : []
we had a very restful four days : []
The pools were big, the beach private, and because it was off-peak season, there were lots of space for everyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Like those beautiful old chairs, tables, lamps, bathroom fittings and sun-beds : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
When he came with empty glasses without ice, I politely asked him if we could have some ice : []

We were invited to enjoy a soft drink in the Palace Club and will definitely book this package next time; exceptionally friendly and kind manager : []
There is so much to say about this place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
When I stayed in Ubud I got guides for a third of the price who actually gave tours : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The resort displays beauty and was spotless : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Another great thing is the anti-mosquito activity taking place around 5 pm, which leads to having 0 mosquitos throughout your stay in the hotel (heard some of friends' experience in other hotels, where mosquito attacks were a routine) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Beach is quite nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
GREAT, I mean GREAT spa service : []
The staff are very friendly and do everything you ask promptly and with a smile : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Wow once again we have had an amazing time at the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The beach chairs do get claimed early, but we found that the spa pool is open to all guests and was never crowded! It's also shaded and does not allow children : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Very nice hotel in a lovely location : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
- awful loud music from the lounge permeates your room until midnight; : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
- Beautiful grounds which are immaculately kept by an army of staff : [u'amenities', u'conference']
definitely to recommend !! : []
The sandy beach is lovely with a view of one of Bali's volcanoes in the distance on one side and with the beach streching out to the right leading to one of the two peninsulas (a romantic evening walk) : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
I felt there needed to be a bigger gluten free range but everything else was fantastic : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach is clean with crystal clear waters : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Both my husband and I enjoyed our spacious Palace Club Suite room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
So welcome to this kingdom of happiness, relaxation and rejuvenation : [u'overall', u'culture']
Overall, we highly recommend Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa! Will definitely be back in the future! : []
The hotel itself is great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast is served in a lovely morning room, surrounded by fish pools, waterfalls and fountains : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We didn't bother as we were very happy where we were : []
You lay out in the sun, but cannot get in the water because of sea urchins : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

My wife and I have been to Bali on eight occasions : [u'overall', u'culture']
Returned to the hotel after a number of years and was once again enchanted by our visit : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Went for our honeymoon and it was perfect : []
The resort does a very good job at hiding its age (30 this year) and has many restaurants, a few pools, a tennis court, a gym and a spa : [u'amenities', u'pool']
There's a million things I could write but it's better you discover them yourself (if you want more info about hotel, read the review I wrote last year which is more detailed) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Breakfasts were great and overall we rated it as a great holiday : []
It totally ruined our holiday after that! : []
Nusa Dua is an established tourist area with many elegant hotels and the clientele reflect that (no Bintang singlets here!) however, you would be hard pressed to find a hotel with as much get away garden space (shaded if you so choose) and beach frontage in Nusa Dua, as the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
A very nice place! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Yes it's a very old hotel but I dont know it still on my priority hotel list to come when I visit to Nusa Dua area in Bali : []
We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights (from 23 March 2014) : []
Bali Collection centre is great, not that cheap, but only 15 min walk for food and shopping : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We complained the staff the following morning and were shown another room which was the same, I explained to the hotel staff the problem again and we were then shown another room which was fine : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel is very nice and big with beautiful garden, pool, and beach : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They are marvellous : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
A brilliant effort by all involved : []
I did put my 5 year old daughter in the kids club while I went shopping in Kuta : []
This could be bad as well : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed in a Palace Room which well appointed, good size and great attention to detail by the room attendants : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Staying in this hotel as our annual retreat since the last 7yrs, we enjoy the very relaxing environment, esp beach walk, yoga, spa,hospitality, and is a place that make ppl like us to come back : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
everything from welcome greetings to the end is absolutely perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only part I did not enjoy was the sea, the beach was great and clean and as soon as the seaweed came in it was removed by cleaners on the beach : []
If you feel like walking, it will only take you 15 minutes : []
Rooms are of decent size with all the usual amenities : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The swimming pools are quite large and clean : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Beautiful Balinese "gates" as you approach the hotel, and a wonderful large, and more traditional style foyer : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
We ( 2 adults, 2 toddlers) stayed in the Palace Club Suite over Christmas, I dont have a single bad word to say about this hotel : []
The resort ground was nice with pools facing the beach : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We asked for a room with a king size bed : []
It is a mere 10 minute walk away : []
Again, the grounds are truly beautiful and you'd love wandering about : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
friendly, helpful staff, nice restaurants, great spa/gym, easy hotel to move around with everything at our finger tips : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The less +: : []
One was a regular type from the wall and the second one was allowed you to sit down in (if you wanted), truly amazing and very big and roomy : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This is a beautiful resort, layout, location, and available amenities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel can arrange taxis or day drivers, but we found it easy and cheaper to arrange our own (just go down to the taxi carpark and ask : []
We arranged transport to the hotel by the hotel car and also used him for a half day trip around Bali & he was excellent in every respect : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
They can provide lunch for your kids at a price (I ordered Nasi Goreng at IDR 60,000 something - nett, other western food is available) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We can fed the fishers, fish food is available at the bell counter : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Overall you get a fair value for the price : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
It is a short walk to the Bali Collection - turn to the right at the beach side of the hotel and keep walking : []
a little salty but typical resort prices : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Staff at th hotel went above and beyond! Particularly the housekeeping boys who always asked if we were ok and if we needed anything for the room : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This was also an annoyance when relaxing on the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The air condition in the room feels very welcoming after the heat outdoor : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
We just got back yesterday after spending a week at this resort in the Palace Club : []
Everything was going as planned : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hotel's staffs front-desk, cleaning, and restaurants are polite and ready to help : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The most important thing we like to stay here is becase it is just a few walks away from the Bali International Convention Center : []
Resort spa was the best and hanging out at the spa pool was quiet and relaxing : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
It was really beautiful : []
This is a big help when you're traveling with toddlers : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My Mum & I stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for 6 nights after 2 weeks in Seminyak on our trip to Bali in January 2012 : [u'location', u'sea']
However the room condition was not good, since I travelled with my 17 month daughter, I was disappointed, the kettle needs replacing(lime scale buildup), the bathrooms deep cleaned and the bathroom accessories replaced : [u'overall', u'culture']
However, some of the recently posted reviews started to give me doubts - there was no need to worry : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I hope my experience is useful for you : [u'overall', u'feel']
Outside of the resort I found everyone to basically to be a liar and a con man : []
We booked an all day tour through the hotel and our guide, Putu, was such a sweet and friendly guy : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Over-all we had a wonderful experience here and would definitely stay here again if we return to Bali at some stage : []
The deluxe rooms are the basic rooms but are pleasant and clean and well air conditioned, which is very important : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The pools are great, we spent the first 2 days near the larger pool and moved over to the grass area for the remainder as it was very hot early afternoon and on the grass area there is more shade : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Highly recommend yoga each morning and the cycling tour should not be missed : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
4 nights at your stunning resort is never enough : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
They had live Balinese music in the lobby : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
All staff was genuine kind to all visitors : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The hotel is more traditional, with beautiful furnishings throughout the common areas : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We enjoyed our monday night the most dinner and show in the outdoor theatre was like a dream ! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'amenities', u'banquet']
The second day I could feel the difference as cleaner had made the room during daytime : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
I visited the hotel for a week of R&R with my husband : []
The welcome we had from staff was wonderful, we were welcomed as friends who were special : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I was reluctant to even use the grey, old towels and face clothes : []
Just perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Lovely private beach (bigger than other luxury hotels and more private and exclusive), at the end of the "busy" hotel strip at Busa Dua Hotel area : [u'location', u'general']
We had late lunch in one of the restaurants : []
We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast and were very happy with the theme dinners that were part of our Luxury Escape package : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
In May we spent 2 weeks booking Palace Club, and it was better choise than one might expect : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Nothing is to much for them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The entire Club Team is to be commended for their exceptional customer service : [u'location', u'sea']
Fine if you don't want the real Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They had selected middle eastern specialities and mangled them with their own adaptations : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
It has a prime beachfront location and is quite large : []
It was not clean either : []
Second visit (first April 2009) : [u'location', u'sea']
The beach are clean and calm : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']

The pools are great and so is the garden : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Breakfast was super : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Lots of spare pool lounges - children under 12 not allowed in this area : [u'location', u'general']
The breakfast was average but particularly poor was the appearence of unripe tropical fruit at every serving : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Lovely gardens, pools, statues and water features : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The main pool has a swim-up bar, and is large enough to not feel in each other's pockets : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
* overal service and welcome are perfect : []
It is amazing : []
In conclusion, it's a very nice resort : []
The breakfast buffet was superb : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We look forward to returning on our next trip to Bali : []
Room service and the cleanliness of our room was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
This is the second time we have stayed here : []
It was cleaned and otherwise ready but it seemed an employee of the hotel has used the room: there was half eaten fruits on the table and clearly someone has been taken naps in the bed : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
Old loungers, but enough for guests : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The food options and quality were amazing : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff were amazing and we made great friends with Astawa at the pool bar who ended up taking us on a tour of Bali for FREE!! Everyone always said hello when you walked past with a big smile on their face which was so nice to see : [u'amenities', u'patio']
A very sunny outside seating area and quiet outside garden areas were really picturesque : [u'location', u'general']
We would recomend the Nusa Dua Cafe for dinner which is just inside the gates of Nusa Dua, $30 : [u'amenities', u'conference']
would I go back again , and I would 100% the food the staff swimming pool beach are all incredible : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Beautifully landscaped grounds and well kept : [u'overall', u'safety']
Pizza at the Italian eatery was good! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We also soon discovered that prices in Nusa Dua, whether it be spa facilities, restaurants or even drinks, were generally higher than elsewhere on the island : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff are friendly and very helpful, and the grounds are pristine : [u'overall', u'safety']
And would advise caution when paying : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Steaks and seafood were terrific, cocktails generous and worth any guest trying this part of the hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There are some pleasant walks but if you are looking for shooping etc Nusa Dua is not the place : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The breakfast buffet was also out of this world : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We arrived home this morning from Nuca Dua Hotel and spa Bali : []
Ok a little about us, Male 34 and new Wife 31 : []
Very relaxing, quite, yummy, spacious, entertaining : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The cereal choice was poor though : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
But was easy enough to get taxi/driver when needed : []
Pool was always clean but wish there was more lunge chairs : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Remember you can bargain too! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I paid extra to stay in the Palace Club rooms, but it was NOT worth the money I paid each night of almost $400 : []
The breakfast is also in a wonderful setting, and I never found it too noisy : []
just about 4 star : [u'overall', u'culture']
It is naturally tidal and at its best at high tide, but low tide is ok also : []
We generally liked to take a walk out of the hotel and its not as far as the hotel staff make out to you : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The gardens are manicured and well maintained : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Plenty to do for all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I have stayed in a variety of accommodations and types when on holidays : []
) And then there was a happy hour with horderves and drinks from 5 : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
This is a great hotel for a really relaxing holiday we would highly reccommend it : []
Always had a lounge or shade at anytime that we went to the pool or beach even in the afternoons after naps : []
This is by far the best Hotel in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The room was filthy dirty with something really nasty on the floor A spill of some kind : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I agree that these prices are more expensive than you find outside the hotel, they are very cheap comapred to some other hotels we have stayed at in Nusa Dua : []
While this may have been a 4+ star in a former life it is now at best 3 : []
I know they have a captive market with the coal conference, but given the fact that I had staff in 10 rooms for at least 5 nights each, I felt we got no better treatment, service or attention than someone that a last minute arrival would have : [u'amenities', u'banquet']
You can still visit Kuta in a local taxi for around no more than AUD$10 each way : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My daughters wedding was held at this hotel : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
there was a slight mix up and we should have got a deluxe room but as it had been booked, they upgraded us again to the palace room : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The room was very clean and we'll maintained by house keeping : []
Very good stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We've been back for more than a fortnight now, but every day Indonesia is still on our minds : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
All of Staff are kind and smile to you : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
During check in and check out the experience was bad : [u'overall', u'feel']
The Restaurants are run and served by very friendly and professional staff : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
with have private beach and nice breakfast ,went staying there there is wedding party just front our room but happy can listening music I really recommended this hotel for holiday : []
I felt very safe here : []
Staff overwhelmingly friendly,helpful : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We would definitely stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa again for a relaxing holiday : []
There are 3-4 restaurants inside the hotel but again good for non-vegetarian people only :), : []
The staff were invariable friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
My kids love the beach so much, they practically spending most of the time getting wet in the beach and pool : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Beach good at high tide (no swimming in low tide) : [u'location', u'sea']
The rooms wre extremely large and well serviced, all staff were very friendly and helpfull would certainly recommend for families as the hotel is very secure and extremely beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel pools were so clean and staff cleaning the paths and the beach made it pretty all the time : [u'location', u'sea']
We've stayed three times and the quality always remains up to scratch : [u'location', u'sea']
Great gesture from the hotel when they upgraded us to a Deluxe Room to a Premier Room where the room was much bigger : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The room is huge and so is the hotel : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Do not reccommend this hotel if you want any other hotel around the world to compare, above and beyond this hotel is I have stayed here twice with my partner both in our 20s as a getaway from work and responsibilities it hit the nail on the head : []
It included 3 theme nights with shows and dinner and they were all great : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Theme nights were entertaining especially our Christmas Dinner : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
But, there are some things need the hotel to do more about its hardwares : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We travelled to Bali a little unexpectedly and had quite a choice of hotels in this secure holiday enclave of Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
- The hotel Location is wonderful : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
The Spa what can I say only that it was heaven well worth going to this hotel to be pampered and treated like honoured guests We were given tea before and after and we could use the Spa pool which was very private : [u'amenities', u'conference']
These are the sort of things that can and do go wrong when on holidays and this is the sort of place I want to be when travelling with children : []
Beautiful and spread-out property with various options of restaurants, welcoming staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff (with very few exceptions) is great, the grounds and facilities look equally impressive, breakfast is very nice, and the beach is cleaned several times per day : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
For disabled people (and even some able bodied people) it was : []
A quite "No Thanks" usually suffices and you are left alone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you want to try local resteraunts, you can enjoy the free pick up and return service from them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Originally mainly farmland and mangroves, it has in the last two decades become the hotspot for many 5 star luxury resorts : [u'amenities', u'pool']
They were more than happy to hold our luggage for us all day : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We had issues in communicating with the hotel staff before our check-in : []
The food was good if a bit pricey and the staff were very pleasant and efficient : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff are good : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The grounds and view from the room of the lake and gardens was serene : [u'overall', u'safety']
However, the Front Desk staff was not less accommodating than I had hoped, having booked a large group stay here : []
I would like to visit the hotel again : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Here's a little tip, let them know beforehand if you'd like them to avoid 'certain areas' like tender chest area (you feel me, ladies?) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All people were very friendly and helpfully : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Clean facility : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
We opted for a Palace Room, and the all-day Tea & Coffee, afternoon tea and evening cocktails were excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
They wait on you hand and feet! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We were given an upgraded room change due to music entertainment very loud as our room was close to reception : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
I ordered a cocktail, & 2 juices for the kids from the swim up bar & it cost $23! It was $9 : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Ok so it's only been half a day, so I may be critiquing a little early but I couldn't help myself : []
The Executive Chef was really helpful and accommodated our daughter's need to have gluten free food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
If you're with your family, an incredible kids club (gecko Club), with fabulous staff - a huge variety in activities that will keep your children amused & intrigued, especially Culturally! Baby sitters available and bikes to hire : []
It's the biggest deluxe room I've ever stayed, it also have the balcony : []
Stayed here in early November, and was really enjoyable : [u'location', u'sea']
We have just returned from staying at the Nusa Dua and although our experience ultimately turned out to be a good one, there were some problems : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Good value for money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We stayed over the Christmas/New Year period : []
My last comment is about the location : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
First, the staff are just gorgeous : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
It is a bit of a con to get you to buy into a timeshare so dont fall for it!! : []
Nice kingsize bed and many closets to our clothes : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This place is decorated in traditional Balinese style and you really feel you are away from it all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
What a lovely hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We have just returned home after 2 weeks in Bali ,5 nights at Nusa Dua Hotel : []
The best nights ever as I slept through like a baby : []
One of the receptionists asked if we had enjoyed our stay and when we told her about the state of the room she said it's because we had booked a Standard Room : []
The facilities are great and you get the Balinese feel and ambiance even by just walking around the resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Sometimes they would turn their back to you halfway when you were still talking to them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Which leads to the second gripe : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We tried the Embrace spa package for 2 pax for 2 : []
Meals there were very good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We really liked this hotel the food was good although a little pricey : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
I visited a few other hotels including the Bale, the Westin and Club Med and I think that would be fair : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
1) as my wife and I celebrated our 1st Anniversary in Bali, the hotel granted us an upgrade for a Deluxe Room instead of the Superior we paid for : []
If you walk by the beach you can compare the resorts and the activities you can see how other resorts are more organized and luxurious : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Best thing we enjoyed was the uncrowded swimming pools - my toddler had great fun waddling around in the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
- Room did not have a modern feel like the other hotels we stayed at in Kuta & Ubud : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']

One pool was closed while we were there but we never had any trouble finding somewhere in the shade to sit : []
The hotel manager categorically refused to give us some sort of refund! So we will be leaving the hotel 3 nights before our planned departure and not even one night will be refunded : [u'overall', u'culture']
The poolside bar has the best lunches and great prices, and you can't beat eating on the beach lawn, overlooking the cool blue waters : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua is a peaceful area and the Resort a good choice for a family holiday : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
I would definitely go back to the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa again : []

While there we did a one day trip to Ubud (temples, monkey park, handicrafts, market), which was really nice, and should be considered a "must" : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Good pools and beach amenities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we will come back again : []
If you demand a 5-star resort, you will probably want to look elsewhere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The free internet although slow was still good and we were able to check in online for our return flights with Singapore Airlines and print off the boarding passes : []
The gardens and grounds are very well kept : [u'amenities', u'garden']
Both were fantastic : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']

These places offer a free shuttle service and the hotel staff are happy to call them for you : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They hassled & followed us even after we were polite & said 'no thank you' many times : []
I requested a firmer pillow and extra quilts (we prefer sleeping in a cold room with heavy quilts) and housekeeping were happy to help : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Bali Collection is only a 10 minute walk away for alternative restraunts and supermarket supplies : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We booked 6 nights in a palace club room as you pay a bit extra but then get things like free soft drinks, canapes and cocktails in the evening, afternoon tea and breakfast : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We asked about calm room and got view to small pond where ducks are at home : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub']
We felt safe as a family the location was perfect we could leave the resort & come back in the night & felt safe especially having young children : []
Quieter and more pleasant breakfast, great way to cool down in the arvo with a drink and canapes, plus pre-dinner happy hour is ideal : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
its like alice in wonderland : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'others']
Must commend the spa staff for their friendly professionalism, as well as the quality of services on offer, which we found reasonably priced : []
This hotel is older than some of the nearby ones, but it has the charm the other's don't : []
We asked for another room and they then gave us a replacement room which was not the one we booked for : []
Scrambled eggs, sausages, mushrooms, hash-browns, bacon, toast, beans : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
So relaxing we didn't leave the hotel : []
I had to buy a lemon for gin and tonics on the odd time I went for cocktails, afternoon tea spoiled our dinner so we didn't bother : []
However, two gripes: the food inhouse is generally unremarkable : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The morning was my favorite time of day at the hotel : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
We will definitely come back and stay there again : []

We only ate at two of the restaurants (Chess bar and the Pizza bar) and were happy to be able to get local food as well as pizzas and/or fish & chips when the kids were tired of local food : [u'overall', u'culture']
and something for all tastes/ nationalities : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Rooms: Very large, comfortable and spacious : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My room was first class (single room, king bed, walk-in shower, hardwood floor, balcony), the service was cheerful, courteous, and ever-present : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The room was clean and spacious and well thought out in design (separate toilet/shower/bath and window from bathroom into the main room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
So relaxing, so blissful : [u'location', u'sea']
The breakfast was excellant, couldnt fault it : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
We could have gone anywhere but decided to return to the NDBH on short notice and could not have been happier with our decision : []
There was lot's of wildlife in the peacful gardens and grounds and plenty of room round both pool areas : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As for alternative dining options (we stayed 10 nights) Bali Collection shopping resort is accessible by courtesy bus a few minutes away with a huge rannge of international dining options : [u'amenities', u'pool']
So no sitting on the balcony : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'amenities', u'patio']
I went during the off season so the resort overall was on the quiet side : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The furniture in the room we stay in was a bit too rustic for a 5* hotel (although everything was in working condition and the design was very pleasing), and there were other small nuisances which came after an exciting stay in the jungle : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Service in the club lounge was exceptional, very good breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapes and cocktails : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Generally speaking for one of the first 5 star properties at nusa dua this place has been well maintained & managed : []
I and my husband stayed in the hotel for 5 nights starting Dec 18 : []
This hotel was only booked on the Wednesday before staying on the Saturday : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The resort has a great feel to it : [u'amenities', u'pool']
This was our first trip to Indonesia (let alone Bali) and we were traveling with a 2-yr old, so we thought it better to splurge a little and pay for a nicer place where we wouldn't have to worry about anything : []
Once you are at Bali Collection, there are plenty of options to eat at a third of the price of the hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Nusa Dua is the best example of the balinese hospitatlity the staff, food, spa,bars,landscaping,Restaurants & especially the evening market which they set up everything is simply amazing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel has many different restaurants and bars but they are all quite expensive (it is after all a 5 star hotel) : []
The staff are all very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I will recommend this Hotel and will stay there again if coming to Bali once more : []
It's a nice hotel for families and couples, if you are interested on shopping of cause better to stay at kuta or seminyak ,and if you are looking for a quite holidays,would recommend : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Management need to pay more attention to these details : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Hotel atmosphere excellent, neat gardens with nice ponds and great tree flowers : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Did this put me off coming back (def : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a wander into and around many of the hotels during our stay and this one is the best by far : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
While I personally hated the "rainfall" shower head, the rest of the room was beautiful : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Well located with a nice beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
most of the activities are paid tho except the gym,table tennis and beach volley : [u'amenities', u'gym']
The place is clean, peaceful and romantic (for couples) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Spa has lockers, showers, sauna, steam room, a hot and cold pool that fits maybe 3 people comfortably : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The friendliness and service of the staff is second to none, everyone was so attentive and helpful : []
Stayed there for 5 days : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
One of our reason to choose this hotel was the Raja Balinese resturant which offer halal food for Muslims and we wanted to try the Balinese food that is halal : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It's a good idea to make a reservation : []
This is unfair, and something the hotel should stop : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
But the sea is only good to swim at the morning til noon, since at the afternoon they go low on tide (maybe its seasonal effect) : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The main entrance with the Candi Bentar and the foyer, just wonderful! : []
we are so disappointment and will never return here : []
Within Nusa Dua Beach hotel, there is a restaurant by the beach named "Chess" and there is live music during the evening : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
Lastly, the traditional Balinese dance shows during dinnertime were amazing : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Starting the day with 20 laps of the lap pool then to a great breakfast, hire a bike and go for a ride down the promenade a bit of bargaining with the locals back to the hotel to the pools and a few bintangs, awesome, of the hotels we stayed at over our 3 weeks away from nz this hotel would have been the best for service and friendly staff : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The local shops are located just outside the gate and the tourist strip at Tangung Benoa is close by : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
However for those who just want to relax and stress relieve you could not find better, as mentioned the grounds and ambience are just stunning : [u'overall', u'safety']
The hotel is Immaculate : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The spa, pool and beach facilities were brilliant : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel ambience makes you feel that you are in Bali : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Hotel's biggest asset is the staff : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We loved the breakfast & the staff there was very courteous & friendly, the pool was wonderful but not enough sun deck chairs : []
Which in case of this resort is worth the money: : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We would happily recommend this hotel - but only if you are looking for an indulgent experience in a heavenly setting! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
usual cards : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Very warm staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is Located about 25 minutes by taxi (approx A$10 : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
And we were sad to leave : []
We had breakfast included which I recommend as it can get pricey : []
It was quite safe in Bali, much better than Malaysia : []
We had our breakfast in the Main open air Restaurant overlooking the shaped lilyponds, and the choice was overwhelming : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
the place is amazing but a little bit scary when i walked alone from my room (2212) to the mart, i think you should put some lights more :( but overall, the place and the services are great, the staff helped me a lot and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There were only a few people there and it is so quiet and peaceful : []
Similarly the service and ambience at the SPA is excellent : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
This is a full on resort on a large beach with large pools, multiple programmed activities and restaurants : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Damp quilt : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms were quite spacious and well appointed with a balcony overlooking the gardens, unfortunately we were also overlooking the service block of the hotel next door : []
Spa has been renovated, also staff I think, not much smiling there, pool is better than before, very lovely also showers and Sauna are ok, but somethind cold is there, when you walk at Spa, nobody notice you can just walk and go to sundeck or Sauna, I was ther 4-5 times, same everytime, didnt use massage service, first time that didnt use service, wife had onetime massage, all gone okey, but after there wasnt time to relax, hurry to go and pay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There is also 2 toddlers pools and a swim up bar : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
30 AM, We loved the omelettes specially made to order with your own mixture : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
this is one of the best 5 star hotels in Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Came back to Nusa Dua after 30 years : [u'location', u'sea']
They have a free shuttle that goes to Bali Collection which is a good shopping complex with lots of restaurants and shops : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The breakfast is excellent so is the hotell area : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
When staying at the hotel you should visit the restaurant Bumbu Bali, they pick u up at the hotel, then drive u back : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They are all looking a bit shabby for a 4 star hotel : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Our room was clean and modern with everything you could need for your holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is one of the most beautiful and luxurious places to stay and not a deep hole in your wallet : []
In most reviews, Nusa Dua is told to have the best sea in Bali, but the sea was much better in Seminyak : [u'location', u'sea']
The breakfast was probably the most extensive I have come across in my time and that is really saying something : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
All added up to a substandard hotel experience : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The pools are large and there are a number of options : [u'location', u'sea']
Other than that, I recommend this place for a chill out family holiday : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Good selection at restaurants and the food was very good : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
The room was a good size and we had a lovely view on to the Duck pond from the balcony which had two chairs and a table : [u'amenities', u'conference']
They leave us with a message in the room before the check-out date to let us know we can still stay in the hotel lounge after check-out and extended discount for massage in the hotel, etc : []
The largely open reception area, covered with a roof but open to to the air all around, was refreshingly different : [u'location', u'general']
Overall, the experience from staying at the hotel was very positive and would definitely recommend it : [u'overall', u'feel']
If it weren't for the poor service and the rooms which were not up to standard this hotel would have been rated 4 or 5, just expected better for the money we paid out : []
staff are all old and very slow : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The resort ground is huge and provides ample space for everyone : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
It was a bit of work for me to get in, but ALL my valuables were intact : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
All staff members was friendly, helpful and attentive : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The rooms are rather dated, I was somewhat unhappy when we arrived (11:30pm), but my opinion of the place changed when the sun came up : [u'location', u'sea']
Try the seafood restaurant at the entrance of Bali collection where the resort has shuttle bus every hour : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Pizzas slightly burnt and we had to send it back as my daughter asked for no oregano : [u'overall', u'culture']
The property has its own beach front and it is amazing to see the expanse of clean, swept, golden sand beach with very few people : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Happy hour bar snacks are really yummy but happy hour drinks not cheap - normally you can get 2 for 1 - nothing like that here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Limited seating at pool area which had to spend time to locate : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Styaffs are freindly, fun pools for my two little ones : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Finding available lounge chair was a bit of a crapshoot : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Well done guys, we will be back : []
Good location, nice beach (although when it was low tide it was difficult to swim : []
Gecko Kids Club was interesting : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Ok let's be frank here : []
If we needed something we would just call and they would have it at our room within a reasonable time : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
A great place for romance and to recharge the batteries : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Huge living room and bedroom : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The grounds are amazing : [u'overall', u'safety']
thank you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for the good hospitality! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Also it cost about 100,000 rp every time to wants to cross to the other side os island : [u'location', u'sea']
The hotel also have various of water activities like diving, canoing, surfing and snorkeling : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Staff are very friendly and the chamber man is very helpful : [u'overall', u'culture']
Only complaint would be didn't book for long enough (8 days) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were all really nice and accommodating : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Instead I walked two minutes to the beach (go to beach and turn left, walk a minute and ladies will flock - you should pay between 50,000-80,000 rupiah for an hour - $5 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As you are driven up the entrance of this Hotel, beautiful gardens and statues will automatically set the scene for an amazing holiday : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The Hotel though seems dated in parts is still full of charms and we would like the authenticity and feel of Bali retained : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Unlike the bad experience I had on Kuta beach : []
It was like the food budget had been cut and it showed in the food that was being served : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed 9 night at Nusa Dua Beach : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
(We even enjoyed the Discovery Partika in Kuta more than the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel) : []
This is an excellent hotel, rooms are lovely, clean and modern & pools/gardens are beautiful! I was traveling with my partner and my parents - All of us were very happy with quality of service and surrounds : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We love the rooms, the food and the excellent friendly staff who always give us a warm welcome : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Went to Bali for a friends wedding in October 2011 : [u'overall', u'culture', u'amenities', u'recreation']
Afternoon tea in the club lounge was exceptional and the club lounge is in the most beautiful setting : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
The hotel landscaping was unique and gave a true Balanese experience : [u'overall', u'feel']
Compared to other hotels in Bali surely one of the best in top class! We've spent wonderful 10 days in this Hotel : [u'amenities', u'conference']
we took the free shuttle from the hotel to the nearby bali collection mall twice which is nice to have a look around the shops and have dinner - it is a little cheaper than the hotel : []
The food and beverage on offer in the Palace Club is of a high standard and always a lot of variety : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Excellent service and delicious buffet breakfast : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
So to summarize, I would recommend this hotel to anybody, who is considering a visit to Bali : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Then the hard decisions commenced, would I swim, wind surf, paddle board or read under the trees on the sand : [u'location', u'sea']
It was perfect for us : []
We loved both the pools and the beach and we thought the food was superb : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
They were well -trained and could read body languages well : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They have a different theme each evening but they didn't have a sauce with them so they were a bit dry : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I would not hesitate to come back again, if ever I should visit wonderful Bali : []
The pools and spa were wonderful : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Would go back any time : [u'location', u'sea']
Food was good but wih the 21% tax ended up being expensive as were the drinks : []
As many others have stated beautiful surroundings for breakfast,afternoon high tea and evening cocktails : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We will definetly : []
The resort credit was $10 U : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Room was excellent : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
thats would be a very great moment for us when staying here until this weekend : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We very much enjoyed our stay at the hotel : []
We celebrated our daughters wedding in Nuas Dua : []
Very relaxing, massage and spa facilities excellent; food and service excellent : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The facilities were incredible : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Our only complaint about the room would be that the bathroom vanity is too small, the comfort of the bed more than compensated for this : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So in writing this we had a full week here and still one week to go : []
From the room to the pool to the breakfast, everything was perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Report of Nusa Dua Beach and Spa Hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Just one word : EXCELLENT HOTEL : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I had a ground-floor room opening out onto the pool area : []
The pool at the spa is amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Pools were ok : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
It's a good idea to get in early (before 7 : []
We also climbed Mount Batur, the island's 2nd highest volcano, albeit not at sunrise, as seems to be the norm : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The pools are vast, warm and inviting : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The area of Nusa is immaculate and well maintained : [u'location', u'general']
we had a standard room : []
We loved the pool area and the ability to chill out under a lovely old tree under the beach : []
And this hotel does not disappoint : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Beach: Generally the beach was poor but at times it looked lovely : []
The other is a "fake beach" which must be perfect for people travelling with children : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The spa was beautiful and so the treatments so cheap : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
15 min walk to shopping centre (bali collection which is more western in that the prices are fixed and there is no aggressive sales people) and art museum : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The reception staff discriminates between asian and Whites, former has a luke warm reception the later one gets a welcome drink and garland around his neck : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff at Nusa Dua were really helpful and went out of their way to make it a special and memorable holiday : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
nice (although a bit pricey ) : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
After 3 attempts to move us (first, to a smoking room where we were told to just open the windows, second to a room that was 1/2 the size of the one we were initially given, and much to small for 3 of us, and finally, after fully packing, they attempted to move my daughter and her family to a room close to us, that was again, too small for them) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food is acceptable even if the only significant experience is breakfast : [u'overall', u'feel']
Nusa Dua isn't reflective of the 'real' Bali, however it is a wonderful place to relax : []
The food was good; this resort was really valuable for money you spend on there : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Walking it would only take 10-15 minutes : []
The staff in the Palace Club always treated as if we were the most important people in the Club : []
The accommodation was perfect : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
we came home feeling completely un-wound and relaxed : []
if i would ever come back to Bali i would not consider anything else : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
made the mistake of trying a villa for part of a holiday but we ended up back at the Nusa Dua beach hotel! : []
It is a very large hotel which is almost always full yet the staff still have a special way of making us feel as though we are the only guests staying there : []
From the arrival everything was just perfect, private transfer from the Airport, wonderfull reception with a tropical fruit drink, a great room with a well chilled bottle of champagne and above all , a great staff with a very good knowledge and practice of what customer focus means : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The breakfast is an extra-ordinary one to enjoy every morning : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Rooms were in need of a revamp, old floor boards + bath rooms : []
Next time I would probably try out one of the other hotels along the strip if staying for longer but several years later the service is still very good and me enjoyed our short stay : []
The staff are amazing and so friendly and helpful whilst maintaining professional standards : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
+ good price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thanks to you all! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel is the "oldest" of the newer huge resorts in Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The air conditioner didn't work, the shower was clogged which flooded the bathroom and you got the opportunity to have your own 'pool' in your room, wading in lord knows what : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The style of the room itself is nice and modern but condition of the furnishings bring it down a lot : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
Both the chess bar and restaurant serve good food and drink but service is slow and not just for us : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
You can take a 10 min walk down de beautiful beach an you are in the Bali Collection Centre where you can shop and eat in lots of restaurants with live music : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Will definitely return : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Huge variety in breakfast!!! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
They are too crowded but ur the party types then those are the areas for you, sply Kuta : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The complex is large and we were a long way from the main pool area, but still the room was perfect, the view over the gardens was lush and we even had squirrels to watch! : []
Everything about our stay went smoothly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
wonderful atmosphere and service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Both with plenty of bars, restaurants, supermarkets etc : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Our room was sufficient for the little time we spent in it : []
The food was superb and our high light was dinning in the Balinese Restaurant at the Resort : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Obviously the massage at the markets is not as lush as the one at the hotel's day spa but they are pretty good all the same, particularly if you take your own scented oil (i : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The overall hotel would benefit from a more attention to detail and using the 'Palace Club' as a 'standard' : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We went because we needed a break : []
Highly Recommend The Palace Club - A Wonderful breakfast buffet in such a serene location overlooking the duck pond : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Massages were available in the spa of the hotel or more basic / cheaper option was available on the beach : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Hoverer, all the pools are very well maintained : []
Smoking is prohibited in public areas however this is not enforced at all : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort is lovely, the beach is clean and nice, and there are so many restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The check in process was quite fast and we're allowed to get an early check in : []
I highly recommend this hotel, the staff are wonderful and if you can afford to upgrade to a Palace club room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Other facilities were good as you would expect from a 5 star resort - games room, business centre etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our next trip we will be moving on to the Westin : []
Big garden : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The lounge is open 24/7, so you can pop in for a drink or biscuit or fruit any time you like : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Excellent hotel in every aspect! Your stay there will be memorable as a tropical heaven surrounds you and service is more than perfect! If I was about to repeat my journy in Bali, I would certainly choose again Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The food and service were excellent and all the staff seemed genuinely interested in making our stay enjoyable : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I love everything about Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : []
But the room configuration doesn't really allow for much room to do that : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Word of warning though - don't eat breakfast as the boat is a fast inflatable and can be a bit choppy! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Pool area) are WAY to small concerning the amount of beds that it hosts and also the value for money factor : []
Wonderful property, friendly staff, very good food and beverage quality and service and overall a wonderful family holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
00 to 7 : []
Down sides: not enough lighting : [u'amenities', u'patio']
I think if you want to have the real, cultural, Bali experience you should go to other areas of Bali as well, but Nusa Dua was very relaxing and also a very great part of our holiday : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Facility is true to Bali's culture and is a good balance between the provision of services and facilities and open space : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Thank you again NDBH for your kindness : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I would totally recommend my friends and family to book here : [u'overall', u'culture']
CONS (for some): : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
I decided to wipe down the outside furniture on the balcony with one of the white bath towels : []
BE CAREFUL of the "+ +" when looking at the internet price, we paid the quoted internet price "+ +" 21% for so called taxes!! : [u'amenities', u'internet']
My husband and I stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa in Bali on February 15-17th, 2012 : [u'overall', u'culture']
But everything turns quiet at 9pm : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This breakfast leaves a similar type we had in the Crown Casino in Perth Western Australia for dead : []
All staff were lovely the entire week stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pool area was OK but to be honest even with the supposedly low occupancy rates in Bali at the moment we never got chance to sit by it as the beds were always taken : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
For a very grand hotel it boasts the atmosphere of a small boutique with all the luxuries that a larger hotel offers : []
Also the beautiful gardens and the peace & tranquility of the spa pool : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
The hotel has nice architectural features including a huge Balinese style lobby, lots of restaurants and pools : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We hired bikes for about $7aus for an hour for two : []
The wooden decoration inside the room was beautiful, I am sure it cost a lot of money to have such marvelous decor : []
If you want to shop at Kuta area bk the transfer from tour desk is cheaper than taksi : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Buffet breakfast is included at the Wedang Jaye restaurant : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Apart from that a beautiful hotel and we cant wait to return : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
i didn't want it to end by the time we finished : []
Our suite although spacious and clean could do with a modern update and still reflect the Balinese style : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Have just come back from 6 nights staying at The Nusa Beach Hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Breakfast buffett was very expansive and had lots of different choices each day : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The massages were wonderful and the pools and the grounds overall were beautiful : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
shuttle service to the nearby bali collection shopping arcade was available for free : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The pool and beach are lovely and no doubt the new beach club will be lovely when its completed : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Though do note regarding the Main Pool and Lagoon pool that they both close at 7pm : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pools are fine, we had a large group of fat, loud Australians sitting in the pool drinking when we first arrived, this spoiled the atmosphere when you are trying to relax : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This is my second time staying, but I would recommend some music around The pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
Rooms very clean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Water aerobics was a lot of fun : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We enjoyed 2 dinners right on the beach with our feet in the sand : []
The staff are lovely and so friendly - always very accommodating We met Youdana 4 years ago and he remembered us and looked after us so well at the Chess Bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Had a great stay there, would definitely recommend : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Taxi's - This hotel ups the prices and provides their own! which I have to say is a really disappointing feature, although the hotel cars are larger and roomier, but not necessary for short trips : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup', u'post-room', u'checkout']
Their attention detail and all the little touches added up to an amazing stay : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We actually found it a bit too quite for us although we are in our mid 50's - 60's traveled as 2 couples : []
Our grandchildren loved the Kids Club and we felt safe leaving them there : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I was with my spouse and mother : []
We will return to this hotel again! We feel a soul connection to Bali and its people : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I was furious! : []
The only issue we had was the wi-fi which worked very badly in the lobby area and was not available at all at the rooms : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We spent 7 nights at this resort and from the moment of arrival we were in love with the place : []
All the food we ate in a variety of the Hotel's restaurants and Bars was a very high standard, though I would have liked to see a different dinner and lunch menu at Chess Bar and Restaurant as when you ate at the Bar in the day it was the same menu in the outside Restaurant in the evening : []
The staff are out of this world and will go to any length to make sure your every need is cared for : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There is a supermarket in the complex but it had a limited range : []
We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for a week and had a lovely time : []
Every day we were greeted by name and welcomed into the Palace Club : []
The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I highly recommend the Palace Club, and compared to other resorts, probaly the most affordable club on offer : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
the airconditioning brought wet air into the room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
But they are far from rude or persistent and a swift no thank you moves them on : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There were around 4 restaruants and enjoyed the seafood and Kacek dance on our last night : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This year we purchased a special and went to Nusa Dua : []
Needless to say we never ate dinner at the hotel we just ate at these events : []
Had a bit of construction going on so detracted from the view a bit : [u'room-experience', u'view']
Everything is kept in very : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
If you go to Bali Collection you can get a massage for about $30AUD and if you go to the markets you can get one for about $6AUD : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But i think it suits me who travels alone during this trip : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The room was nicely furnished with a good size lounge area, seperate bedroom and large, clean well appointed bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
The club was another high point for us, the staff are really gracious and look after you the whole time, the breakfasts are really nice, both a buffet and a menu, with a good selection of fresh juices and according to my wife the best selection of organic teas she has ever tasted, with her personal favourite being the 'Asian Breakfast' : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Hotel facilities very good especially the bar in the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The resort's beach isn't very nice but is good to explore at low tide if you are after water sports this is the place to be with all the activities available right at the beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
He is genuinely interested in people and cares about the quality of our holiday, making suggestions and recommending various places of interest : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The Restaurants were fine : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
We went on a bike ride with one of the staff as an activity and I highly recommend doing this as you will see the real Bali and some beautiful scenes : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
My 6 year old daughter had her own bed and we had a lovely room looking out onto the pool : []
The automatic coffee maker was even better : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
One small usual problem which i didnt expect was that you have the same old problem of getting sunbeds round the pool, and as there was only about three familys of the usual suspects at this resort, (you know who i mean ) i guess this is now a world wide problem which cant be labelled at one particular nation : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We have travelled around the world the past 20 years and rate our stay at Nusa Dua Beach Resort one of our most memorable : []
Close to Bali Collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Everyone was very helpful and nice : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However its a typical laid back easy going resort where you can enjoy a nice spa, time by the beach and relish some lovely food at their multiple restaurants serving Indo, Japanese, Italian and western cuisines : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The night we were to leave, our plane was delayed 3 days - we could have stayed anywhere but headed back to the NDBH because of it's : []
Would recommend this resort without hesitation : [u'amenities', u'pool']
talk about a surprise! when i came to relaize the prices vs : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There were other chairs though on the grass and on the beautiful beach so it wasn't too much of an issue : []
Well decorated and designed bedroom with great walk in shower in the bathroom : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Breakfast the following morning was good, but the check out was poor - the computers were down and it took ages to obtain an account showing a nil balance : []
The location and service is second to none, my partner and I loved our time their!! : [u'location', u'sea']
There were many beautiful ornaments and a fountain - good photo spots for my tourist friends! There were two swimming pools, one with a mini basketball ring and a net (for watersport) : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Overall, we will be back!!! : []
The biggest highlights for us were: the cuisine and the spa area : []
Although this hotel is older, they did a good job with the upkeep : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
My husband got sick one day and the hotel organised a doctor to the room in 30minutes which was great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The rooms are good : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
A lot of garden, bale-bale, and we're adoring Wedang Jahe Resto for breakfast : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed 7 nights : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
However as the week went on things got better and we enjoyed our stay : []
Nusa Dua is a beautiful residence where you can relax, do a work out (if you like) and have beautiful meals : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It would be our first choice in Nusa Dua : []
The staff in the Palace Club were excellent and certainly made our honeymoon : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Other travelers who witnessed this horrid incident were astonished as well : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Wish I had confirmed this before booking : []
Wonderful stay! We experienced everything and more at Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa! Our package blew us away with more extras than expected, the staff were always prompt in assisting us, the facilities were great - didn't have to leave the resort if we didn't want to, it had everything! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thanks to the reviews, nothing surprised me at the hotel - good service, very comfortable rooms, good breakfast (though I didn't like the beef bacon, give me pork anytime!), nice beachfront, good value for money : []
There is a complimentary shuttle which transports you to Bali collection should you wish to eat outside : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The value for money was the best : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Apart from this we had a greatb 8 day stay : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The Bali Collection is a nice 20 min walk a long the beach promenade, which gives you enough choices for cheaper restaurants : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Kids club is also free, which is a nice added extra : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Only things I could fault were the toilet in our room which had a faulty flushing system, the water ran consistently - and the aircon is set too low and a tad on the chilly side, and it doesn't change temperature : []
basically everything was excellent! If you have a problem, they fix it! Fantastic! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We loved jogging along here and up around the park : []
Had to change room on the very first day to another suite due to large black ants crawling over the walls, floors and ceiling : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
There are also so many rooms that one could feel lost in the hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
but in terms of choice, you don't have the variety IMHO : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pool in the fitness area is amazing and allows excellent relaxation : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
The rooms are already renovated, so it's a mixture between modern and traditional : []
I travelled with my husband : []
Breakfast is more common : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The room was spacious and clean, which was nice after 29 hour travel! : [u'amenities', u'conference']
we received warm welcome at reception and room was also decorated for the special occasion : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I still think it is removed but not so much as we thought, we loved our short time here and would definitely spend 2 or 3 nights here at the end of a Bali holiday to just relax : []
If you like the hustle and bustle of Kuta this resort and location is not for you : [u'amenities', u'pool']
It was very peaceful there and very quiet : []
This place is 30 years old but in a very good nik, however some modernisation of the rooms and common areas is required for it to compete with the likes of Westin and Lagoona and other new properties coming up on Nusa Dua Beach : [u'room', u'furniture']
We had a very long flight to Bali with 24 hours of travelling but on arrival, the beautiful hotel and resort and the staff soon erased the memory : []
The staff were excellent and enjoyed my smattering of Indonesian when ordering and greeting : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The choice of fresh food options at all the restaurants at this hotel is second to none : []
All in all a wonderful relaxing and thoroughly enjoyable hotel with all the facilities and amenities you need and all very well appointed : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Bubble baths and steam baths are also conveniently located in the spa's dressing room : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I thought I was paying the resort for a service - someone should remind him of that small fact : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It is walking distance to the Bali convention center and it has beautiful white sand beach : []
Previous visit was 30 years ago! Hotel has been beautifully maintained in intervening years, when staff realised it was my birthday they provided a cake and fruit to our room : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
- Kuta is a busy place with load of cheap hotels and as I think it is not a completelly safe area, we prefer Nuas Dua area ( but for younger people may be kuta has some attractions like nightclubs, bars, : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
My only reservation would be the price of eating and drinking there all day every day, so I would recommend going out into the town- there are just as many lovely places to go there, and you can save your money for some scuba diving or sightseeing to the volcano, which can all be arranged through the hotel and are definitely worth making the effort to leave the gorgeous hotel surroundings for! : [u'amenities', u'conference']
At our 2nd check in we waited more than one hour for our room : []
However, it's important to be aware of the fact that the prices for beverages and food as well as for the services (watersports, massages, organised trips) are just ridiculous and where actually insulting, having travelled around most of Bali and Java for 2 weeks before arriving at the hotel : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Rooms were large and well serviced, the kids loved the beach and the parents the spa pool : [u'overall', u'culture']
Most of the people we came across spoke some English, but misunderstandings were very easy : [u'room-experience', u'view']
To address some other reviewers comments, yes, Nusa Dua is a purpose built resort enclave that doesn't really give you a taste of the real Bali (although a walk through Tanjung Benoa or Bualu village will help in this respect) : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
I had my bestest holiday getaway with Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : []
which they did : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I have stayed in this resort a few times in the past and have always loved the experience : []
In fact we didn't ever need an evening meal as we were always so full : []
Rooms particularly are showing old age wear, the towels and linen are old and no longer looking white, bathroom fittings stained and not working well and the standard of room cleaning is not wonderful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
We have just returned from our stay with you, we enjoyed every minute, it was excellent, the staff were wonderful, always so very happy ,giving you that wonderful magical Bail holiday feeling : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The time you enter, you are entertained with wet damp scented towels, gives you so much rejuvenated : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The Staff are extremely courteous, genuinely friendly and professional : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The extras which are provided in the Palace Club are worth considering when booking : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The standards here are really high and the attention to detail is what lifts it above other resorts we have visited : []
At breakfast they remembered our names and preferred coffee : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We travelled with our two sons 9 and 7 : []
First time in Bali and weren't sure what to expect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
1 hour is actually enough : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The rooms are lovely designed and generally I would describe it as a very pretty resort, worth every penny! We felt incredibly lucky to book in last minute travel for a very attractive price! We intend to come back!! : []
My family and I ( with 2 kids , aged 11 & 12 ) have just returned from a 6-day stay in early June at this wonderful hotel : [u'overall', u'culture']
Staff were realy friendly and nothing was to much trouble for them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed at this hotel for 5 very relaxing days : []
Ordered their famous Crispy Duck set dinner and it was not a wrong choice made : []
If I had to nitpick I would say the room was a bit tired and the heavy wardrobe doors would slide back and nearly take your fingers off but overall a lovely hotel in a beautiful area with a nice beach and wonderful staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
com they charge much cheaper than the hotel rates : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Tea time at noon was a joy with drinks and some small bites : [u'location', u'sea']
we had a lovely stay, thank you : []
The pasta was great but infortunally the local foods like nasi goreng was so so : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Can't recommend this enough : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our day consisted of feasting on the great breakfast, down to a deck chair at the beach for the wonderful views and a swim at high tide, lunch on the beach or beside the pool, then back to a deck chair at the pool for happy hour (which goes for three hours) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
* there is another pool called the lagoon that did not seem very clean : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were upgraded to a palace room this time and were made to feel like royalty : []
All staff were very friendly and polite : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
This is our second stay at this resort and again we have been given a wonderful experience : []
Rooms are large, clean, well thought out, with all the usual amenities of a 5 star resort : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The beach is not so great, we are beach lovers, with sea grasses you have to walk through to get to clearer waters : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The choice of food at breakfast was good and staff were pleasant : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
For us Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is our safe and pleasant home away from home : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
3) Room was quite run down (at that time) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
There are plenty more on the beach however : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
When we looked more closely around the room the following morning we noticed that the furniture was so marked and dirty that I would hesitate to sit on it : []
We had a massive Jacuzzi bathtub which beside it there was louvered doors which could be opened into the bedroom : [u'amenities', u'conference']
This hotel had it all : []
It is located at the edge of the ocean - far from the hustle and bustle of the city centre : []
I thought i knew what friendly staff was, but theese guys take it to the next level : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This gives you an upgraded room, complimentary breakfast in your own private area, afternoon tea is free, as are cocktails between 6 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
we were greeted by all staff where ever we walked or were served by : []
We were bringing a baby, so you can imagine how much stuff we had in the room : []
My friend paid so the kid got a full adult menu : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I thnik this gives the hotel a different and unique atmosphere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Whatever these holidays were just unforgettable, people is lovely, landscapes are majestic, weather is perfect, food is incredible : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The bathroom can be seen from the bedroom if required by sliding open beautiful wooden doors and you can then watch the tv whilst relaxing in the foam bubbling bath!!! The bedroom is huge, and the bed enormous : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
Every aspect of the resort was fantastic : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Breakfast at the hotel as great (included) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Stayed 6 nights end August 2013 : [u'location', u'sea']
Very happy I did not stay there as it seems the Westin is the host to all of the business conventions and is always loud and busy verses the surrounding hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It costs about 80,000 to get to Kuta Square area and about 100,000 if you are coming back from Legian area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only disadvantages are still the same: cannot swim at low tide; Nusa Dua is comparably badly located if you want to see the island; breakfast buffet very firmly sticks to melons, papayas, pinapples, apples, bananas, snake fruit (hope I have not forgotten anything), and wonderful mangos, rambutan, mangostan, guavas, and other more exotic fruit need to be purchased from the beach vendors : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Resort has everything to offer including masage at the day spa, you can relax by the beach or pool : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff were all very friendly, always smiling and greeting when you meet them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Thou service and communication at main front desk (reception) can be improved : [u'room', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'conference', u'elevator', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk', u'post-room', u'checkout']
The traders on the beach in front of the Hotel wear a numbered shirt so I think only licenced traders are allowed to deal there : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'bike-ride']
Really relaxing and very tropical : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
OK, this is a nice place, it has superb grounds, lovely pools and an impressive lobby : []
From the collection at the airport to the last handshake on departure every thing about Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is professional, friendly and enjoyable : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
Nusa Dua has way more character : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Prices to match : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
However, the hotel would provide everything you need, of course the charges is a bit high but you get high quality services also : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Absolutely loved staying at this hotel as the staff were friendly and helpful throughout : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The hotel wanted 650,000, I negotiated this to 425,000 : []
This is a great place to stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Our daughter was so in love with the room that we decided not to say anything about it : []
The resort is large, it has so many rooms and yet the pool was never crowded and we certainly were not rubbing shoulders with other guests : []
It is definitely worth paying the extra for Palace Club which covers full breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails and nibbles : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The rooms and staff were lovely and housekeeping came sometimes 4 times a day! The swimming pools were incredible - one of them is like a lagoon with sand in it and a volleyball net for some fun : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Children loves feeding the squirrels, running after ducklings, make sand castle : [u'amenities', u'garden']
My wife and I just returned from Bali where we stayed at the Nusa Dua Resort and Spa, we stayed in a Palace Club room which opened on to beautiful gardens and pond full of Koi : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We were given flowers in our room for both our wedding anniversary and a birthday : []
The beach was clean and welcoming : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
That is my only negative thing about the resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Buffet breakfast was the best and swimming pools were great! Only one thing, the service waiters around the pool areas could have been increased as sometimes it took a long time to flag one down, hotel would also make more money with more drinks sold so this should be a no brainier! Overall very happy and would return! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The ambience of the place met our expectations for our deluxe escape : [u'overall', u'spacious']
My Bali experience fell short of what I hoped, but I give this resort much credit for its overall positive contribution : []
i thought this was quite odd : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just returned from staying in a Palace Suite for 7 days : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Fine facilities and overall relaxed environment : [u'overall', u'culture']
I Gusti Made Sunada : []
In my opinion, many 5 star hotels got used to high charges but gradually forget about their differentiation and usually they do nothing different than an ordinary hotel which is not expected to offer you much : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Also on the kids club programe, if something is chargeable, it is marked chargeable : []
We were given a twin room by mistake : []
The food here was delicious and the prices were what we expected for an upscale, luxury beach resort : []
Would be nice to have some changes (especially the hot dishes) every few days : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The bed was so comfy and I really enjoyed my regular visit from the local squirrels : []
I have to commend the hotel for it's English speaking staff, very fluent and this made the stay so much more pleasant when you could communicate with staff, and they were interested in helping out with questions about Bali and where to go etc : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We wanted a relaxing holiday and that is what we got, a very enjoyable holiday with friends : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Weather was good, hot and sunny during the day with welcome breeze and occassional rain at night : [u'location', u'sea']
One of the greatests I had in my life : []
Comparing meals poolside in a 4/5 star hotel to meals in a dodgy shopping centre where there are pictures on the menu (Bali Collection) is pretty silly in my opinion : [u'room-experience', u'view']
thankyou once again for making our time there relaxing and memroble : [u'location', u'sea']
The hotel was beautiful and definitely did not disappoint : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed in a Palace Club room with all the xtras the club provides,including cocktails and finger food each evening : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Pls don't try the massage or spa at the hotel is terrible : [u'amenities', u'gym']
It is well worth a holiday : []
But very beautiful and peaceful :) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
No bath, which was a shame, but otherwise it was just what we needed : []
Nice resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel is absolutely fabulous : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Talking about security, I left my safe opened one day, and left the room : [u'overall', u'safety']
The kids club is the best deal in this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
English wasn't consistently good : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
I'll be honest, we were not over the moon with this hotel at first : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Don't get me wrong, it is still on a very fair and good level, but when claiming being on of the best, this critic is apropriate : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort grounds are beautiful but the exterior of the hotel buildings (not the reception area) are a bit tired : [u'room', u'furniture']
Room was a bit far from the lobby but it doesn't matter to us : []
Such a People Friendly Resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Inadequate loungers around the pools meant that we often had to find somewhere else to hang out : []
The spa is very good : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
You can do as much or as little as you desire in this 5+ star resort, and its sensational surroundings : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was our 3rd visit, with my wive in a wheelchair, and we loved every minute of it : []
They are not quick with service : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
But in reality the decor was great considering the wonderful Balinese architecture and gardens complemented the rooms : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The Hotel is BIG, but being in this wing gave you the feeling of being in a smaller hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The Balinese are very friendly and always seem happy and polite : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The reception area is spectacular, with a long bar behind it to one side, where it is cool & relaxing, & gives a view over the lagoon to the Dining area, reached by large stepping stones from the outside, or a lovely cool corridor from the inside : []
The hotel massages are clearly in a superior category : [u'amenities', u'gym']
80 for a 330ml can of coke from the lobby bar : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The hotel sent 2 gifts and a flower arrangement and an apology note which was very nice once it was all sorted : []
The room was lovely, bed was so comfortable, shower great and the air conditioning much welcomed after a week of travelling in the jungle in Sumatra! : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
The only let down at all these resorts are the toasters are so slow : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
All staff were wonderful and treated us as family : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Plenty activities, very good musik and musician : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Breakfast was fine but it was difficult to find ripe fruits : []
The service and effort by the staff is amongs the very best i have ever encountered, and we have stayed in many 5* resorts in Bali, Thailand and Malaysia : []
The butlers were very polite and discrete at the same time : [u'location', u'sea']
It has the largest beach of all hotels from Nusa Dua, beautiful gardens, pools, people are very nice and friendly, the food was great, rooms are very clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The entrance hall is enormous, cool and inviting, with views to the rear over the gardens : [u'amenities', u'garden']
I would hate to see them under pressure : []
Rooms and bathrooms are a bit 'tired' but clean : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Main positive: I found the architecture beautiful and there's a clinic on site : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
Same thing with the floor : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Look forward to going back : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The day spa is a MUST! I had the latte detox, and it was divine! The restaurants, bars, room service is all fantastic and plenty to choose from : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
limited opportunities for more-active leisure : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort is immaculately kept, the security guards ensure the environment feels safe, and the shopping centre is worth a visit too - the "labels" are amazing value : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We married in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel in June : []
Not particularly modern either, but with right room you can have a great view : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The resort is so beautiful! It is a pretty big place and we visited in low season (April) so there wasnt that many people there, i guess it would be a different experience if the resort was fully booked : [u'amenities', u'pool']
- As honeymooners I expected at least a tiny bit of fuss to be made of us - something to make us feel a little special : []
The food is top class and is kind of expensive compared to the rest of Bali but you are paying for quality : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
That night there were only 3 tables with customers and they could not get anything right : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
our highest expectations in all aspects : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The Nusa Dua beach area is the focal point of the resort : [u'location', u'general']
If you can drag yourself away from this hotel, there is a path from the hotel before the beach that runs for about 2 miles one away and 2 miles the other, leading to other hotels along the sea front : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Large breakfast buffet is great : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Given that this is in nusa dua, the drinks and food are overpriced as is the norm in all hotels, however i didnt feel i was being ripped off so much as when i stayed in other nusa dua hotels : []
Access to Palace Club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
The hotel is situated fairly close to Bali Collection so that if you need any souvenirs or just want to grab some dinner, it's convenient : []
The presentation from the moment you enter the grand and peaceful foyer is stunning and will set the pace of your stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was near to impossible to change as the 3rd day is a Saturday and the spa booking was full : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
All good otherwise : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
There was an egg station for omlettes and fried eggs and then buffet fried bacon, ham, sausages, hash browns, grilled tomato together with an Asian style breakfast selection, pastries, toast, fruit and salad : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Service and friendliness of the staff is outstanding : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The only complaint I have is that as mentioned in many other reviews our room was extremely damp : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
If you want absolute 5* luxury it would be better to get one of the Palace Club rooms or suites : []
Children had a ball! We enjoyed the whole resort : [u'overall', u'culture']
The Nusa Dua has just completed a renovation which I thought was done well : []
An unforgettable holiday and we will always recommend this resort! : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
If you come to Bali I would strongly suggest you see some of the local culture and temples which this island is famous for : [u'location', u'sea']
I'm calling the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel the most authentically Balinese, just because the resort itself and the rooms all have a lot of characteristic touches : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
Plenty of activities available and a good choice of food provided by multiple restaurants within the resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Kind and caring, always want to please their guests to make your holiday memorable : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
It was our 3rd stay in the hotel : []
beautifull place clean room best service best pool and beautifull beach : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Whenever we needed something (free modem hookup - need to buy internet card first, though) they were quick to come up and help : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The theme nights and Balinese dancing was fantastic, lovely breakfast every morning enjoyed by the exquisite water gardens were mind blowing : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
While the hotel is starting to show it's age in some respects it was still a fantastic experience and we would highly recommend this resort : []
Service was a little slow at times, but it's not too bad when you are lying around the pool relaxing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This was our second visit with our young children and we will return again next year : [u'overall', u'culture']
All of them nice and no complaints about : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Best of all, guests have free access to the spa 'lap' pool, which is enormous : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Nusa Dua its quiet area ideal for relaxing and walking around their beautiful gardens and beach : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The breakfast is simply awesome : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
as you come into the property, the candi bentar (split gates) together with the Balinese architecture make this feel a little more in touch with its location than the other resorts along Nusa Dua : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
No diving, no noise, no children under 12 and no alcohol is served there : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling']
so the balcony furniture and surrounds needed at the very least a good clean with a high pressure hose : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'conference']
They had a very good stock of DVDs, which we made some use of : []
We came again this year with extended family for 12 days and all, young and old, had a wonderful holiday and talk of yet again coming back : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Breakfast was incredible each morning !! Great location close to the beach : []
Oh and I have to mention the bath/shower unit : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed for 12 nights with two family groups which included 5 adults and 3 children ranging from 9 to 3 years : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Our son had their wedding at the Resort which was beautifully organised : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The staff can't do enough for you : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We had an excellent stay at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa in august 2009 : []
Our only gripe with the room was the vast cabinet used to house the CRT TV set : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The absence of a menu board may deter people from dining due to a perception that it is exclusive and expensive : []
This was my second visit within 9 months and it was fabulous : []
We booked and requested a non smoking poolside room : []
Beside this experience the hotel is really more than average and we enjoyed our stay very much : [u'location', u'sea']
Recently returned from a 10-day stay at this beautiful hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Beware of the guys at the shopping centre touting and saying you've won a competition to lure you into going to their premises (with free taxi) on another day, it's a complete waste of time and only for rich people who want to subscribe to an annual resort holiday - not a fault of the hotel at all, but to be careful of in Bali! : [u'amenities', u'patio']
12noon - 1pm is lunch time : []
Bali Collection has an hourly shuttle bus where you can pick up some groceries, shop at Sogo (Japanese Department store) there is also a chemist, bookshop and lots of restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The conciege was very helpful and efficient in organising additional golf game at the New Bali Golf club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
In fact, its probably one of the best thing this trip, thus for what is worth, I am glad I stayed in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa : []
The last option will be laying down on the beach there : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Beach was beautiful, but ocean was not so good due to excess seaweed : [u'location', u'sea']
Their salmon gravlax was impressive too : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed in the paradise club which I would recommend if you can, as you get a free brekfast, afternoon tea and cocktails in the evening in a quiet out of the way reeoption room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
As repeat guests of the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel (10 visits since 2002, together with our best friend couple) we would like to recommend Palace Wing accomodation especially because of an outstandig qualitiy of service by all staff members under the leadership of Mr I Gusti Made Sunada : []
also at beach area : [u'location', u'general']
It has a number of pools including a kids pool & the main pool with a fabulous swim-up bar : []
The pools are beautiful and the view gorgeous : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Hard to fault this place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
All the restaurants served varied food : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The included breakfast was really good : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Good conference / function room facilities : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

Staff amazing Environment perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed for a wonderful 12 nights and loved every minute of our holiday : []
Only a short stroll to local restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The people working there were friendly and couldn't do enough to help : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However I would highly recommend booking some tours through the resort : []
It's in dire need of renovation, after which it may be a candidate : []
We moved to the Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa after a terrible experience at the Aston Bali : []
Every time we showered, water would flow onto the side and onto the floor : [u'amenities', u'pool']
There was really no need to leave the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Nusa Dua does not allow many sales people on their private beach & sellers do pay a premium to have the chance to seel to guests, this means they do not haggle as hard as they pay to be there also : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I had arranged cakes, celebrations etc : []
Evening cocktails was very good but a bit of trap as after a few canapes we generally didn't go and have a meal : []
Near to the beach, nice dinner on sand by The Chess , quiet surrounding and friendly staffs : [u'amenities', u'gym']
if you have chosen or are thinking about this place for your honeymoon as we did you will not be disapionted : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Great for families : [u'overall', u'culture']
Our last trip was in July 2014 and we focussed on SANUR 3-4 star hotels : []
Food generally good, particularly breakfast : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The welcome was fantastic : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I must admit my husband was very hesitant to travel to Bali; once he arrived at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort his idea of Bali changed : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The room was basic but clean and for some reason a huge telly : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
TV is large and has great selection of international channels : []
We defineletly recomend it for families : []
The staff at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa are outstanding and took such good care of us : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
One disappointment for me was the noises out of the door could easily hear from inside the room, the problem came when someone passing by your doorstep at the early morning which could really wake you up, especially staffs pushing trolley passing your doorstep : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The Palace Club was amazing, beautiful set up and excellent service : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
My grand daughter also enjoy Gecko Kid Club very much,she was very exiting when practice how to wear complete Balinese Cloth guided by very professional and friendly Club attendant : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
Large, well laid out and tastefully designed and furnished with parquet flooring, carved timber screens and a relaxing neutral colour scheme : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We stayed in the Palace Club room on the ground floor : []
On every other day we felt almost like we were the only one's there, which was nice : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The room was huge : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Beach is great and lap pool fantastic : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The food was quoite good and even though a bit expensive, its worth the extra spending on the honeymon : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We travelled at the end of July with two young children and it was our son's 8th birthday whilst we were there and the staff made a big effort for him, beautiful cake, flowers and balloons : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The breakfast is top! The spa is fantastic! Just try it out, it gives you the feeling to be in heaven! And close to the airport : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The Happy Hour is sensational : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Stay here during March for 4 nights We stay in premier room which we really enjoyed with a lovely view of lake with fountian and ducks swimming : []
Well maintained and managed resort with local architectural features and landscaping in very relaxing surroundings : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
They insist putting only 2 bottles of water to the room which is obviously not enough in that whether, so we had to call every time we need water to get refilled 2 bottles again : []
In fact, the dinner meals and shows are all a pretty good deal : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Apparently the fast track stopped weeks ago : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Also, the entertainment evenings in the Buddaya theatre on site were really good, with superb buffets set up, and beautifully decorated surroundings : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
A flatscreen tv on the wall with 60 differents channels : []
Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is old if you compare to another hotel in Nusa Dua but its still look excellent : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Thankyou so very much : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On our first night we ate at the Chess Club for my sons 16th birthday and I had prearranged a cake with the hotel from back home which they brought out after dinner with a three piece band and all the waiters singing Happy Birthday though he was embarrassed he loved it : []
Staff: We have to say, the staff were fantastic : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
We do still have 3 more days here so hopefully things take a turn for the better : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had been to Bali many times : []
We had dinner at Chess Restaurant and the pizza bar by the pool, people below have mentioned they felt it cost too much, well if you come from Australia, the meals are very affordable in my eyes, even the mini bar is well priced IMO compared to Australia, so we got stuck right in : []
Bali is changing , a new airport is being built and more western hotels appear each time you visit : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They are very instructive and helpful and there is a great wreck towads the north of the island which is definatley worth a visit : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It doesnt always connect you),very nice balinese style Paintings/carvings in the room : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
just an overnight stay for me and my son was enough to tell myself that i should've booked for at least 2 more nights : []
Facilities were very clean : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Overall very positive stay and I could easilly reccomend it to anyone : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Still this hotel was very good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
it was then black : []
some more indian menu should be added for the main course, : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Make sure you book in advance, no later than the morning that you need : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel and our room was very clean, we were happy with our accommodations : []
The hotel is in a secluded gated 'community' with several other 5 star hotels (the Westin is right next door) and if we wanted to explore anywhere outside the hotel, we had to take a cab : []
My absolute favourite was the complimentary afternoon tea served in the Palace Lounge! This is our new favourite hotel and cant wait to return : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'patio']
We had an amazing holiday, thank you so much : []
Stayed here many times when the hotel was new : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed at this hotel on 12 January 2008 : []
We'd been to Bali before but wanted to stay somewhere quieter than Kuta/Legian so thought we would try Nusa Dua : []
I was disappointed arriving late with children and not been given an appropriate family room as ordered : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Did a lot of research on tripadvisor, and we were so happy with our choice : []
It offers pure authentic Bali atmosphere and ambiance with a modern touch, they seem perfectly manage n maintain the whole hotel years after years and gives a top-notch stay experience n services : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Thank you to the great team of Nusa Dua Beach Resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
They are excellent and willing to help and they are a wonderful lot : [u'amenities', u'recreation']

The peace was especially important to us given that our 2 childen went to bed quite early in the evening : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We loved the location and friendly staff : []
One needs to take a taxi ride (about 12 bucks or so) to get to the other areas like Kuta or Seminyak : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Upon our return, the hotel nurse saw my wife immediately and then called for a doctor, who arrived within the hour : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Also has a nicer beach front location than the neighbouring resorts like Laguna and Melia : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
I will miss seeing this view every morning! : []
Would definitely recommend this hotel and we hope to return next year : []
The hotel has great character and is not what you would call truly modern but that added to the charm of the place : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
These restaurants collect you and drop you home : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Apart from this was a great resort we enjoyed every minute of our stay : []
It was the first resort built in the area and it is still provides the same quality of service and entertainment for guests : []
- No complimentary breakfast : [u'services', u'in-room', u'housekeeping']
Could not fault anything with the hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Try this place for a vacation to keep : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
Everything was included and there were only a few restrictions : []
We went for our honeymoon and stayed here for 4 nights : []
Just returned from another stay at NDBH, and I never get tired of it : []
We like the tress there, lots of trees, very natural and stress free : []
Haven't quite decided after my second trip to Bali whether the drivers are really skillful or on a suicide mission : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
A soundproof nursery on site would have been greatly appreciated : [u'amenities', u'garden']
I asked a colleague in Jakarta to recommend a hotel and he suggested Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa and we loved the place : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Absolutely Loved the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']

Its lovely to have direct access to the gardens from your bedroom especially to go for your morning stroll prior to breakfast and to enjoy the view of the garden whilst having coffee on the patio : [u'amenities', u'patio']
If your are thinking to go to Bali , take this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Visit the Spa and try the Balinese massage for relief from a long airplane trip : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
We will be back soon : []
you'll be pampered beyond belief : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The palace club serves great breakfasts, but the food seems to go downhill as the day goes on : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The evening cocktails were a great experience with the chance to meet other guests : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
It was our second stay at this hotel and we can't wait to go back again : []
Onesearckenzan thing is the kids club really needs improving : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
if possible, we come back again very soon : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On arrival we were thrilled with our accom selection : []
The food in the hotel is good, and not unreasonably priced compared to Uk : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
A bit of advice about the pool loungers being scarce : [u'amenities', u'patio']
,you can do long walks : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The beach isn't that great in my opinion - no shade and not that nice, but I realise coming from Queensland we are spoilt with some of the best beaches in the world : []
The only problem I had with this hotel was when we checked in to this hotel the reception staff checked you in and that was it no one explained the layout of the hotel or directed you to the breakfast area : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
We did'nt dine in the hotel with the exception of breakfast but there are some nice places to eat at Bali Connections just up the road : [u'location', u'general']
Even snorkles etc have to be hired too : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Food was the best part of the stay : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Location and facilities were great with something for everyone : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
They sat me, a young family and others at their bar ( No utensils or place mat) and then turned it into the smoking den for a tour group of Russians When I moved the ash trays away from where I was eating they moved them back : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Use of the Club Lounge facilities for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails was very much enjoyed : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
From the moment our cab get close to the hotel we both siad o h my god : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Although people in Bali call Dreamland another place, still this hotel qualifies for dreamland description : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We met the whole management team as well who were very friendly : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The rooms are " Balinese" in decor : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
The pizza I ordered was tasty although devoid of the promised fresh basil and oregano but the starter of eggplant parmigiana that arrived for 75,000 rupiah defied belief : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Expect high prices : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
They do very fast service : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Would have been nice if the hotel had a "happy hour", but then it was only a 3 minute walk to the Laguna where they have a daily 6-8pm 50% off all drinks! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I still have 8 days more to stay : []
The check out lounge providing air-con waiting area, showers + lockers for those that want to make the most of their day after checking out of rooms before leaving : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
you were left 2 glass bottles of water in your room,if you wanted more you then had to buy some,you had the choice of the mini bar drinks and snacks : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It shouldn't just meet the expectations but exceed it : []
the "village" of nusa dua is a 5 min walk away and you can eat better valued food there if you prefer : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Beach Resort and had an amazing time : [u'location', u'sea']
Check in process done so fast & take us to our room : []
But after noted, we do not transfer to the table, not offered a drink, even dining table is not ready for use : [u'room', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'conference']
The staff were all very friendly and professional : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The facilities were great and we enjoyed tennis, squash and the water activities : []
Can rent clubs as well : []
We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the resort and would recommend it : []
Nice surrounding,free wifi,comfy coach : [u'overall', u'spacious']
The room was large and pretty posh, with lots of woodwork and sliding plantation shutters inside the sliding glass/wood doors to the outside : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Hotel accommodation was great with food & beverage variety & price being well over our expectations when compared to some other resorts we have stayed at : []
Our family stayed in garden rooms on the ground floor which were much more appealing and spacious : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Very busy at the hotel this time as a lot of people took up the Luxury escape package so it had more families in the club than usual but this was not a problem : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
So, if you want to shopping outside and look around Bali, it may not be good place to choose to stay : []
Our room was so very far away from the pool which was a shame : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Breakfast, although had a wide variety, was pretty much they same fare everyday so you started to get bored of it after a while : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Kayumanis spa and private villas are truly a hidden jewel in bali : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Of course, we can eat outside the Nusa Dua area for less but for an international hotel it is not overpriced : []
We have stayed at resorts on several occasions now and this one is up with best of them : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The rooms were really lovely, clean and very large with great bathrooms, we had a Jacuzzi bath and a double shower in ours, and the whole room had everything you could need, the laundry service was fine (nothing shrunk or lost!) and there was a huge TV/stereo/DVD player if you just felt like staying out of the sun for a lie-in : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Just paradise if wanting rest, relaxation and pampering : [u'amenities', u'patio']
The staff in particular were just so friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Water was crystal clear and if you look closely, there were countless tiny fishes all around : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Poor currency exchange rate at hotel much better at Bali Collection : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The restaurant food was very good, the situation is excellent, beds and pillows great : [u'room-experience', u'view']
We chose the Resort to celebrate our 50th W/Anniversary,it exceeded : []
Waited 1 hour and I had to ask myself again and found the room was ready for some time : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
It is very romantic : []
My sister and I had a very relaxing stay here while we toured around Bali with our private guide : []
This hotel is absolutely lovely and lived up to every expectation and more : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
No weather channel on TV,I do not go on vacation to watch TV but I do like a weather channel to check the weather while I am there : []
The sea has weeds floating at the shore though the hotel staff keep cleaning the beach : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Fresh juice, fresh fruit, salads and a wide range of cheeses was also on offer : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
This is nice as there is always a good selection of food and the cocktails are very good : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
We had a Palace Suite, and all the extras that went with that luxury accommodation - afternoon tea, cocktails, free meals and massages - well worth the upgrade : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You can get wifi in a One Star bungalow in the middle of the island : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pool was way too warm but water activities were awesome : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed in a room at the Spa wing and it was a huge room for the 3 of us : []
Had premier room on previous stays, still dont know why I booked the other : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Pool was huge and beach is amazing warm sea and very calm waters : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Evening cocktails are very generous so be warned : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
Excellent facilities, Free WiFi around lobby area : [u'location', u'general']
We spent a lot of time lazing on the loungers and were constantly entertained by the antics of the mischievous squirrels playing in the trees nearby : []
The beach is very nice and clean, you can even have lunch or dinner at the beach when you want : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The only thing which disappointed us was the full body spa, wasnt anything to what I had expected : []
There is a shopping center which houses some very nice shops but not really the balinese experience, this is of course as it is aimed at the top end clientele which is also fine, we had fish pedicures here & used the shopping centre to buy water & beer & snacks for our room & for our day trips : []
The staff really friendly : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The entrance to the hotel is stunning at night : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Had a wonderful experience here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed at Nusa Dua Beach hotel for 4 nights at the end of a two week Bali holiday, and had connecting rooms : []
The location is perfect : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
We attended a wedding in July 2013 : []
very nauseating : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall, this hotel is beautiful and clean and more Balinese, but not luxurious or modern : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The setting and cleanliness of this property is a credit to all the staff and ground keepers : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Though as we normally do we decided to eat at Hotel some evenings and found the food at the Chess beachfront dissapointing, I am only being honest in saying this the seafood platter lacking to say the least : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
What a great hotel! The staff were excellent and the room beautiful! I really recommend the in house restaurant! fantastic local baliense food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The first thing I noticed about this hotel was the how magnificent the building was, the hotel and facilties are extremely modern, yet the foyer has a huge magnificent balinese roof and there a multiple old pagodas used to enhance the building : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Free bottled water was given every day and if I drank that before the housekeeper came to do turn down service, the water was replenished : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The food was average, terrible table seated as far as we could go asked for a finger bowl twice and also asked for crackers to open the crab and that never came so could not enjoy my crab : []
We had breakfast in both the club lounge and the restaurant and unfortunately was the same every day so it did get a bit boring after a few days : []
Get there early : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We always stay at the Palace Club and each time our greeting upon arrival almost reduces me to tears the same beautiful staff (and some new ones) are there to welcome us with open arms : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
so tranquil : []
Almost uncooked pastry at the bottom and all the toppings are too wet : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
A wonderfully restful hotel complex; which provided plenty of on site leisure and dining options : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The check-in process took a very long time although there weren't many people waiting to be served when we arrived : []
The cocktails and other drinks are delicious however and we also enjoyed the breakfasts in that area : []
2) The Spa is honestly really good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel has 300+ rooms so this means that the pool will get quite crowded and it can be a problem trying to find a sunbed, you will get the obligatory towel reserving which is a pet hate of mine, however I had no qualms in removing towels that had been there for 30mins+ without an occupier anywhere to be seen and pinching it for myself ;-D : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
There's plenty of places outside to eat for 1/3rd the cost of the hotel, and just as good : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The bed was large : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'linens', u'furniture']
The conference centre was an eight minute walk : [u'amenities', u'gym']
Indulge in true balinese luxury and pure extravagance here : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Luckily, during my stay they were about to release turtles to the sea : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The good thing with the beach is it's connected to the adjacent hotels through a jogging track along the beach, a very nice way to enjoy your morning/afternoon walk : []
We were shown to our room : []
The tropical fruits sourced locally are amazing : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The restaurants were lovely with plenty of food options available on site : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The hotel is involved with turtle conservation and the guests can get involved : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Me and my family had a great time in this hotel : []
ok once inside the room but walking in the corridor you had to cover your face : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
More expensive than local cars but the drivers are careful and know what they are doing and the cars are well maintined : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I was 'kicked' around different personnel before I got to the front desk manager and got it solved : []
Pool towel were tatty & grotty & dobt smell fresh : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
Would I stay here again?? Um, probably yes but only if I was guaranteed a room that was cleaned and maintained to the standard it should be : []
Very unpleasant for them and not dealt with effectively to any satisfaction or compensation by management : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There is live music three nights a week which is nice and romantic : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Our room and balcony needed an up fresh; there were stains on the wall and the furniture and the floor were worn out : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'amenities', u'elevator']
Aside from that one disappointment, I enjoyed every minute of my stay here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We went to the indonesian dance show where we listened to wonderful music and watched some great dancing : []
Anyway, it didnt spoil the experience for us, but its something for the hotel to fix : []
Great views, and spacious area : [u'overall', u'spacious']
Highly recommend : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We have just back from this piece of paradise and we are already missing it : []
We had a very restful time at the resort, it has the most beautiful grounds : []
You could say the experience is different every time : [u'overall', u'feel']
i would highly recommend it for everyone : []
Many thanks to the complete hotelstaff : []
As a business man can understand the change : [u'overall', u'culture']
The variety and quality was excellent and the quantity up to the individual : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Absolutely fantastic to be able to go to the club at any time and have a fresh squeezed fruit juice : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Only cause for comment was the Cocktail hour for Palace Club guests, perhaps the hotel should consider making the hour an Adults only time as quiet cocktails turned into a visit to the local pre-school : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'drinks']
Rooms were well serviced and comfortable : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
I asked hotel why I had to change my booking room and why the hotel did not explain earlier, but no answer : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Service and selection at all of the restaurants was superb and the breakfast selection is one of the best I have ever experienced : []
The room we had was the perfect size and had everything we needed : []
There wasn't much going on for activities, so if your looking for quiet and calm this your spot : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
our room was located at one of the best location, the pool was the best ive ever seen,the beach is nice and quite, big property, breakfast was just amazing, lot of option in all the cuisines, : [u'room', u'furniture']
But the Nusa dua beach hotel has been kept well maintained and i found it to be the best in terms of landscaping, size of the hotel (big lawns etc) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Budi the assistant manager at the Palace Club is a helpful and friendly man if you run into any problems : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We can recommend a trip to Jimbaran, get some seafood while watching the sun go down : [u'location', u'sea']
The NDBH is a pretty good hotel : []
We are already planning our return : []
A beautiful Balinese style hotel with great beach and pool area, numerous options for dining and delicious breakfasts : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
In this area of Nusa Dua the beach path is well maintained and its nice walking along checking out the other beach front hotels : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We have been a reular travellers all our lives and always stay in 5 Star hotels : []
Some comments on how the rooms are old and need updating were unfounded : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff is what makes this place what it is, genuine, kind, helpful and always happy! Its our home away from home and we are already planning our next trip back! We can't reccommend this hotel enough, its the best of the best! If we could give it a rating of 100 we would! : []
Upon complaining, however we were moved to a much quieter and bigger room : []
Breakfast was colorful, wide (Chinese, Japanese, English, continental, local, lots of fresh exotic and local fruits, bread with crusts : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Comfortable and plenty of facilities : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
For families I imagine this hotel would be great they have so many activities to do from swimming in the 2 pools, pool volleyball, fruit carving lessons, table tennis, darts, gym, squash, lap pool, tennis, beach volleyball, 2 hotel pools, cycling, beach, day trips to the shops, hairdresser, spa and 4 or 5 restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
After a few more minutes without us budging they offered RP600,000 : []
We had massages and spa's in the most gorgeous setting with lovely staff pampering us!! The staff were very polite and friendly, we will definitely come back here : []
,the bath tub that drained so slow,when we was there the money exchange rate was : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub']
Had a large selection of foods and with a beautiful view of the beach : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
We have just returned from 9 nights at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and could not recommend it highly enough : []
We used the spa a number of times both as part of our voucher and without : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
Rooms are large and very comfortable, beds are fantastic and pillows so comfy : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains']
The lagoon is fine to swim but I doubt snorkeling will be fruitful : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling']
Other than that, the staff and the service were great : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Two large pools, plenty of lounge chairs, no issue with towels : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens', u'bathrobe', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
Urs Klee General Manager very polite & friendly also the Food & Beveridge manager Sinead : [u'amenities', u'conference']
was just great : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And definitely would recommend anyone to stay here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However that said, it wasn't any better here than at any hotel along this strip of beach : []
The other two pool situated near the beach are lovely and opened 7:00am - 8:00pm : []
Which is a shame because the hotel is great : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Mostly only the basic international fare : [u'location', u'general']
The Nusa Dua beach is also just nearby, sharing with the other neighbouring 5* hotels : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The staff were all terrific although it took around 3 days for someone to find me a good pillow : []
From breakfast where traditional Balinese music is audible from somewhere nearby played as you eat- to the lounge bar area where the staff fast became friends : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The staff takes care of your luggage, so you get the care-free feeling right away : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The pools are good , great towels and shade is easy to find : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens', u'bathrobe', u'services', u'in-room', u'laundry']
We ate at a variety of the restaurants and the food was always good : []
More room then we needed as we were always out by the pool : []
Would definately recommend for other visitors and I will be looking to return myself : []
We recently stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa for our honeymoon in Bali : []
This is an AMAZING and INCREDIABLE hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
And yet the tastes is so GREAT too! Yet, nothing to talk much about this part : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Not a place to stay if you are on holiday, nusa dua is extremely touristy : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
I read some people say that Nusa Dua had a white sandy beach - its hardly white, more like light golden brown, but its pleasant enough : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
It was without a doubt THE BEST Tiramisu I have had ANYWHERE in the world : []
The club and all activities were free : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
However, the setting and gardens looked great and the Palace Club offers nice drinks and snacks : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
We really enjoyed our 8 night stay here with our two young children : [u'overall', u'culture']
Small details but the details do add up! We stayed in a standard room and found especially the bathroom to be very dated with a shower head propped over a bath and a nylon shower curtain : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
The Pavillion is fairly new and food and service were excellent and cheap, especially local dishes : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Overall my trip was good : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, compared to local restaurants it is very expensive in the hotel, about 30% more : []
What a fantastic experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
They decorated the bed, the bathroom etc : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
They knew it was my husbands birthday and went the extra mile with an amazing flower display in room plus a choc birthday cake : []
After reading reviews, this seemed like the place to stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Hotel location is ideal away from hustle : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
But that did not last long, as this Hotel is 5 star, and has everything you need for a beautiful stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The staff are wonderful and very attentive especially Anita in the breakfast area : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Bang, bang, boom, boom, crash from 6 or 630 in the morning : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
An incident worth mentioning here would be of an evening after dinner at one of the eating Joints at Bali Collection we were caught up in a heavy shower and as a result , missed the last bus back to the Hotel : [u'location', u'airport', u'station']
Our time in Bali left a lasting impression on my mother-in-law that during a return trip to New Zealand this year we decided to revisit Bali as a surprise for her : []
When we first arrived, the place looked amazing, very big and quite majestic : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Price is reasonable : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Easy access to Bali Collection but importantly can get to other main tourist areas and airport simply via the new bridge system : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'checkin']
The cost of everything in the hotel is exceptionally high compared to the small restaurants just outside the hotel grounds and to be honest their service and food standards were much higher and friendlier : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Go for it!! : []
staff all fantastic : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Now the areas where we were disappointed: : []
Will definitely come back soon : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We're from the U : []
As the shower head is in the ceiling of the shower, you have no choice but to wet your hair during every shower : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But you Nusa Dua Hotel, you impressed me well : []
quiet, breezy, private and has a long stretch of spa massages for you to choose and drinks (at night) : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
The beach is just amazing (calm and serene) They have many sunbeds etc that you can relax on : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Darren the executive chef runs a great kitchen : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Although it rendered us a great view and nature ambience, it stole some of out privacy : []
Great food, close by shopping and dining at Bali Collection via stuttle bus on the hour : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The staff there all speak English perfectly and there is entertainment most evenings : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Yes , most definitely would stay again , but attention should be given to lifting the overall staff performance : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
I dont know why I didnt do this review 7years ago!!! : [u'amenities', u'internet']
The beach is great for a swim as well as the pool : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Tennis courts are a bonus and we loved having use of them : []
My last stay was during the21st International Seaweed Symposium as this is the most convenient and closet hotel to the venue : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Like safe enviroment; really effective security;extremely clean beaches; away from the hustle and bustle of other areas of Bali : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
This was our second trip to the Nusa dua beach and we will definitely going back for a third : []
I would also recommend the indonesian restaurant, prices are western but you get high quality food and a nice dining experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This hotel is a beautiful oasis located on the Nusa Dua beachfront : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I'm very picky when it comes to room cleanliness; I need to be able to sleep comfortably in my room, on the bed, and shower comfortably : []
Plenty of space to store our clothes and room for our 2 large size suitcases : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
The resort has good sport club they also have squash court, try the court & play with the club coach was fantastic experience : [u'location', u'sea']
Restaurants: Maguro Asia Bistrot was excellent with Sashimi of superb quality : [u'overall', u'safety']
it's surreal to be in such a beautiful place, the resort, the people, the island : []
It could be faster, at less than 1 Mb speed it's at the border of acceptable : []
The staff never stop smiling : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stay here for 2 nights in deluxe room,very nice and clean hotel let you feel relaxing : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
got upgraded to a honeymoon suite : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
They have many, many shops and restaurants : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
One downside to the resort was the overpriced drinks and food at the resort restaurants : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The sea was clean and calm, most of the time spent on the beach : [u'location', u'sea']
Pity that the exchange rate was really high and I paid IDR300,000 for USD25 : []
We checked out the Laguna also in Nusa Dua and plan to stay there next as this looks like another level higher again : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Ate a few nights at Bali Collection which is a shopping area close by within walking distance or use the shuttle provided : [u'amenities', u'conference']
If you want busy, traffic and dirty streets stay in Kuta and good luck to you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
my first stay in Bali 30 years ago was at Nusa dua beach hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I enjoyed the more "international" clientelle, a welcome change from the Aussies we normally encounter in Kuta : []
By Rob & Laurel, May 21, 2015 : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
We cannot even begin to tell you how much we looked forward to the breakfast every morning! Such a variety and outstanding food! A tip would be to eat breakfast as late as you can manage to hold you over until dinner : []
Also its a full day trip form the resort : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
The swim up pool bar is refreshing & convenient for drinks : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Visited to once again celebrate my birthday : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Finally, what a wonderful housekeeper, Kastawar - dedicated to cleaning to the nth degree - never seen a housekeeper like him, scrupulous, trustworthy and so respectful : [u'overall', u'culture']
The staff in general were extremely friendly and nice but lacked basic comprehension if you wanted something : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Walking along the beach in the evening we noticed that some of the neighbouring hotels were livelier in terms of night life, but we actually preferred the Nusa Dua for being quiet : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The staff are SO lovely - they can not do enough for you and the little guy who works the pool bar is a sweetie - make sure you tip him at teh beginning of your stay and he will look after you with extra large drink through your stay : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Most exquisite food ever in a pool lounge environment (similar to Potato head) : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We were never in it except to sleep and change for dinner etc : []
We had lots of other surprises : []
This is one of the original and only remaining traditional Balinese style designed resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Staff are warm and friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
I believe that its ideal to take the palace club rooms for the privileges they offer : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
It is a lap pool with champak trees : []
It was not just the smell of damp that was the problem, the bed sheets were awfully damp and very cold and wet - not very pleasant at all! : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
like Westin Resort next door?? Your staff were excellent but please take 'movie time' off your list : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Need to put racks on the walls outside to hang our wet bathers : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
We have just returned from using an 8 day Luxury escape package at this hotel and thought it was an excellent package and venue : []
The pools were lovely and clean with beds and towels provided and a hop and skip away was the Chess Bar which sold snacks and grills, ideal for lunch : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel is big which makes it feel quiet : []
com), which gave us a wonderful tour tailored to our preferences at a competitive price : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Breakfast, however, was standard : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Standard rooms or Palace Club rooms (and 1 mansion if you have 10+ people and want your own pool) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We were then taken to a room past building work that was going on : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A large variety of food to choose from : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
Friendly, attentive staff, always smiling : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On the whole, much cheaper in Seminyak or other towns to eat, but no taxi ride to pay for, or 30 mins in traffic, so a good option at times : [u'location', u'sea']
Due to the bad weather we decided to leave early and as we paid our booking in full when we arrived, I asked to get the remaining 3 nights partly refunded : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
We asked what one Balinese Dish shoud we try, we were told the Duck special at Raja's : [u'amenities', u'pool']
All staff were courteous,friendly and aimed to please in all things : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
One night we sat at the Chess Bar and watched a waiter bring back a glass of Rose and a glass of Red that had obviously been incorrectly ordered, The Rose was poured back in to the bottle and the Red sat under the counter for around 60 mins and was then taken out to another patron witnessing this just about made my blood boil as it is very costly to purchase food and drinks here and you would hope that they were FRESH!! : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The food was good at the hotel (many cuisines to choose from) : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The beach has chairs & you can get table service for food & drinks where ever you are on the property : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Furniture is old, at the balcony always wet because of rain : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'furniture', u'overall', u'aesthetics', u'amenities', u'conference']
Having booked a whole extra day because we had a late night flight, we were told on arrival we would only need to pay for half a day as it was just a late check out : []
We did it once and then we opted to go to the buffet breakfast all the other times as it suited the family environment better : [u'overall', u'culture']
Love to stay again in this area and at this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
There's wired Internet service in the rooms, but unless you are really near the lobby or one of the restaurants out by the pool, don't expect to get wifi : [u'amenities', u'internet']
we will certainly stay here again : []
If you take a short walk you will find plenty of Blue Bird Taksi's which are cheap and the driver will take you anywhere you like and even arrange tours for a set price : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
You can take them anywhere or stay on the bike track which takes you around the beach : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Can't really find fault : []
We enjoyed the activities available to guests as well as the excellent spa services : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We stayed 10 nights with the Palace Club package : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The beach was nice and the resorts proximity to other hotels very handy : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Wife got sick during trip, cannot imagine more care what she received from Palace club staff, luckly with doctor's help she get weel within few days and we could spend lovely Easter and also have nice dinner at Raja's, quality and friendliness was again to top, but please change menu sometime, it would be pleasure for use how visit often : []
Great spot with excellent staff : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Rajah's restaurant (Indonesian) seemed very popular, always busy in the evening : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
My husband and I spent 3 nights in a palace club room at Nusa Dua Beach hotel a week ago : [u'overall', u'culture']
This worked well as at night time we could close the door and still watch TV , have a shower etc in our bedroom area : []
Definitely will come back with my family : [u'overall', u'culture']
The breakfast spread was unbelievable - it was hard to know when to stop eating! The pools were amazing and never overcrowded and all staff were very friendly and helpful : []
We did not use any other services : []
All this despite very low occupancy : [u'room', u'furniture']
Clean beach, good food : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Comparable to Similian Islands and Maldives : []
Many thanks to the wunderfull people at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa who made that we've had a great time again! Looking forward to come back next time : [u'location', u'sea']
We found the Nusa Dua Bch Hotel very nice, beautiful gardens, rooms were cleaned beautifully each day and service was excellent : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
My boy loves the pool, and not forget to mention the kid club is a really great place for kids : [u'overall', u'culture']
However, the hotel did not even compare to the more traditional hotels where I stayed, including Tandjung Sari in Sanur : []
However, I experience smelly toilet, I change rooms, and have same problem : []
Great deal : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
+ nice location : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Rooms were nice : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The other highlight for us was the morning, which we many times started in the long outdoor pool, next to the sauna world : []
There is free shuttle or local "taxi" for Rp35 : [u'location', u'airport', u'station', u'services', u'pre-room', u'pickup']
Great experience : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I could not have asked for more and I hope the photos I am including give you a flavor of the wonderful wedding day and honeymoon we enjoyed at this hotel : []
Finally, the spa at the hotel is excellent -- massages were amazing : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We ate at the italian restaurant : []
The most wonderful holiday will definitely be revisiting : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
However, it was short lived : []
Comfort room, helpful and friendly staff, clean and beautiful surrounding, great pools, evertything designed beautifuly and easy for us (me,my husband, and my 1 year baby) : []
This is my personal perception and experience and may easily differ from others : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Room was top notch : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
During european summer the day is short in Bali, 6 pm is already dark, but is definitelly worthy to visit Bali and Singapore : []
My only gripe about this hotel (and its not just this hotel either-they all seem the same in Nusa Dua) is they lack atmosphere during the day and night : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Last year we went here and then down to Legain - Padma Hotel : []
This is a very big hotel on the beach with every thing laid on : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We decided to try to make early check in because our plane arrives at 9 : [u'location', u'airport']
Besides that, everything was perfect : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Just what we need : []
It would have been good to receive warning about this so we could have visited when the building work had finished : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
However, I was glad that this resort has a lot of character : [u'amenities', u'pool']
The staff were amazing, very friendly and helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Went on holidays from Costa Rica to Bali with just a lot expectations : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
staff and management had flowers and a fruit bowl delivered to our room wishing our son a speedy recovery : [u'overall', u'culture']
This was our first time to visit Bai and although we had some concerns about the weather, and the deal itself, we were amazing : []
You will find lots of shopping and restaurants here : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Excellent facilities wonderful position, only a short walk to the Bali Collection and a cheap taxi fare to other Bali wonders : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
30am and almost all the lounges around the pool were already taken but remained empty till early afternoon : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
The food pretty ordinary : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
A lovely arrangement of flowers was in our room and staff all welcomed us with well wishes which was lovely at meals and in the club itself : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Every day after that, we put the "do not disturb" sign on the door so we could sleep in during the mornings : []
Everything is 3 times more expensive : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Reni and Dwi on the wedding team answered every question I had and believe me I had alot : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Thoroughly recommend staying here and we are about to book our next stay! : []
The Palace Suite was extremely comfortable and the staff in all the areas were excellent : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Just got around to writing about it now, but the memories have stayed with me and will do so for some time I think : []
The room was absolutely superb with mindblowing views of the Sea to one side and the pools to the other : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
We stayed half board which doesn't include drinks but once we got the hang of it it was ok : []
If I have to mention anything negative I would say that the check-out could be faster : [u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']
The kids club has daily activities, so you can leave the little ones there, while you go for a massage or table tennis : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
No one likes to go to the toilet slipping on tiles and squelching on a oversaturated bath towel mat : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
For the rest : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Note that the beach out the front of the resort is not a surfing beach as such, but the water is clear and the sand is yellow and clean : [u'location', u'sea']
It was a great size and our 3 yr old slept on a rollaway bed in the lounge area and our 18 month slept in a cot next to him : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
Friendly staff, wonderful beach and pool area : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

The day spa was lovely also : [u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool']
I used the spa for a number of massages and found all the services o f very good standard : []
This was our 7th visit to this authentic balianise type resort : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The lap pool was my favourite - just lie there for hours together with a good book under the tree : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym', u'pool', u'patio']
We found the staff extremely well trained and obliging : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
when in Bali it is the only place I'll stay : []
However, the hotel room was woeful : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
Would definitely come again on this promotion : [u'food-beverages', u'food-decor']
Easy walking distance to Bali Collection, but a little removed from busy tourist strip - which we loved : []
Having read many of the reviews about this hotel - I decided that it was good value for money and that the hotel itself was living up to its guests reputation : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Slightly more traditional Balinese style without the over the top Western influences : [u'overall', u'culture']
The checkout person had the temerity to suggest our understanding was the result of verbal discussions until we produced the documents : []
Another problem was mosqitoes which despite using repellent creames restrict our movements in hotel after sunset for the same reason we were not able to open door to our balcony : []
A quiet and beautiful location : [u'room-experience', u'noise']
The service was frequently bad : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Even though there were nightly activities going on right next door, the Nusa Dua was far quieter and far more quaint : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
A typical day here : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The staff at the palace club were awesome : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
There is a fully stocked mini-bar in the rooms and tea and coffee making facilities are provided but no fresh milk : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
We got married at this hotel in 2008 and had been dreaming of coming back for 2 years : []
The hotel has a lovely Balinese feel and the restaurants are good : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
My family and I stayed here for 4 nights : [u'overall', u'culture']
If your sporty, a spectacular jog along this stunning beach front, it has an up to date gym which has well maintained equipment, air-conditioned , and is supervised by trained staff : [u'amenities', u'conference']
It was really nice : []
We stayed in Bali for 8 days, the last hotel booked was the Nusa Dua Beach Resort & Spa hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Hotel staff can arrange cab : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
-2 glass water bottles (330ml each) provided in bathroom room each day : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
My 7 year old daughter said the kids club was terrible, they made cookies but weren't allowed to eat them : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The level of service, even for Bali, is amazing : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
This was by far the best : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
You can gaze far and have a lot of place to walk around while you sip on ur drinks : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On the flip side, rooms were a bit old and the breakfast had the same items everyday : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
The pools are excellent, very clean with staff continually cleaning the surrounds and grassed areas : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We toured two days while we were there : []
The spa is amazing, and open 16 hours a day,also adults only, so a very peaceful place,there are also three other pools to choose from,one with a swim up bar : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
Had 4th floor room (top floor) and it had a lovely view of pool and beach : []
Anyway, next time we will go to Bali we will go back to the Beach Hotel : [u'location', u'sea']
Management Dika in particular and Staff are wonderful : []
The hotel staf should maybe speak a little bit better English : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The location and grounds are beautiful, nice place to chill and relax and very cheap taxis ( blue Nusa Dua taxi) if you want to venture further afield for a while : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel was nice enough to give us rooms with pool&seaview : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The hotel is ten minutes away from Siminyak : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Rooms were clean and comfortable, staff were friendly : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
Can not fault anything : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
It was awesome experience on our 10 day stay : [u'overall', u'feel']
The staff are great, especially TARKAR - who met us at the airport and returned us all the way to the check-in desk on departure, even looking after all our luggage : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Service staff was helpful : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
The room they put us in was amazing : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
They were absolutely amazing as we're the complimentary chips Mushadi would also offer : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Also, if your visit is during monsoon season, you might want to bring the complimentary umbrella in the room for your Bali collection visit : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I went for the champagne ones! : []
I was very glad I upgraded to a Premier Room for not much greater cost, as it was probably quite a bit bigger and with better outlook than the regular rooms : []
This is also a good place to purchase souvenirs and local handicrafts : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We stayed in a Palace Club Room this time which gave us access to breakfast away from the masses as well as an evening cocktails : [u'amenities', u'conference']
I would not bother returning to this hotel again : []
They could not even attempt to throw us a ring to grab onto, since there were none : []
This was actually very pleasant, as we were pretty much the only two tourists on the mountain : []
Green spaces which were filled with birds that I enjoyed hearing when waking up in the morning : []
The front security checks are comforting, if you want to bargain without the high pressure, there are market places within 10 minutes walking and the restaurants, much cheaper than the resorts, but great quality also : [u'location', u'general']
We stayed for 5 nights in 1999, then again in 2003, & then lastly,2012 shortly after their $Multi-Million Dollar refit of the Hotel : []
Had a great lunch with friends in beautiful surroundings : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Although the price is abit higher then the city center can offer but it worth it : [u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife']
Again, it had a beautiful view, of the Temple Gardens this time, and the room was incredibly spacious and well maintained : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
There are many places to eat at the Bali Collection or walk out the main gate, slightly closer to the hotel and you will find more eateries : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The chef was first class : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
My mom and I both fell in the shower : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains']
The staff and facilities were A1 Everything you needed was within a short walk pool ,restaurants and bars : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall we had a lovely stay and would recommend this hotel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Food at Chess was great, and felt reasonably priced : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
We found this place on the internet ( http://www : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Loved the small ponds with fish and the squirels! : [u'food-beverages', u'meal', u'amenities', u'pool']
We were two couples visiting Bali and stayed here for a week in their Palace Club rooms : []
Because of this, we chose to dine away from the hotel so spent nothing more during our short stay than the cost of the room : []
My wife is looking forward to the Yoga class in the morning and I'm looking forward to relaxing on the private beach which is in a very beautiful location : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Very nice breakfasts, good variety of fresh fruit and vegetables : [u'food-beverages', u'meal']
Very nice rooms with great outlook : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The room looked out over stunning gardens - a wonderful way to wake up : [u'amenities', u'garden']
OMG we were blown away to say the least!!!! : []
Walking further, we realised that the resort is even bigger than what we initailly thought : []
We loved our stay at Nusa Dua Beach and Spa Resort : []
Beautiful gardens - great options for lazing on loungers and chilling away the days - we chose to set ourselves up under the trees on the beach so we could swim in the pools or ocean - pools get quite warm by lunch time so recommend morning swim in pools and ocean swims in the afternoon : [u'location', u'sea']
I stay in the palace wing which is excellent : [u'amenities', u'conference']
To be honest, my expectation for this hotel was not that high, because I have read that this hotel is the oldest hotel in the area, but because they offer great rate, I decided to try : []
I would go again, but I helps that I've become a massive fan of Bali : []
Swimminpool area is gorgeous, you can choose from two swimming pools : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Towards the end of our stay we found out the we had been upgraded twice! : []
Imho, either the Westin has a good value, or Nusa Dua Beach is too pricey : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The refurbished deluxe rooms are modern and well appointed; the bathroom design around the shower is not great as water leaks all over the floor when you use the shower, a clear design fault : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I have been to lot of 5 star hotels & I can easily recommend this hotel to everyone : []
It was a coupon deal which included 3 banquets, spas, transport to and from airport and a few other little goodies : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We hired bikes and took a tour down the beach touring the area : []
Very comfortable - though on the dining part was looking forward to some Indian dishes : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The staff were fantastic - always willing to help but not too intrusive : [u'services', u'in-room', u'general-service']
it's a heaven for the swimmers with multiple pool options facing the beach : []
We came back very relaxed : []
The little touches throughout our stay is what will have me return time over : []
Relaxation goal accomplished! : [u'location', u'sea']
Great experience all in all : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
We had the BBQ at the Asian restaurant one night, lunch at the chess bar another day, and breakfast each morning : []
A must try : []
We will be back and we will bring the family : [u'overall', u'culture']
We were on the 4 th floor which was great as we had a very large balcony the kids could play on outside : [u'overall', u'culture']
I'd encourage you to spend time here, since it will be worth it for a quite vacation or even with your whole family : []
Close to good beach, shops and restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
this hotel is lack of wifi : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It is evident that the administration is working very hard to make each and everyone comfortable and contented : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
There is one mall 'Bali collection' that is very close by, if you like shopping, but it is quite westernised in terms of the pricing : []
Great seafood : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
On the beach, extensive pools, enough sun lounges, food on call everywhere, magnificent breakfasts : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
But I was working, and the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is a beautiful facility with outstanding service : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I mean Four Seasons etc would be possibly be even better and the rooms quieter, but the price would be double/triple as well and overall this hotel really keeps at par with the best 5 star hotels while the effort from the hotel team is really worth the stay : [u'location', u'sea']
Overall it is not worth of the money : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
On arrival we where given a voucher for a mock cocktail which was a nice touch : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The package we got was good value, enjoying the spa and buffet nights : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
The service in the club lounge is impeccable, with true balinese grace : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Load of eating choices with an Indonesian, Asian, Italian and International Restaurants : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
The service was generally good, and its hard to complain about anything given the friendly and attentive manner of the Balinese staff : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
beach is even better : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
There is the usual saving of sun beds in the morning that is now prevalent , just go with the flow and go down and save yours when you wake up (or send an early riser) : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'bathtub']
A lovely, specious and grand hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Overall it's clean and relaxing and it never felt too busy, it has charm and a lil something about it : []
Safe, clean, friendly atmosphere : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The food in the restaurants varies from pick-up to the best of dining in all of Nusa Dua : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant', u'meal']
The staff were exceptional, the room lovely and we felt it was very good value for money : []
We are on night 3 out of 11 and have many good things to say about the hotel : []
- Once you head to the beach, be prepared for a lot of locals selling things and beach massages : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We will be returning in the not to distant future : []
The resort gardens are just beautiful - take the 1hour tour of the gardens with the head gardener : [u'amenities', u'garden']
The pools are good, however the sun lounges are quite dated old plastic ones and look due for replacement : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
They are plastic and look dated especially in comparison to the ones in the other hotels alongside Nusa Dua's beach : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Spotless beach & great gardens : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I noticed that some hotel staffs were more attentive and friendly to foreign guests than to local guests, please turn this mindset away, as the hotel guests there is no difference between local and foreigner as we deserved to have the same service : []
not the usual stuffed lobby-hotel types : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
We are on a business trip, that's why wifi connection is very important : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities']
But what you really want in a restaurant in Asia is good Asian food : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
I'm surprised to read the other positive reviews on this site and others : []
The pillows are not comfortable, need to change with 5 stars standard, the bed is ok : [u'room', u'clothing', u'linens']
The glass door controls the aircon when opened the aircon turns off and when closed it starts back up again : []
They have two beautiful swimming pools that really look nice in the evening with the lights on them : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Everywhere is clean and tidy : [u'overall', u'cleanliness']
The location is right by the beach next to many luxurious hotels : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
we stayed at this hotel for a week at the beginning of June 2009 with my husband for our 5 year wedding anniversary : []
The Pizza's are to die for : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Your people behaviour is super, : [u'overall', u'culture']
The grounds are lovely : [u'overall', u'safety']
It is nothing like Seminyak or Kuta/Legian so if you are looking for loads of shopping, restaurants or party time its probably not the place for you : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We had a lovely week at this hotel : []
Places To Try : [u'location', u'general']
Considering the rate that we got (was a good deal comparing to its neighbours), I would think this resort was excellent : [u'amenities', u'pool']
They ordered my wife one of those expensive taxis (ok, she was not experienced in that), but I complained and got the money partially back : []
It was already 1 : []
There was something for everyone from local, asian, continental, american and british : [u'location', u'general']
One of the reasons we booked the hotel is because it is older and has a strong Balinese influence, it is not just another generic resort (we could have stayed closer to home and got that!) : []
We (4 couples) recently stayed for 8 nights on a Luxury Escape deal : []
I would highly recommend this hotel : []
All the staff and the people in Bali were lovely they are so polite and work really hard I recommend bali and the hotel to anyone it was the best!! : []
Would recommend purchasing the packages as it is good value for money : []
This was the greatest disappointment for us : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Look nowhere else! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The entrance to the hotel complex is secured and very well taken care of : [u'amenities', u'elevator', u'services', u'pre-room', u'reception_desk']
Just completed only a short 2 night stay at NDBH : []
Best dinner experience during our stay at Nusa Dua : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
The breakfast spread is lavish and the restraints are all great : [u'overall', u'culture']
The hotel needs to be upgraded technologically, The Tv's were old and the in room wifi meant purchasing a pre paid wifi card from the gift shop : [u'amenities', u'conference']
We found this resort to be a very good value and were happy with our stay : []
a beautiful beach with lots of sun beds and a large option of water sports to choose from : [u'amenities', u'gym']
We also enjoyed snacks by the pool and daily drinks at the swim up pool bar : []
The resort and staff were amazing : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Didn't have a bad meal the 10 nights we were there : []
Even when we were booking the hotel, it tooks us numeorous emails and phone calls to achieve that : []
The 2 pools are very nice : [u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Loved the room, however, I think for the price, housekeeping could have been better, for example, the toilet door was timber slates and it was full of dust : []
Prepare to pay high prices for all items within the hotel - this is expected in a 5 Star Hotel and we didnt mind : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Would recommend a wedding there, it was lovely : []
We left Nusa Dua Beach Hotel/Bali with a smile on our faces, urning to come back : []
This is our 2nd visit to Nusa Dua Hotel Beach and Spa- the first for my daughter's wedding in 2009, and this last visit for a famiy holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
With 300 or so rooms its a big hotel but its well laid out and we found it to be very affordable : []
We stayed in a deluxe garden view room (after being shown a couple of other ones : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'room-experience', u'view', u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'amenities', u'gym']
It should be free, but instead there is a 600% mark up over the local shops : [u'amenities', u'shopping']
Hotel restaurants are a little pricey for Bali with a Bintang costing nearly $7 : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'restaurant', u'hotel-outside', u'nightlife', u'amenities', u'shopping']
Loved the spa treatments : [u'services', u'in-room', u'medical']
When we stayed last January, the spa cafe provided complimentary water by the pool, but this was no longer offered; also, the spa cafe didn't keep regular hours, and no one came around offering snacks or beverages, even though there was only 30% occupancy at the resort : [u'room', u'furniture']
But as it was our second last night the thought of chnaging was hard work and incovenient : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Was OK, facilities were good, though seems construction was bit old : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
As I said above the only detraction was the renovations that were occurring : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I found this site after we booked and was a little concerned about the reviews I was reading : []
The staff's appearance can be improved in many cases : [u'overall', u'culture']
Myself and my partner just came back from 12 nights at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The hotel carries a balinese feel : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
The main pools, no matter how many people were in and around it, never felt busy or noisy although the swim up pool bar did fill up at times (but the drinks were so delicious you can't really blame people for staying there) : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
This area of Bali is quite sanitized as I had heard, and the properties are very large, lacking that sense of personalized service : [u'room', u'furniture']
Taxi ride to kuta beach is a bit long but well worth staying at this amazing resort : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'bike-ride']
Yes I'm in Bali, I get it, but working at a resort isn't my living : [u'amenities', u'pool']
My husband and I stayed here for 10 nights for our honeymoon, and I can honestly say it was one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen! It is surrounded by fountains and large ponds full of fish and lilies, with temple-like parts to all the buildings making it feel very special : []
They are quiet, beautifully landscaped and maintained : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
This was our first visit to Bali and wanting a very restful relaxing holiday : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Dew in the breakfast room greated me every morning by name, with a huge smile and made sure I had my cup of coffee : []
provision of swim-shoes or flippers/snorkels would have been good : [u'overall', u'safety']
The character comes at a cost, however : [u'overall', u'aesthetics']
Especially if you're travelling with the family : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The girls do fabulous massages but it is essential to book : []
At one point there was a cute little squirrel playing in our balcony, which was very adorable : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Perfect start to the day! : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Food - we didnt eat in the 'main' restauant at all, as there are some many smaller, speciallty ones : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
In the end we changed to the Laguna (100m away, Westin between) : []
The breakfast was more than I expected : []
- the hotel was really restored over 10 years ago, but there's hardly anything outdated as much as to give it a negative opinion : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
It's a '5 star hotel' situated in a hot climate : [u'overall', u'culture']
There are a few bits and pieces that need improvement: on our arrival, the hotel room was not very clean, in particular the floors and also the bathroom could have done with an extra scrub : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower', u'bathtub', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'amenities', u'gym', u'elevator']
Not anything to do or to eat outside the hotel (if your not driving), and the beach was ok! But I will definitely recommend it to my friends! : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
The food is okay - more local Indonesian fare would have been appreciated but that's just preference : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Most of the staff were very attentive and helpful, but this was really a minor issue : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We now happily choose to stay there EVERY time we visit Bali : []
And flowers here and there as well : []
Wish I was there : []
The facilities were top notch and the food to match : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
They were also able to provide very good recommendations when we asked them : []
At the first night, I stayed at the deluxe room : []
Very friendly and attentive staff in the palace club area : [u'location', u'general']
Whilst the hotel runs a shuttle bus, we found this to be a pleasant walk and enjoyed the people/ hotel watching en route! : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Had a few $15 massages on the beach turn left on path and they are set up at the edge of the resort : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
At the last moment while we were there, we wanted to see Uluwatu but couldn't get in touch with our own guide so the hotel arranged another guide to take us there : []
The hotel grounds was well maintained and looked exactly the same, if not better, than it did then : []
cannot really fault it : []
All adds up to a return visit with extended family : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
The main thing that stands out about this wonderful place is the staff who are truly the most amazing people : [u'amenities', u'patio']
We aslo visited the Club lounge for the complimenary coctails which were great and served with small bites to eat which were delicious : [u'amenities', u'conference']
The hotel has a variety of choices, but we have to admit, that we didn't venture further than Chess! We just didn't want for anything! : []
The food at the shows (buffet) was not good,very poor in fact - except the desserts which were great : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Overall the stay was very relaxing, and would recommend this resort : [u'amenities', u'pool']
Thank you Nusa Dua beach hotel : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
I really think you should upgrade the rooms as its a shame that a hotel has a beautiful facade but terrible family rooms : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Very well maintained property : [u'room', u'furniture']
Brekafast was plentiful : []
They really are both a lot better in comparision : [u'amenities', u'recreation']
Unfortunately Nusa Dua isnt the place where you can walk to the main road and get something to eat : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
An excellent service well worth the additional monies : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
7 morning in a row is a bit passed it : [u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'yoga']
On the days that we stayed in the resort, the beach was lovely and the pool magnificent : [u'food-beverages', u'bar', u'hotel-outside', u'activities', u'snorkeling', u'location', u'sea']
Too big and crowded for our taste but it was our mistake : []
We stayed for one week in a Superior room and one week in a Palace Club Room : []
Very good rooms and very good service : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
Another issue was the Internet- free wi-fi only in lobby but very low speed! They offer only cable Internet on a vary high price! You could not use your smartphone on the pool as no wi-fi! : [u'amenities', u'conference']
Originally booked standard room but upgraded to Palace Club : [u'food-beverages', u'drinks']
Unfortunately there was a group of very loud and rough sorts that moved in half way through our stay - the type that start drinking at 9am at the pool bar, shout obscenities across the pool at each other etc : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
The rooms are fantastic : [u'room', u'bathroom', u'shower']
The resort is old but maintained well : [u'amenities', u'pool']
We also went to have some drink at their looks new Lobby Bar,excellent choices of cocktails and with the price we paid for that month promotion buy 1 get 1 we think it was quite acceptable : []
A glass of wine was around 10euro and a cocktail 15euro : [u'room', u'clothing', u'curtains', u'food-beverages', u'bar']
Great shopping, restaurants and pampering : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']
We will definitely be back and highly recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone who wants a very special holiday : [u'amenities', u'patio']
Spent a lot of time at the spa pool and made the most of the sauna, cold plunge pool etc : [u'amenities', u'gym']
As that was my birthday dinner, we dined at the special pavilion in the middle of the pool, with a dedicated waiter : []
The main let down of the hotel was the general admin/reception : [u'food-beverages', u'restaurant']
Very good service and facilities especially the kids club : [u'price-value', u'discount_rate']
This was our second stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our Wedding Anniversary : [u'services', u'pre-room', u'welcome']

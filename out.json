            " The duck spring rolls are to die for and the chocolate molten cake for desert", 
            " Unfortunately loungers are reserved by quite a few people and are not used for considerable amounts of time and the pool area would benefit from pool management", 
            " Last time it was exactly the same the food everyday", 
            " Our second time at your resort and hopefully will return again next year", 
            " It has a lovely beach resort ambience", 
            "\nThe resort was very beautiful, but the service that was offered the resort was very poor", 
            "\nI thoroughly enjoyed my 8 night stay at this wonderful resort", 
            " Service in the pool bar is slow too", 
            " The staff at the pool bar are playful! The cocktails were delicious and the menu of good was delicious! One of the best nasi goreng i have had in bali! The staff at the front desk were incredibly helpful, we checked out but wanted to keep our luggage there due to a late flight, the staff allowed us to access our luggage with ease and also let us remain in the public areas for the day (pool and restaurant and lobby) and also offered us a room with showers to prepare for the flight home", 
            " The aircon had issues the first two days we were there as did the water to our rooms, this was fixed fairly quickly though and the staff are very accommodating", 
            " The resort s along side the Discovery Mall so easy shopping is close at hand", 
            " Huge disappointment with the infinity pool, as well, as it was like a 3x6m thing near the Boardwalk restaurant, with tables in front of it, so no possibility of actually admiring the ocean from the pool", 
            "Overall: Large, commercial, good-looking resort right on the beach with no character", 
            " The same goes for both pool areas and pool lounges always covered in leaves and berries and sometimes ants as well, very untidy looking at all times of the day", 
            " I used to love this resort but they obviously have so many more customers now they cannot provide the service", 
            " The hotel does have a great pool, and as other reviewers have commented excellent poolside service (swim up bar) but the surrounds were generally poorly cleaned overnight and the pool is badly lit at night", 
            " There is a great pool for families with a swim up bar and behind that is a great pool just for adults with lovely areas to Chill out and is so tranquil", 
            " Separate pool just for adults too", 
            " I enjoyed the pool but the main pool was too hot and after an hour or so, I had to go sit in the salt water pool for 30 mins\n", 
            " It's only available free at the pool near the boardwalk and it barely works, at the other pool you can forget it no chance of free WiFi", 
            "\nVery well situated resort with direct access to the beach", 
            " There was free wifi by the pool, or for a minimal fee ($2", 
            " The Resort was well positioned, had large deluxe rooms, fantastic breakfasts & three pools, one of which was just for adults", 
            " Also in the relatively expensive Bali Garden Resort it was inevitable to run into groups of tattooed Aussies that opened their first Bintangs straight after breakfast by the poolside", 
            " Resort is also affiliated with the bars and restaurants out front and so you get a hotel discount", 
            " The Adults only pool was a great touch, pity the swim up bar wasn't in this pool though", 
            " This is Avery nice resort in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Kuta", 
            " The drivers attached to the resort are helpful and drive well to the busy roads", 
            " I never wanted to leave the resort", 
            " Water bomb is 1 minute walk", 
            " In hindsight this is a blessing in disguise as it gets your children out of the hotel room, off their ipads and exercising in the swimming pool", 
            " The resort has excellent facilities, multiple bars & restaurants and its compact size makes it easy to get around the resort", 
            "\nThe resort has everything you need for a family vacation", 
            " Hopefully whilst you are there you will get to see the giant lizard swimming through the pond (thought it was a croc when I first saw it :) A big thanks to all the staff, we had a fantastic time", 
            "\nWe couldn't fault this resort", 
            " Beautiful Gardens, great Spa prices, 3 swimming pools, great restaurant prices (some of the resorts we have stayed at in the past charge waaay too much for their services)", 
            " The best part of the resort is that they have 3 swimming pools, each to cater to the kind of swimming you like- one facing the sea, another pool in the middle of the resort which had a bar and a small one which was more of a lounge pool", 
            " Out the front is a paved pathway separating the resort from the beach that goes for 2-3 klm", 
            "\nStayed at this resort for the second time it is just amazing", 
            " Staff were very attentive around the pool", 
            " Staff are excellent and I would have no problem recommending this resort to any of my friends or family", 
            " Only thing though was the water pressure was a bit average", 
            " There is an adults only pool away from the main pool too as well as an infinity pool right up the front near the restaurants", 
            " The pool was not huge, but very accessible and not too busy to get a seat most of the time", 
            " The pool is great with the poolside bar being very convenient and made for a lot of fun", 
            "The pools were nice, the swim up bar area was great and the adults only pool was peaceful", 
            " Dirty water, toilets are filthy dirty", 
            " As we had 3 children, we did not visit the adults only pool, but two of our travelling group spent most of their days in this pool, so it must have had appeal", 
            " On arrival, we were upgraded to interconnecting rooms right near the pool area", 
            "The pool bar is great", 
            " The only bad thing I would say is the main pool needed a little attention with the mold growing on the steps and on the pool seats and tables", 
            " Pool area is fantastic, with 3 swimming pools", 
            " Many hours were spent relaxing in the pool area over the 7 days", 
            " Pool bar staff really great though", 
            " There is an adults pool though - although we preferred to chill out the front by the beach", 
            " You get half an hour free wi-fi when checking in that you can use in the bar or pool area and you can purchase more ($10 p/hr)", 
            "there are three pools, the adults only secluded pool with a large spa, fountain and water jets, small shaded bungalos and comfortable lounges for sun tanning though many trees shade the area which we liked", 
            " The main pool is well designed and is back far enough from the ocean front to allow a little privacy", 
            "And a pool right on the beach, it is awesome to see the sunset in the pool", 
            " The rooms were quite old but was very comfortable and has everything you need,the pool and swim up bar was great and made great cocktails at a reasonable price", 
            " And this resort did! The rooms were just fine", 
            " Have recommended this resort to family and friends", 
            "What a great resort and location,had a wonderful time just relaxing and visiting the many restaurants they have in the resort", 
            " Big swimming pool", 
            " I didn't really check since staying too long around the pool is not my thing", 
            " No one gets a water view so if you ask for your room to over look the water it is not possible", 
            " I believe they have swimming pool and beach access behind their hotel", 
            " The main pool where the swim up bar is is excellent", 
            " The facilities were great and we spent a lot of time in the pool or relaxing around it", 
            "the pool is nice ,great for family or groups ", 
            " Central to a few shopping centers in Kuta, across the road from Water Bom Park if you have kids and walking distance to a large range of market stalls, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, retail shops and beauty spots for awesome massages and facials", 
            " Three pools one adults only really nice , this resort is central to everything in Kuta I do prefer Legian but overall a fabulous holiday! Staff at reception were lovely staff around pool not so", 
            " Our favourite part of the hotel was the main pool, we enjoyed lazy afternoons and late night cool offs after our days of shopping and exploring", 
            " Pool was nice, but even though it's supposed to be open to 10pm, we were asked to exit the pool at 8pm one night because that's what time they add the daily chemicals - be aware of this", 
            "\nThis is a fantastic place to stay it is only 5-10 minutes from the airport, the staff here are always friendly an greet you everyday with a smile, 3 pools to choose from the adults only pool, the main pool and the salt water pool which has a view of the ocean, it is right on the beach it is located in south kouta right opposite waterbomb park , next door to a huge shopping centre and you can walk into kuta where all the night life are, my only concern is that you have to pay for wifi all the time unless buy the pool were you get free wifi but this was our 3rd stay at Bali gardens and we love it\n", 
            " All in all a great resort\n", 
            " The adult swimming pool was lovely and the gardens are impressive", 
            " Over all wouldn't consider any other resort", 
            " The adult pool was good but not enough sunlounges and the main pool was awful with lots and lots of 'Bogan' Aussies and splashing children everywhere!! The food in the Boardwalk restaurant was ok, breakfast was pretty good, but get in early as it fills up with lots of annoying people by 8:30am", 
            "we used adult pool children free very quiet and relaxing holiday ,staff all friendly boardwalk restaurant really good ,the cocktail bar has the best bloody marys in baliLee\n", 
            " This time we unfortunately struck some drunk Aussies down at the pool area, the staff did asked them several times to be quiet", 
            " The Gardeners and Pool cleaners that keep the pathways clear and all the pools clean", 
            " The only slight downside was wifi was so slow around the pool and Boardwalk restaurant", 
            "a fantastic place to kick back and enjoy the sun and atomsphere of the pool bar and all it has to offer", 
            " This happened a few times when down at the pool ", 
            " I would highly recommend this resort to anyone - I love being one of the Bali Garden Beach Resort \"family\" members and we will definitely be going back",

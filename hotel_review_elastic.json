In the past it saw its day, as it is in a pretty good location, i.e. its back overlooks Juhu Beach, it has palm trees and not bad architecture. It's not on the busy part of Juhu Beach where all the booths are, that's about half a mile or so to the south. I booked a standard room, and when I arrived I asked to see it. I was shown a tacky, sterile room with dirty walls. I believe I was shown it as an incentive to get me to take the more expensive room, which I did, though it wasn't a whole lot better. At least, no bugs. Fairly clean room. Nice exterior to some of the rooms, but overall a place in need of repair and renovation. Standard rooms are shameful. Guards at the gate prevent riffraff, but otherwise, the rooms provide little security. I show photo of flimsy door lock, and bathroom window anybody could break into. Outdoor \"lawn\" is a sad joke; not a blade of grass, a dirt area with a tragically worn out, rotted away red carpet that bride and groom walk down, when wedding parties rent their \"lawn\" overlooking the sea. Dirty, chipped chairs and tables in outdoor restaurant, I wouldn't dream of eating there. Fortunately the Razzberry Rhinoceros disco at this hotel is now closed; that would have been noisy. Speaking of noise, the kitchen staff washes dishes loudly all night right behind the guest rooms, and the slotted bathroom window lets the outside noise in. I use earplugs, so could live with that. I learned that the hotel owner lives in the most exclusive part of Mumbai. He should take a few bucks and make the rooms nicer, get new outdoor furniture, pave the parking lot, get new softer mattresses, add an internet connection. TV, phone; no fridge, no safe, no internet, no bathtub. Shower is just part of the bathroom, no curtain. But hey, while using the toilet, if you lean a bit to the left and turn on the water, you can take care of two things at once! Mattresses VERY thin and not soft at all. No internet connection, though I asked the staff at night and they were nice and let me use the hotel's computer to check my e-mail. I didn't try any of the food, I ate elsewhere. (The Marriott Juhu Beach is almost next door and you can walk over for a superb breakfast buffet; it's a FAR better, cleaner, more professional hotel, no comparison.) Across the street from the Juhu Hotel is a dry cleaners and a Baskin-Robbins ice cream store. At night the street out front is impassable due to traffic; crossing is impossible. Lots of kids driving, and families out. I would give it maybe one and a half stars. I wouldn't stay there unless I had to; I did, because I was attending a conference near the airport but couldn't afford the tariff at the big hotels near the airport. If I had it to do over, I'd bite the bullet and try to get a good rate at one of them instead.\n", "id": 5}, {"review_id": 6, "sentiment": {"shower": "Negative", "checkin": "Positive", "aesthetics": "Positive", "spacious": "Positive", "discount_rate": "Neutral"}, "city_id": "bali", "attribute_line": {"shower": 6, "checkin": 4, "aesthetics": 3, "spacious": 5, "discount_rate": 7}, "attribute_list": [{"value": "shower"}, {"value": "checkin"}, {"value": "aesthetics"}, {"value": "spacious"}, {"value": "discount_rate"}], "hotel_id": 314, "adjective_list": {"shower": [], "checkin": [], "aesthetics": ["well", 35.999999999999979], "spacious": ["spacious", 1.9999999999999996], "discount_rate": ["good", 39.977716991336109]}, "score": {"shower": 1.0, "checkin": 1.0, "aesthetics": 1.0, "spacious": 0.25, "discount_rate": 1.0}, "location": {"lat": 19.0233992, "lon": 72.83478819999999}, "complete_review": "\nHad to spend a night in Central Mumbai.

Here, we enjoyed best of delicacies, desserts, confectionary prepared by chefs in training. All our special needs were met by quick efficient service. The location itself in the heart of Dadar, Mumbai was blessing in disguise since Hinduja Hospital is about 10 minutes away.

Generally all rooms are plain and simply put - functional! But thats the beauty. You get a bed, table chair, a TV, etc, \"adjusted\" in the a typical Mumbai style. The washroom is cleanish - for the price you pay. The towels are crisp though they may have been laudered a few hundred times and may not look very white. But remember you are in a budget hotel.The best part is the food. It is hot, spicy, and delicious ( this opinion is personal - depends on how you like it). the service is effiecient and fast and ever helpful. They will get you anything from toothpaste to scotch whisky at your doorstep!There is one more good point.

The hotel managers were fairly helpful (Monu and Sonu) if not a little dismissive at times, and the other staff were very friendly. The hotel has in parts a colonial charm about it. It was a real shame then that on the day we checked out, the staff made it very obvious that they were hoping for a tip by coming up to the room several times saying they were going 'off shift' before all waiting outside, and when that didn't work, directly asking. I didn't oblige as the service wasn't great and we had to ask for our room to be cleaned every day otherwise it was left.

Bad choice!I checked in after 4pm, and had to wait 20 mins for the room to be made up. When I was told it was ready, I went up in the (very noisy) lift and found 2 guys still cleaning it. It was a total mess! Empty bottles everywhere, dirty sheets etc...After another 5 minutes, they said it was ready. I checked the balcony, and saw bird sh** all along it. Hey, if you're paying for a balcony, it should at least be clean enough to stand on, right?

In the past it saw its day, as it is in a pretty good location, i.e. its back overlooks Juhu Beach, it has palm trees and not bad architecture. It's not on the busy part of Juhu Beach where all the booths are, that's about half a mile or so to the south. I booked a standard room, and when I arrived I asked to see it. I was shown a tacky, sterile room with dirty walls. I believe I was shown it as an incentive to get me to take the more expensive room, which I did, though it wasn't a whole lot better. At least, no bugs. Fairly clean room. Nice exterior to some of the rooms, but overall a place in need of repair and renovation. Standard rooms are shameful. Guards at the gate prevent riffraff, but otherwise, the rooms provide little security. I show photo of flimsy door lock, and bathroom window anybody could break into. Outdoor \"lawn\" is a sad joke; not a blade of grass, a dirt area with a tragically worn out, rotted away red carpet that bride and groom walk down, when wedding parties rent their \"lawn\" overlooking the sea. Dirty, chipped chairs and tables in outdoor restaurant, I wouldn't dream of eating there. Fortunately the Razzberry Rhinoceros disco at this hotel is now closed; that would have been noisy. Speaking of noise, the kitchen staff washes dishes loudly all night right behind the guest rooms, and the slotted bathroom window lets the outside noise in. I use earplugs, so could live with that. I learned that the hotel owner lives in the most exclusive part of Mumbai. He should take a few bucks and make the rooms nicer, get new outdoor furniture, pave the parking lot, get new softer mattresses, add an internet connection. TV, phone; no fridge, no safe, no internet, no bathtub. Shower is just part of the bathroom, no curtain. But hey, while using the toilet, if you lean a bit to the left and turn on the water, you can take care of two things at once! Mattresses VERY thin and not soft at all. No internet connection, though I asked the staff at night and they were nice and let me use the hotel's computer to check my e-mail. I didn't try any of the food, I ate elsewhere. (The Marriott Juhu Beach is almost next door and you can walk over for a superb breakfast buffet; it's a FAR better, cleaner, more professional hotel, no comparison.) Across the street from the Juhu Hotel is a dry cleaners and a Baskin-Robbins ice cream store. At night the street out front is impassable due to traffic; crossing is impossible. Lots of kids driving, and families out. I would give it maybe one and a half stars. I wouldn't stay there unless I had to; I did, because I was attending a conference near the airport but couldn't afford the tariff at the big hotels near the airport. If I had it to do over, I'd bite the bullet and try to get a good rate at one of them instead.\n", "id": 53}, {"review_id": 53, "sentiment": {"discount_rate": "Negative"}, "city_id": "bali", "attribute_line": {"discount_rate": 0}, "attribute_list": [{"value": "discount_rate"}], "hotel_id": 259, "adjective_list": {"discount_rate": ["bad", 59.000000000000064]}, "score": {"discount_rate": 1.0}, "location": null, "complete_review": "\nHad stayed in the hotel on 28th August and found it to be just ok  It's in the main junction of santacruz and very noisy till about midnight Food was also not great and not upto the standards needs a lot of improvement, if you are ok with these and are only concerned about price factor or good deal then go for it\n", "id": 53}, {"review_id": 54, "sentiment": {"general-service": "Positive", "discount_rate": "Positive", "restaurant": "Positive"}, "city_id": "bali", "attribute_line": {"general-service": 2, "discount_rate": 5, "restaurant": 3}, "attribute_list": [{"value": "general-service"}, {"value": "restaurant"}, {"value": "discount_rate"}], "hotel_id": 259, "adjective_list": {"general-service": [], "discount_rate": [], "restaurant": []}, "score": {"general-service": 1.0, "discount_rate": 0.0, "restaurant": 1.0}, "location": null, "complete_review": "\nWe have been staying in Regency since the last 10 years.

The hotel stands on the Western Express Highway, near the Vakola Traffic Guard, making it accessible through all possible options.

Since its located on the highway, getting a cab or an auto is never a problem. Public buses are also available in numbers. Juhu beach is quite nearby and for the shopaholics Bandra is not too far off either.Now coming to the hotel services, the rooms are fairly big, clean and airy. The staff is helpful. I have always had mixed feelings about room service every time I visit, so i would say that area would require a little supervision. Food is good but overpriced. The buffet breakfast is boring with almost the same menu everyday. Housekeeping would get full points as being the messy kind I am, every evening I would come back to my room to find it sparkly clean. For the rooms, I prefer the ones at the back side of the hotel as they are relatively quieter and gives a good view of the aeroplanes flying off from the nearby airport. The ones on the front side are very noisy from mumbai's 24*7 nonstop traffic. As for the in room facilities it differs from room to room, I really did not get why. For eg, some rooms come with a hair drier, while in others it's missing. However all the rooms come with a tea coffee maker so that's a blessing.

Moreover, they offer a complimentary transportation service (with driver standing with placard at the airport) for receiving and dropping at the airport. Also the location of hotel is such that you always get taxi, autos etc just outside. 2.0> Complimentary breakfast is superb for a hotel of this level at Mumbai. Complimentary dinner is also nice.

For those looking to stay within this area, this hotel is value for money. The rooms are clean and adequately furnished, and one can get a quiet night's sleep here. However, the pillows need to be renewed and the towels are also beginning to age. The restaurant is quite nice and the buffets are rather good with a spread of vegetarian dishes and 2 non-vegetarian dishes daily. The breakfast menu is not bad at all. I see some of you have complained about the food here, but I found absolutely nothing wrong with it; in fact it was delicious and served hot, and I was happy to have a clean and hygienic restaurant in this part of town. If you are doing a course at MASSA or BP Marine, this hotel is literally a stone's throw away from the latter and about 1.5 km down a straight road to MASSA. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful, right from the security guard, to the concierge, reception, restaurant staff and the manager. The gym is a bit worn out with creaky and broken machines, so if you are looking for a daily workout, you should look elsewhere. There is fairly large parking area for guests' vehicles inside the compound. The swimming pool appeared fairly clean considering that I was there during the monsoons and no-one particularly wanted to use it. The air conditioning units worked fine in all the 4 rooms that I had stayed in during my repeated visits and the housekeeping was good. The bathrooms are small, but clean. Overall a rather nice hotel with a homely feel to it and smiling faces all around. I will go back to K Stars if I ever need to stay in Belapur again.

The only grace was a balcony.The staff are sometimes rude and forgetful. While having breakfast, one of my companions requested the staff if he could get him a second helping of UPMA. To this the shocking reply was \"aapko khud uthke lena parega\"(You have to get up and get it yourself). I have never heard such a rude reply even from people in a roadside dhaba. The staff present were rather reluctant to serve. They never filled up the glass with drinking water until asked for. The choice and variety of food available at the buffet was very limited. For breakfast only one type of fruit was available. For Dinner only one type of dessert was available. So there was no sugar free sweet available. This should now be included in a standard Menu with more and more people getting diabetes. During a dinner session we ordered a plate of chicken tikka. It was awful. The boneless chicken pieces were first boiled, cooked and preserved. Then on getting the order these were skewered and superficially heated on an open Sigree for a few minutes.The room service was also very poor. Once I ordered a pot of tea and it was served to another room. On another occasion, I had ordered Chicken Clear Soup and Ice Cream for dinner. The Ice Cream was served after about 20 minutes whereas being a ready item, it should come faster. But the simple soup came separately after another 30 minutes. The Menu for In-room dining is elaborate but as I suspected and later found out, in reality, they do not serve many of those items.The hotel offers drop and pickup services in a common car. We asked for a separate car and agreed to pay the charges. But the person at the front desk reluctantly agreeing to it never kept a note of it or may be they do not have a system of maintaining log for such things at the front desk and the person coming in the next shift had no idea about our request.The hotel does not have any fire fighting equipment or none was visible. The doors in the rooms have no safety chain or peep holes.May be the Hotel Management is not bothered because it proudly displays Trip Adivsor's Certificate and happy with it.\n", "id": 157}, {"review_id": 157, "sentiment": {"general-service": "Positive", "bar": "Negative"}, "city_id": "bali", "attribute_line": {"general-service": 1, "bar": 0}, "attribute_list": [{"value": "general-service"}, {"value": "bar"}], "hotel_id": 458, "adjective_list": {"general-service": ["friendly", 32.883567280767615], "bar": []}, "score": {"general-service": 1.0, "bar": 3.5}, "location": null, "complete_review": "\nWell appointed rooms, healthy breakfast, evening maifil & affable behavior of the boys & girls of the Restaurant & Front Desk made my stay cozy.

The menu has sufficient choices in veg and non veg sections and the bar is also is of good quality. One thing that I liked most is that they do not charge you extra if you ordering in room which takes bother from you as the way to restaurant is from outside the hotel main building but inside the premises.

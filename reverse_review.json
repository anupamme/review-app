        "The room was a bit disappointing; I paid extra money for ocean view, which was obscured by the trees in the garden, the room was attached to another, and we could hear the conversation in the room next to us; the shower (my room was with shower corner) had a small glass partition, which resulted in water splashing all over the bathroom; WiFi in the room is available at additional cost, which I find strange for a 5* hotel, while most of the restaurants in nearby Bali Collection offer this service free",

        "Just need the Exec Chef to address the overall standard in buffet dinners and Maguro as well",
        "I would recommend the pizza restaurant (although it's expensive by Bali standards)",

        "The pizza is superb, the \"jamu\" at the breakfast is one of the best I have had in hotels",
        "The service was excellent, however the strangest incident happened when my husband paid cash, the cashier at the salon did not give him any change, and only did so after he requested the change, he assumed they had thought it was a tip but still I don't think this is correct practice",

        "The food is bland, sadly so with wonderful fresh ingredients and spices this was disappointing",

        "The food was great, the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful and the amenities within the complex and room were faultless",
        "The hotel has classic appeal which distinguishes itself from neighbouring hotels which are very modern western looking",
        "The food delicious and at breakfast it is a monumental array of food from all customers no matter where they lived what ever was desired was in front of you and each day you can taste food to see what it is and how it tastes seen so much food put out for mulitnational travellers",

        "3rd stay and again loved it,brilliant staff, beaches and food,had the luxury escape package this time- great value though not much variety in chess set lunches and very confusing trying to explain that we had paid an upgrade fee so our children were free- I think to avoid the confusion that they should have their own passports to be stamped and have the staff just cross out the massage and scuba diving that's not included for them feel non alcoholic beverages should be supplied at the buffet dinners as cost adds up when purchasing these additionally, rooms are becoming a bit tired and can be quite noisy, we were kept up by the guest next doors television on a few occasions so sound proofing isn't the best, another suggestion would be to add a pizza option to the kids menu, we travelled with another family and all of the kids were wanting pizza ( which btw the pizza at Sandros is the BEST!) We look forward to our next trip",

        "One thing that I wish to highlight from this hotels is the service standard does not meet a 5 stars hotel that I expected",
        "I noticed that some hotel staffs were more attentive and friendly to foreign guests than to local guests, please turn this mindset away, as the hotel guests there is no difference between local and foreigner as we deserved to have the same service",
        "I stayed with my wife and two children (5 & 8) and found the atmosphere, service, food and amenities to be excellent",

        "They do serve 3 different types of dishes every day, but probably my expectation on this is too high",
        "and we also had In Indonesian night and were looking forward to the satay on offer but were sorely disappointed when only lamb skewers were available and were told the chicken was too expensive to give us yet chicken satay was offered everyday on the poolside menu",
        "The spa is totally worth it, specially the sauna and jacuzzi deserves at least an hour everyday :) the keckak dance with lobster dinner is also a most!!",
        "We have stayed at three of the hotels in Nusa Dua",
        "The service was also not very good",
        "As I am not a coffee drinker, I drink Diet Coke in the morning and after two days of having it at the breakfast area, on the third day a waiter told me that they didn't offer diet coke in that restaurant",

        "However this did not cause any discomfort while taking nice naps after lunch on the calm and peaceful beach",
        "There is a few restaurants and we got an enjoyable dinner at the one on the beach a few times but it was pretty espensive (12AUD for a main) compared to prices in Sanur and Ubud (3-6AUD for a main) Overall a nice expirience but probably would stay 3 or even 2 nights instead of 4 as its wonderful for relaxing but not for much else",
        "Normally when you visit a particular country, you want to indulge in the local cuisine",

        "The pools are nice, as expected the food was very expensive",

        "Food at the restaurants was reliably very good and service always very friendly",
        "If we get a chance to go top Bali again any time soon, I would probably try Sanur as I would like to able to walk to nearby restaurants and have easier access to trips to ubud",
        "Restaurants were a little bit of a letdown in that everything was just average",

        "It rained whilst we were there and we could not walk to any of the restaurants so room service had to do,but instead of opening the coffee shop and encouraging the hotel guests to go there they hotel was happy to see people clambering for a seat on the shuttle to the galleria",
        "The food was good but service rather impersonal particularly given we had a 2 week stay",
        "The service from all the staff was exceptional and best wished to all the trainees who have been doing work placement at the Hotel - you have great role models! Loved the invitation to attend the General Manager's Cocktail Party - great to meet the GM - Urs and the amazing and very talented Aussie Chef - Geoff Clarke",
        "But it made us stay at the hotel more and discover every facilities it has",
        "food choices are a tad limited for indians and thats the one thing they can work to improve - though they are quick to get you stuff when asked , but nicer to see it on a menu upfront",

        "All in all, a great hotel with great service",
        "5 star hotels often charge a lot and they see their clients as $$$! Well, there is nothing wrong with offering excellent service and ask for the price but of course it is very important to offer such service with friendly staff and values",
        "In my opinion, many 5 star hotels got used to high charges but gradually forget about their differentiation and usually they do nothing different than an ordinary hotel which is not expected to offer you much",
        "At least in non 5 star hotels you don't pay much and don't expect much even but mostly they offer better services",
        "If you give a tip to a bell boy he will be very glad and thankful but in 5 star hotels this is your duty!",

        "We were not overly impressed by the quality of the food and a soft drink or a water was almost $5AUD with tax and service",
        "Most of the restaurants will collect you and drop you back to your hotel for free (if you can plan this in advance or call them if you know where you want to eat)",

        "I discovered that the Palace Club had been extended outside to allow for more tables, and that a small kitchen was now outside too",
        "I'm not fond of this system as choice is limited, and I feel that the food was far less enjoyable than it had been on previous occasions, and quality nowhere near as good",
        "The food is great and service excellent - some of the waiters have been there since the hotel opened! The only negative we had was that our room wasn't ready so checkin was delayed which was a negative but I should have gone to the bar and not let it worry me",

        "The food was great and very reasonable, yes a bit more than outside but still a great price",

        "It was a bit embarrassing watching some people carry a few pieces of whole fruit out of the restaurant to have later - does this happen all the time? I wouldn't have dreamt of doing that",
        "The food in restaurant and room service are delicious, but the price very expensive (especially in restaurant) and be ready to wait, its need 25 mnts for room service",

        "I stayed here with my family & found to my delight that The hotel service was exceptional & staff very polite",
        "Highly recommend take the pre paid dinner option through the travel agt as it turned out to be excellent value",

        "The afternoon tea service was incredibly indulgent with tiered stands of sandwiches, scones and cakes being of high quality and beautifully presented",
        "Yes the meals were cheaper than those at the hotel, but the quality of the food was in no way comparable to hotel meals and the service was non-existent",
        "The absence of a menu board may deter people from dining due to a perception that it is exclusive and expensive",
        "Overall, I was impressed with the property, the standard of food overall and the smiling, professional staff",
        "There are several restaurants in the hotel, good ones, 3 swimmingpools, a great clean beach",

        "The hotel is a great option if you are looking to stay in a nice place but still feel like you are in Bali - a lot of the other hotels in Nusa Dua could be anywhere in the world and you wouldn't know",
        "Food not too expensive",
        "The hotel is located right on the beach with some lovely restaurants",
        "Perhaps it was because we had stayed at smaller hotels with a more personalised service and this was a larger hotel",
        "However, we should have looked into the Nusa Dua area a bit more before booking, it was quite bland and I think if we were to go back again we would choose the Seminyak area to stay in as it had great restaurants and atmosphere",
        "Hotel Service (10 out of 10)",
        "The facilities are very good",
        "Food (8 out of 10)",

        "The breakfast in the Palace Club was very nice, the meals by the pool for lunch were actually very good",

        "We visit many 4 - 5 star hotels in Bali in various places and have stayed in most hotels in Nusa Dua",
        "This hotel is now completing big renovations which are hardly creating any inconvenience to guests as the hotel has 3 wings and they are spread far apart",
        "In their reviews other guests often report that Nusa Dua is lacking Balinese vibe, but we strongly disagree with them",
        "Nusa Dua as elsewhere has predominately been occupied by locals, and all the hotels employ local people and wherever you stay with their wonderful smile and great attitude they always make Bali so special",
        "At the same time to all Balinese working in different places for making us feel so special",
        "Do not stay here for dinner, take a metered taxi into nusa Dua centre",

        "for indian meals visited gateway of india restaurant which the hotel had suggested",
        "fantastic food,",
        "I have no problem in moving to these lounges if they are left empty , hotels always say they enforce a no reservation rule on sunbuds but never do, much easier to enforce the rule yourself",
        "in room dining was ok, i did get sick from 1 meal ordered in house which always puts you out of action for a day but my wife had no problems",
        "Relaxing, clean, amazing breakfast with a wide choice of food to suit various tastes, Lovely gardens and swimming pools although the lagoon pool needs updating as the surface is rough, beach area is clean and has a lovely pathway for lazy walks, staff are attentive, friendly, kind people and the service is excellent",
        "Asian food through to dohnuts and local fruits",
        "Food is expensive and \"special event\" nights grossly overpriced, but on the whole, we were more than happy to eat lunch and have drinks/ccktails and felt that they were worth it",

        "They were very popular with the guests",
        "My Fiance and I ate at two of the restaurants at the resort, the Chess Restaurant and the Sandros restaurant, both of which were really nice and really friendly, both again compared to the rest of Bali quite pricey however when you stay in Nusa Dua you expect prices at resorts to be quite a lot higher than the general average, we were paying around 400,000 a meal with the main and drinks",
        "Good service oriented staff in most areas",
        "Food items run out fast due to crowds during holiday season but this is no excuse for staff to be slow in replenishing the items",
        "The egg station chef informed us that there were no more mushrooms for the day and this was at 9",
        "There are insufficient variety of local dishes",
        "Mostly only the basic international fare",

        "There are also some restaurants in the Bali Collection with competitive prices and decent food",
        "Advice: The only advice I have for this hotel and Nusa Dua area is, make sure you eat at some of the restaurants outside of the gates, they have fantastic food and are so much cheaper than the hotel",
        "The only thing which was a bit inconvenient was the fact other restaurants were a little bit futher from the hotel so if you decide to eat at the hotel it is a bit more expensive(but then this is Nusa Dua-bit more upmarket) It was very quiet compared to Legian/Kuta but then that was the reason we stayed there before going to stay at Legian",

        "For the 8 days we stayed in four hotels, including the neighbouring The Laguna and Discovery Partika in Kuta",
        "Nusa Dua is nice, but if you're expecting to do watersports, most the interesting stuff is 4km down the road from these hotels",

        "The staff was overall friendly and the service was indulging",
        "The hotel itself was beautifully clean and well maintained and the service we got was just incredible",
        "The food itself was good quality and not overly expensive considering the hotel is 5 stars",
        "The rooms were really lovely, clean and very large with great bathrooms, we had a Jacuzzi bath and a double shower in ours, and the whole room had everything you could need, the laundry service was fine (nothing shrunk or lost!) and there was a huge TV/stereo/DVD player if you just felt like staying out of the sun for a lie-in",
        "There are a few restaurants around which are nice too, not much nightlife but Kuta is just down the road",
        "The food here was delicious and the prices were what we expected for an upscale, luxury beach resort",
        "Great hotel, service, attentiveness from the staff, cleanliness, good variety of activities",
        "GREAT, I mean GREAT spa service",
        "However, since the hotel still has the label as being one of the \"leading hotels of the world\", expectations need to be setted right:",
        "For this the whole facility is too dated, the food variance and sophistication is too little and just many view little things",

        "Food and drink is quite pricey in the hotel",
        "If you do stay here, make sure to go to Tropical and Bumbu Bali restaurants, which are located outside of the hotel complexes",
        "These restaurants collect you and drop you home",
        "The food was lovely, with a never ending range of fresh fruit juices",
        "A short walk to Bali Collection or outside the main gates and the food is dirt cheap but still with fantastic service",
        "If you do decide to venture out of the hotel for dinner, head to the Tropical in Nusa Dua, at which the food was tasty and very reasonable",
        "good service",
        ") I highly recommend staying here, and yes the food may bit a bit $$$ than being in Kuta, but that;s the choice you make either stay in a 5 star hotel and don't whinge or go",

        "If You do not want to have all Your meals at the hotel there are some restauarants( and also shops) right outside the gate into Nusa Dua area, it takes about 10minutes to walk (and if You do not want to walk all restaurants have transportation)",

        "The service was very poor and as for the english language skills well",

        "The best point of this hotel was the food (I didn't expect such quality and variety) and the service",
        "The property is shabby and does not have the \"wow\" factor present in other hotels",
        "Sure, food is expensive, but you expect that at such a hotel",
        "Most restaurants in Tanjung Benoa and Bualu offer free transport to hotels, so there is a pretty good range of places to eat away from the hotel (recommend Bumbu Bali, Jalan Pratama, Tanjung Benoa)",
        "During my stay in Bali, I spent 5 nights at Nusa Dua and several nights at other hotels in Bali",
        "However, the hotel did not even compare to the more traditional hotels where I stayed, including Tandjung Sari in Sanur",

        "As far as the leading hotels of the world tag goes, I am not quite sure what this means and who awards it, but if you take it literally you may be disappointed, a discerning traveler, used to staying at the worlds finest, will probably find that this does not quite compare",
        "This was the first stop on our honeymoon trip (for 5 nights), this hotel is accredited in the 'best hotels in the world' programme and, having travelled extensively in recent years we can say with confidence it is exactly that! The room we had was huge, well furnished with a modern balianese feel, the bed was really comfortable and the balcony looked over the sea",

        "We recently spent 2 nights at this hotel (Feb07) and we loved every minute of it",
        "The happy hour (6-8) is best described as a social adjustment hour; excellent in every way",
        "We were there for 10 days and really loved it",
        "But, you're going to Bali, aren't you? Some of the others could be Tokyo or some generic beach resort",

        "This is my second time staying, but I would recommend some music around The pool",
        "We had a few evening meals in the resort however we had a bad experience on every occasion which was probably \"the luck of the draw\" but these experiences didn't fill us with confidence for eating in the resort",
        "Its family friendly although there were only a small number of children at the resort so it was generally quiet especially when compared to some of the other Nusa Dua hotels that are not !",
        "At the time of our visit a lot of daytime construction work spoiled the quiet surroundings as the resort is building a new beach restaurant \"Tamarind\" which looks like it should be open in August - the noise was a bit of a nuisance but we feel sure once this is complete the bar and beach area will be excellent",
        "Nusa Dua Beach Resort had a competitive price",
        "Love Bali love this resort hotel",
        "The resort exceeded our expectations",
        "Kids loved the pool and surrounds",

        "Would definately recommend this resort",
        "A quiet, peaceful resort that has you whispering on occasions, the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is the perfect place in Bali to relax",
        "Everything is on hand - there's a huge buffet breakfast in the mornings, a nice selection of restaurants and bars in the evenings, and in between there's a good pool and beach to sit by and soak up the sun",
        "Some of the other hotels are more luxurious but we liked the atmosphere, staff and overall beauty of this resort",
        "There is up to 2m tidal range on the beach making it pretty much unswimmable 2-3 hours either side of low water",
        "We had an amazing time at the resort, we explored a lot of Bali, but on some days couldn't wait to get back to the resort to relax",
        "Overall a great stay- but just some room to improve upon would be - the rather old sunbeds compared to nearby resorts and clearing of floating seaweeds and washed up trash near the pier (which seems to be a common issue in the area)",
        "Pools were lovely, clean and well serviced and supporting staff great",
        "Absolutely beautiful resort with unimaginable Opulance in all its marble and gold features many beautiful eateries, entertainment and pools with beach across footpath",

        "Thank you to the resort and Luxury Escapes",
        "If you really wanted to find a reason to complain about something you could find a few little problems but this resort is overall great value for money and the staff are very friendly, efficient and want to make your stay as good as they can for everyone",
        "A few more chairs under the trees would help as well as not everyone needs to be right next to the pools",
        "This resort retains a lot of Balinese heritage and charm compared to many of the newer more \"Americanised\" venues that surround it so it depends on what you are looking for on your holiday as to weather this is the place for you or not but we think things like the large Lizards wandering around the dining area, squirrels on the room balconies and the wonderful local staff make this hotel our first choice when we return",
        "Resort is ok but not 5 star or worth the money",
        "We have been to Bali over 10 times and there are much better resorts in Nusa Dua or Kuta side",
        "We had fresher pastries, juices etc and different variety each day a a smaller resort in Kuta earlier in the week",
        "From the moment we checked in until our unfortunate departure, we could not have been more impressed nor had a more enjoyable stay at this resort",
        "There are plenty of facilities to utilise within the resort to keep yourself entertained",
        "There are some new facilities under construction so this resort will only get better!",
        "Buffet breakfast was the best and swimming pools were great! Only one thing, the service waiters around the pool areas could have been increased as sometimes it took a long time to flag one down, hotel would also make more money with more drinks sold so this should be a no brainier! Overall very happy and would return!",
        "The facilities were fabulous - the gym, pool, and tennis and squash courts - awesome!",
        "Have been going to BALI for the last twenty years and this is my fourth stay at this wonderful resort as me and my wife regard this as the best resort in BALI not only for couples but also for families , When the new restaurant at the beach front and new pool on the other side of resort are finished this will only add to the experience also notice the outside WIFI antennas being installed and must mention all the lovely staff ,thanks again for a great holiday",
        "without forgetting the kindness of the staff around the pools, always happy to help",
        "Our room was so very far away from the pool which was a shame",
        "like Westin Resort next door?? Your staff were excellent but please take 'movie time' off your list",
        "Pool amazing",
        "We stayed in a Premier room in the west Agung Garden wing of the hotel, overlooking the garden and small lake- it was truly a joy to awake to the sounds and sights of tropical birds, cheeky squirrels, other wildlife and the fountain in the lake",
        "We will be back, we loved this resort it was just beautiful safe & the gardens we just beautiful",
        "Overall, stay was good, pools are big enough, so you won't feel too crowded, but not enough beach chairs though",
        "The kids loved the pool and the service was above and beyond! We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay and would highly recommend",
        "Breakfast cannot be faulted and over all the Pool and Pool area are excellent",
        "prepare to 'relax' by the pool listening to hammers, saws, etc",
        "The Construction Work really did ruin the ambience and relaxed environment - who wants to listen to that every day by the pool !?",
        "The tiles around the pool are too slippery",
        "The resort was fantastic",
        "I came here expecting an amazing resort but unfortunately it didn't meet those needs! There was No pool lounges free for use as there are limited lounges for amount of guests so everytime we went to pool instead of being able to lounge around there were no beds free",
        "I feel the landscaping has a lot to be desired and areas around pool just don't feel as presented as other places I have stayed",
        "Large resort, maybe a little too large as it had a feel of a European all inclusive with out the free beer and ice creams",
        "To a construction site and the A/C was leaking water",
        "We found the resort and the Luxury escape package exceeded our expectations for both quality and value",
        "The only issue we had was that there were some inconsistencies with the knowledge about the package and its benefits between different staff/ venues around the resort",
        "so enjoyed most of our days on the beach and in the water",
        "The lap pool was my favourite - just lie there for hours together with a good book under the tree",
        "Chairs around large pool seemed to be occupied as towels were left behind but it seems that the people were not returning to them",
        "BUT, I also have to say that this resort has one of the best customer relation services I've seen",
        "Overall, the resort grows on us more and more every day, and we now look forward to returning here",
        "The resort would provide a wonderful tourist destination for individuals, families and friends",
        "The beach was very pretty and the water was pretty clean, a little garbage, but not excessive",
        "Nice swinmming pool and large beach",
        "As beautiful as the resort is it is in need of an update",
        "- For our 2 night stay, we did not leave the resort",
        "Kids were very happy with the pools",
        "The resort has beautiful grounds, fantastic pools catering for both adults and kids, spacious rooms and an awesome spa!!!! ( definitely the best part!!) The staff at the spa were especially attentive and the treatments I received were fantastic",
        "Other negatives was the works going on right next to the pool, that we had to call housekeeping on 5 occasions to replenish our coffee and tea after the room had been serviced, the drinks were expensive and lastly that there is no laundry facilities to do your own laundry, which is difficult with kids",
        "This was our 7th visit to this authentic balianise type resort",
        "Nice resort and is in a good location in Nusa Dua",
        "Beautiful resort with lots of character",
        "To sit by the pool listening to drills and work 10-20 foot away, very unenjoyable",
        "My towel rail fell off in my room, I didnt have hot water in my room, and I could not open the bottled water due to a broken bottle opener",
        "The children's pool was fantastic and was under shade for most of the day",
        "The setting and gardens are wonderful and the pools are excellent",
        "The pools are fine, we had a large group of fat, loud Australians sitting in the pool drinking when we first arrived, this spoiled the atmosphere when you are trying to relax",
        "We found the spa pool much nicer however the water was quite cool",
        "I was very worried about coming to Bali, but after arriving at your resort, I felt totally at ease",
        "Your staff are wonderful and the whole resort is fabulous",
        "I love the food, gardens and bar in pool",
        "With much appreciation Niall Forde",
        "Everywhere we went, we were bothered with loud noise of grinding stone from construction, they were by the pool as well as the beach",
        "The only gripe I've got is small children being aloud to swim in the main pool, They have 3 other options to choose from",
        "There is, however, A very nice pool within view of the water",
        "For racquets, but we couldn't use the resort credit we were given",
        "The resort credit was $10 U",
        "The pool is the stand out feature",

        "A tip, watch the tide, low tide not suitable for water sports",

        "The resort provided a great selection of scheduled daily activities that everyone could participate in",
        "Resort grounds were beautifully maintained",
        "Having two main pools was good as the swimming pool by the beach could get a bit crowded at times",

        "* A service fee is attributed to all purchases at the resort",

        "In the end, we walked to local restaurants outside the resort where there were more and cheaper options",
        "Just spent 9 days here and after scoping the local area we are very happy with our choice of resort",
        "Nice and peaceful away from the pool scene, tranquil view of ponds and geese, lots of trees",
        "This is the oldest resort in Nusa Dua so a few cracks are showing in the old girl but more than made up for by traditional finishes and features - totally charming",

        "Will definitely recommend your resort to family and friends",
        "From the moment you drive into the resort you feel impressed",
        "The two pools were great, although we struggled with the temperature, it was quite warm; but this was the same issue with our previous accommodation in Legian, so we assumed it was due to the warm/humid weather!",
        "The trip out there, back & the meal in Kuta cost us less than the meal at the resort",
        "a little salty but typical resort prices",
        "the beach was average and pool was nice",
        "The only real issue we had was that the pool is too hot",
        "The temperature in March/April and the encompassing humidity you really need a pool which should refresh you and we found that this did not happen",

        "Fantastic facilities,awesome lap pool and gym",
        "While the hotel is starting to show it's age in some respects it was still a fantastic experience and we would highly recommend this resort",

        "We love it here and highly recommend Nusa Dua Resort to anyone who needs a break away",
        "This resort is one of the first established but still holds its own in both facilities and definitely price compared to some of its rich cousins along the famous Nusa Dua 'millionaires row'",
        "The rooms are well appointed and comfortable and we would recommend getting one overlooking the pool/beach area as this is the heart of the resort",
        "that's the beauty of this resort",
        "Only complaint we would have is that the pool is a bit warm , but that's out of their hands",

        "we stayed for six nights at the end of January in two adjoining rooms , not overly spacious but had enough storage and bathrooms great, pools are lovely with plenty of space and sunbeds ,Breakfast is great with good selection but other restaurants a bit of a disappointment with not a great choice and average quality for the cost, we used the gym and the spa pool also the early morning yoga which was a great experience, Wifi was good around the hotel",

        "the pool was nice but very crowed as its a very big hotel, we couldn't find much shade around the pool",

        "The resort, yes the resort was built in 1983 and it is showing its age with the stone work and pool tiles etc - some pool tiles in the \"kids\" pool were coming off and in fact I picked one up off the floor of the pool",
        "The kids pool is also good for adults and its nice and shady and also deep",
        "The main pool is fantastic, very deep - for a change:))",

        "I make special mention of the pool bar attendant, Mr",
        "To us it was NOT an upgrade as we did not have the pool view only garden and we were not interested in using club facilities as we wanted to be with our friends for breakfast and evening cocktails not stuck in a room without them",
        "They did not charge us for the pool view room which was fair however it took many phone calls to get to this point as they did not understand that, to us, it was not an upgrade and we were not paying for something we did not get",

        "The rooms are looking a tad tired and definitely some new lounges around the pool would improve this resort even more",
        "In theory this is a lovely idea but for us personally, in all the times I have stayed at NDBH the manager has never come over to introduce himself which I found a little odd as we stayed over 10 times at this resort",
        "The Palace Club Ocean View room only has glimpses of the ocean but the room had a separate living and dinning area as well as 2 toilets and a kitchen/storage area and a lovely big long balcony looking over the pond, very nice",

        "I will suggest the hotel to put additional sunbeds, shades and parasols around the pool as it seem to never be enough for all guests",
        "Also was quite disappointing that smoking was permitted in the pool area where many kids played around",

        "We had a direct access to the beach and were 20 meters from the main pool",
        "During low tides, we would move to one of the main swimming pools, which were always clean and never overcrowded (we stayed 2_9 November, this is also maybe the reason)",

        "The rooms are spacious, the staff are wonderful, the breakfast is great and the lagoon pool is ideal for people travelling with children",
        "Pools good, beach breathtaking, but beware the hawkers! Had a personal guide who drove us around the islands best bits",
        "Bottom line is it's an amazing resort if you want to unwind and be spoilt by the staff who are very eager to always please,and that sort of summed up my vacation",
        "A few upgrades needed here and there but I wouldn't fault this resort too much",
        "The massages were wonderful and the pools and the grounds overall were beautiful",

        "This resort and location is ideally suited to the more mature traveller and requires a taxi trip to reach shopping strips or nightclubs",
        "Just a little South of the Melia resort is a side street with a small strip of local traders with everything from drinks, to cheap eats and clothing",
        "A longer though very enjoyable walk to the entry of the resort precinct gives you access to convenience and clothing stores as well as several restaurants and bars",
        "My husband and I together with our very good friends are just back from 10 nights holidaying at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort",

        "Rooms very tired - I couldn't give the resort overall any more than 4*",

        "This hotel is everything you would expect from a 5 star resort",
        "Staff are all fantastic every one from concierge to cleaners are friendly, food is very good at the restaurants - I especially liked the italian - and breakfast buffet is extensive, hotel grounds and the beach are beautiful and pools are clean",
        "This was our first visit at this resort, my wife and travel to Bali annually, and stay at 2 different resort which we had inspected the previous year",
        "This resort far exceeded our expectations, very balinese in its character and atmostphere",
        "If you can leave the pools and fancy the beach the shelter from the beach trees is perfect",
        "If you are looking for a resort which has lovely staff, nice pools, good food, and sporting activities all on one site, then this is for you",
        "Swimming pools, playground and the beach are absolutely fantastic",
        "Perfect for what we wanted as it was away from the busy parts of bali and we could basically stay at the resort the whole week",
        "Its better to walk out a bit from the resort and catch a blue bird taxi from there which is on a meter and a lot cheaper",

        "i've been staying at many resort in nusa dua area, such as hyatt, laguna, grand nikko, ayodya",

        "The kids club was ok, but the kids didn't really seem to want to go back like in other resorts, it's an area that could be improved",
        "If only all of the staff were as well versed in English this resort would be a true winner",
        "It makes for a deeper knowledge of the local area or activities in the resort very challenging",
        "Overall the resort Has traditional bali charm but needs a small amount of work to bring it back to life, the food is hit(Japanese restaurant) and miss (checkers by the oceanfront)",
        "A coke from the street was 70c, at the resort it was $4",
        "It takes the gloss off an overall charming resort",
        "over $4 for a bottle of water by the pool",
        "Only feedback would be that the pools should remain open longer (to 9pm perhaps?)",
        "Great customer service, close enough to go to Seminyak using toll road 17mins approx, however you may consider this an inconvenience it's only a small fair to pay while staying in this beautiful resort ($10-$14)",

        "We visited the resort in October 2013",
        "Of our 5 day holiday, we spent 4 days entirely in the resort",
        "Whilst not the most contemporary or trendy resort in Nusa Dua, this hotel more than makes up for it with its lush gardens, beautiful pools, proximity to the beach and friendly helpful staff",
        "We have been in your resort many times and have always been happy but this time we found not proper service and poor quality for restaurants meals",
        "Aside from this the facilities are very good, the kids club is tiny with quite boring and limited activities and from looking at nearby hotels their clubs seems much bigger and more fun, but the pool area was fantastic with a huge sandbank area for kids to play in and plenty of communal toys provided for kids of all ages",
        "Even though it was a resort, I found the prices to be a little high on most food and beverage for my liking",
        "The pool areas were great",
        "The pool is just few meters away from the beach ( in other hotels pool is not so close)",
        "The second pool is PERFECT for the whole family to enjoy, specially if you have small kids",
        "Whether lazing by the lagoon pool or sipping a cocktail on the beach in the natural shade of trees overlooking the Indian Ocean or having a Balinese massage at the spa this hotel has a long list of indulgences that will take you to a level of relaxation that will make you feel like you have been on holidays forever!!!",

        "Overall I don't have a bad word to say about the resort, it is a perfect escape for couples or families",
        "hotel is located on a lovely beach which is kept clean by hotel staff, the other thing is your trapped in the resort unless you order a taxi to take you into town, if you want peace and quite and happy to lie around the pool all day than this place is fine",
        "excellent place to recharge the batteries in style and enjoy the culture and relaxed atmosphere of an excellent resort",
        "This was one of our best holidays ever, great resort",
        "Loved the pool areas, spa treatments, amazing gardens and very helpful friendly staff",
        "Further more, staying in nusa dua is synonymous with \"filthy rich\" so they charge you triple the price to get a ride into civilisation, and try to discourage you from using a meter taxi (so that you don't find out what it ACTULALLY would cost to get to seminyak, for example, where you will pay only $8 for a delicious meal, compared to $25 for an edible meal, at best, at the resort)",
        "Ps, the pool was amazing",
        "I returned to Australia today after nine nights at this resort",
        "All explained several times but they only do as instrucred, no common sense is allowed",

        "It's like chalk and cheese - by far this 5***** resort has exceeded our expectations in all areas",
        "06:00 down to the 50m lap pool at the Spa for 20 laps - for the whole 8 days I was the only silly bugger up at that hour and had the pool to myself",

        "Kids loved the pools and kids club",

        "I can appreciate this resort would also be perfect for those who are after a much more relaxed holiday than what we had",
        "The pool and beach were very popular with couples and families alike",
        "Only downside (for a 5-star resort) is that the rooms are relatively small",
        "One small niggle was the daily scramble for pool or beach loungers - often arriving after a leisurely breakfast to find virtually all of them reserved with towels but not being used - not what is expected of a 5 start property - management needs to sort it out",
        "We had a very restful time at the resort, it has the most beautiful grounds",
        "Shallow water due to tide",
        "Built around 1983 it's becomming a little jayed but if you want a resort style getaway it is all that you need",

        "Pool was way too warm but water activities were awesome",
        "Our only problems were our airport transfer did not arrive and we had to make our own way to the hotel and the pools are lovely but because people put their towels out on the chairs really early in the morning and reserve them for the day, its impossible to get a chair after about 8",
        "The pool could be empty and you still can't get a chair as people leave their things there and then just come and go thru the day as they please",
        "A lot of frustrated guests around the pool area",
        "return again pool bar the food was excellent breckfasts wher also excellent",

        "Absolutely beautiful resort, great room and wonderful staff",
        "The hotel amenities itself (pool, garden, spa) is also great",
        "We also managed to visit Ayana and if Ayana in Jimbaran Bay is a five star resort, then Nusa Dua Beach hotel is a 3 star at best!",
        "A suggestion for improvement would be to have a system allocating pool beds to everyone as it is a little annoying when people leave their towels to reserve pool beds from early morning until sunset",
        "A peaceful retreat in busy Bali",
        "Still the best resort we have found in all Asia",
        "The pools and other recreational facilities were all first class",
        "Nusa Dua has all these hotels by the beach and be rest assured you will not be required to step outside your hotel other than to jump into the water",
        "The rooms are lovely the pool is the centre of attraction with activity (read bar) next to it",
        "The lagoon pool can be used until (I guess it was 10), the other, bigger one only until 7pm",

        "My biggest complaint was that we were located on the opposite side of the resort from our daughter and her family",
        "Amazing highlight",
        "Inadequate loungers around the pools meant that we often had to find somewhere else to hang out",
        "Whilst being a modern 5 star resort",
        "The pool areas are well maintained",
        "The hotel has 2 large pools and a few smaller ones",

        "i particulary enoyed the large pool to thoug access to the very beautiful beach is just as conveniet",
        "Pool was always clean but wish there was more lunge chairs",
        "you need to get up around the start of breakfast or when the pool management team come out, to \"reserve\" a spot at the main pool, or else fear the wrath of little kids in the other pools",
        "Rooms a bit aged but resort is beautiful",
        "Pool was nice",
        "We had a wonderful eight night holiday in this lovely resort",
        "Resort facilities were elegant yet relaxed",
        "The bad was the service, the staff didn't really speak English, you had to pay for the internet in your room (and was flakey in the public areas), the stock in the room was at a minimum (running out of toilet paper constantly) and the walk ways around the pool were very slippery and dangerous",
        "Just spent a week at nusa dua beach resort and spa",
        "Great hotel in terms of facilities, rooms, pool and restaurants",
        "If a big resort is what you are after then it's a good choice",

        "Lovely pools",
        "We've just spent 7 glorious days at this resort in fabulous Bali weather",

        "We went there as a family with an 11, 16 and 18 year old and they all had a ball in the pool and beach",
        "The many resuaturants inside the resort also catered for Coeliacs which is surprising, just triple check with the head chef as their understanding of gluten is limited",
        "The resorts main pool is small in comparison to other resorts which have mutliple pools, but nevertheless suitable",
        "Overall we all had a great timeand I particularly enjoyed feeding the fish and turtles in the resort foyer pond",
        "The resort is perfectly fine if you are expecting the usual Bali fare; but definitely NOT a 4 and a half star experience",
        "It's a beautiful resort with good atmosphere and services",
        "However, we asked for and were granted a room change because the bathroom of the first room allocated to us was quite unsatisfactory --- small, no bath tub, shower with only a half door so the water would just splash all over the floor and the unhygienic situation of the toilet being in close proximity to the wash basin and towels",
        "For a hotel that was the first of its kind in Nusa Dua it is a beautiful resort with wonderful staff & attention to detail",
        "We went to the playground at the resort every day",
        "They drove us there ( soooo quick with the new toll bridge ) and just waited till we wanted to go somewhere else or go back to the hotel",
        "Or indeed all guests trying to use the pool facilities",
        "The main pool, with its swim up bar, got plenty of use, and there is another 'lagoon' pool which is shallow enough for kids of all ages",
        "The hotel also offers guests free daytime activities - we actually really enjoyed carving flowers and leaves out of vegetables, and the trial scuba dive in the pool an interesting experience",
        "Would recommend this resort without hesitation",
        "Beach and pool areas were clean and relaxing with all the facilities of a top resort",
        "We had a fabulous holiday at this resort",

        "The resort is five star and has great pools private beach with lay chairs big foyer freindly staff free breakfast great variety and security front and rear",
        "Was expecting to have water sports available to use, so was a little disappointed at this aspect",
        "One remark, given the size this resort is more suitable for families and children then couples",
        "Other than that a nice allround resort",
        "The resort is rustic in line with Balinese culture",
        "Kid friendly with appropriate pools",
        "For a comparatively inexpensive Nusa Dua resort this hotel really delivers",
        "Lovely resort with great pools, spa facilities and great location",

        "We recently spent 5 nights at the Resort",
        "Our son had their wedding at the Resort which was beautifully organised",
        "pools and sports facilities, table tennis, tennis, gym just great",
        "Our first neighbours liked to watch TV until late and again from about 5 am, which was annoying as it was clearly audible in our room, however, this is no fault of the resort and they checked out after two days before I bothered to comment, so meh",
        "Walking the beach front in both directions you'll notice the newer, 'western' 5 star places are cold and sterile by comparison and lack the tradition, warmth and character that abounds at this resort",
        "5 to 5 start luxury in what is sadly a gated community bereft of Balinese culture save for this authentic resort",
        "commend the Resort in general",
        "And more seats around the pool",
        "Limited seating at pool area which had to spend time to locate",
        "It can get very busy by the two big pools at the front of the resort",
        "Lots of spare pool lounges - children under 12 not allowed in this area",
        "If you are looking for a relaxing hotel with a great beach, nice pools, superb staff and a beautiful setting this hotel is certainly worth considering",
        "A few of the nights we actually headed to the local shopping centre (there is a shuttle bus which goes from the hotel) which had a great variety of restaurants, which were better priced and also got us out of the resort as the resort was very quiet at night",
        "one small issue with the reservation on seats on the pool",
        "There is also the Nusa Dua Village which is approximately 20 minutes walk out of the resort (or a AU$2",
        "Excellent pools with beach access",
        "If there is an outdoor jacuzzi next to the pool, it would be perfect for adult over seeing their kids at the pools",
        "great authentic feel to this resort",
        "It's a great place for families or couples, the resort is kept immaculate and there are plenty of restuarants/bars",
        "The pools are great",
        "The highlight of our hotel? The squirrels, so cute and if you're quiet and gentle, they'll feed from your hand! We are already planning our return",
        "We were in a suite away from the pool which we loved as it was peaceful",
        "Some people prefer being close to the pool but it depends on your preference",
        "To get a pool side seat under an umbrella you need to be there early though",
        "My wife and two young daughters enjoyed many of the resort facilities and had a great time doing so",
        "Every aspect of the resort was fantastic",
        "Honestly cannot fault this resort",

        "A fantastic resort for families and couples, not for singles",
        "The NDBHS was pretty standard for a Nusa Dua resort, very extensive grounds with lots of facilities, a little bit worn, belying the age of the place",
        "On the downside, the pool area is showing its age - which is about 40 years iirc",
        "It could well do with a renovation to give it a bit more shine; and compared to its neighbours, the water area is quite small (though the main pool is nice and deep)",

        "This resort is beautiful",
        "There is a beautiful lake in the middle of the grounds with ducks, lizards, turtles and a white heron",
        "Very picturesque, but a warning to parents of small children, it is still a body of unfenced water!",
        "The only complaint we had about this resort is that it is very singular",
        "One notable aspect of the resort we particularly liked, was that the hotel never felt crowded",
        "We found the pools, grounds and beach to be very clean, and the sea water pleasant and crystal clear at this time of the year",

        "I would absolutely recommend Nusa Dua Resort & Spa but would like to note that it is pricey considering you are in Bali",
        "Very good facilities for wheelchair bound people as plenty of ramps the only problem we could sewas access to the pool as the steps are rather deep",
        "\"Where Kings and Presidents stay\" truly indicates the high quality of this resort",

        "Also, once you get to Nusa Dua there's not much to do except be in the resort",

        "Comparing to the rest of South Kuta, you do feel like you are out of no where, but for family holidays and novice travelers to Bali or South East Asia, it is perfect, the resort has almost everything one needs and it's in a safe and well manicured (but man made) part of Bali",

        "A big luxurious resort complex which offers everything that you expect from a 5 star establishment - no complaint at all! The Deluxe rooms were a bit small and worn-out, although the website claims that they were recently refurbished (a bit hard to believe, if you ask me)",

        "There are 4 pools, 2 specifically for kids and the lagoon pool with its sand beach is very nice but too many kids for me so we spent all our time in the large main pool",

        "We had a beautiful corner Suite, on the 1st Floor, overlooking the pools & beach, we could have gone for a grand, ground floor Suite with it's own splash pool on the patio, which looked great, but we were very pleased with our choice of Suite, due to the view, which the ground floor one didn't have, as it had a wall around the splash pool",
        "At first, i had doubt that the resort would be a pleasant one due to its 30 years old age, so I kept my expectation low",
        "However, when i first reached the resort, i was impressed that the resort was well maintained",
        "Even though not as impressive as other resort in the same area but was nice",
        "This resort was located in Nusa Dua which is my favourite spot in Bali",
        "My daughter liked the sandy pool so much",
        "Considering the rate that we got (was a good deal comparing to its neighbours), I would think this resort was excellent",
        "I would highly recommend this resort to everyone",
        "They have 3 kind of pool",
        "The grounds and the lobby are spectacular and have many places to sit and lounge around the pool and beach",
        "Large grassy area next to the beach provide a choice to lay in the shade under the palm trees and still be steps to the water",
        "If you don't have a room facing the interior pool area the view is uninspiring and the generator from the adjacent resort make sitting on the balcony unpleasant due to the loud hum coming from the generator",
        "Just sit next to the pool and beach (don't expect spectacular sunsets on this side of the island though!) and read",
        "In this day and age it's unforgivable for a resort of this class not to provide such a basic service",
        "there are lot of activities which you can do here like water sports, spa, cycle rides that time flies like anything",
        "The best thing about staying in this resort area within Nusa Dua is the peace and quiet compared to Kuta/Legian",
        "Right on the beach and perfect rooms, spotlessly clean, large in size and many different facilities at the resort",
        "Great pools",
        "The grounds were beautiful and well maintained and the pool and the beach are clean and quite",
        "It's a large resort so you offer feel like you are alone",
        "This hotel is right next to the westin hotel",
        "The resort is indeed a beautiful, 5-star hotel with very friendly Balinese employees, an activity desk, on the beach, an open air design, with an adequate gym and three pools, including a lap pool",
        "1) The resort is very isolated in its own area with security checkpoints to enter the area and to enter the hotel grounds",
        "my kids really like the pool and the beach so clean and the breakfast also yummy",
        "The facilities at this hotel are fantastic, particularly with the pool in the spa area being a quiet zone where kids are not allowed",
        "To praise the environment, the Balinese architecture of the hotel lobby, restaurants, rooms and overall garden & pool & beach landscape would mean bringing coals to Newcastle",
        "The hotel is very cozy and locates beside Westin hotel",
        "The breakfast was good and the swimming pool was also good",
        "Good hotel, with an outstanding beachfront and great pools",
        "The resort has spectacular gardens and fountains",
        "The pools are good, however the sun lounges are quite dated old plastic ones and look due for replacement",
        "would recommend this resort and the palace club rooms",
        "This is our second trip to Bali,My husband, myself and 3 boys,We had a great time relaxing in the serenity of the resort,It offers the total feel of walking into comfort fresh open lobbies and",
        "Just arrived home after a great week at this resort",
        "I have been very fortunate to have been to this resort a few times, and I still love it",
        "We stayed in the palace club suite which is gorgeous, but the whole resort is outstanding",
        "There are so many resorts in nusa dua but this stands out because it looks more Balinese and its not full off kids",
        "Overall this resort is almost faultless",
        "( this would be our 54th trip to Bali so I have been to many resorts)",
        "We requested the same rooms as our previous visit which overlooked the pool and beach",
        "The pools are large and there are a number of options",
        "The resort provides transportation to and from the local area and always readily available when required",
        "The resort is nestled between many other 5 star resorts which we visited when we wanted more variety",
        "Find the large lap pool at the back of the Spa area near the tennis courts - no kids under 12 allowed and basically the pool area is empty 90% of the time",
        "This is a very nice Hotel, less busy than many in the Nusa Dua Resort Area and is very reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel",
        "Two large pools, beachfront and a wide range of Restaurants on the premises and nearby",
        "This resort has the total package for the most relaxing holiday , palace club facilities our out standing if you haven't tried it do it ,such a friendly and welcoming management chefs and staff",
        "Pool is awesome especially Kid's pool",
        "We enjoyed a dip in the spa's private pool (which stays open till 10:00pm!), the atmosphere was calm and serene",
        "The pool was great but do not recommend swimming in the ocean",
        "Note though that this is a resort and not near any real shopping or dining accomodations outside of the complex",
        "My partner and I stayed at this beautiful resort from 7 to 16 June 2013",
        "This resort definately has the WOW factor",
        "Checkin was speedy and was given lots of information about the resort",
        "There is a good Kids Club at the Resort",
        "Pools",
        "There are two huge pools, especially designed for families and young children in mind",
        "The Resort: Absolutely beautiful - breathtaking",
        "If you want to use it in your room or around the resort, you have to pay for it",
        "We felt for a 5 star hotel and the $10 million dollar or so upgrade, that surely Wi-Fi, should be FREE throughout the Resort",
        "That is my only negative thing about the resort",
        "We would highly recommend this resort",
        "The hotel is a great balance of resort retreat and family friendly",
        "pool was warm and huge",
        "Avoid walking to the old resort after dark",
        "Had a lovely stay in this beautiful resort with 3 friends in a room for 4 people which is basically 2 adjoining rooms but much better value than booking 2 separate rooms",
        "Beautiful grounds, pool, beach and great buffet breakfast too",
        "there are some great pools and the children's pool was our favourite as our son could play in it safely",

        "The swimming pools are quite large and clean",
        "The pool staff were very good and worked very hard , in fact the hotel could probably do with a few more staff at the pool area",
        "The are 2 pools to choose from and one in particular suits the children perfectly",
        "We booked this hotel for 9 days and had the most wonderful time, by the pool and beach",
        "The resort is beautiful but lacks the quality, amenities & feeling of a 5star! The first night did not make a good impression but was certainly a lasting one!!! Chose to have the seafood buffet for dinner - found the food to be overpriced & terrible! The fire dancing was really nice but you can't eat that!!! The first room given to us had a drainage problem that resulted in a foul odor every time the tap was opened",
        "Great main pool and surrounding pools",
        "The hotel is large and well set out with many rooms having great views of the pool, beautifully lush gardens and beach",
        "very bad - pool closes at 7 pm",
        "even though nice idea to have Kuta/Lombok sand in entrance of swimming pool",
        "Very few families with children and not the 'mass resort' that I feared from some reviews",
        "the hotel gives u a VACATION and resort feel",
        "best seating is near the small pond wherein i happily fed the fishes with croissants :)",
        "Best thing we enjoyed was the uncrowded swimming pools - my toddler had great fun waddling around in the pool",
        "The compliment water was not enough for three of us and the price of mini bar water was extremely high for Bali",
        "In the morning the cleaning staff come at 9 o'clock with a several bell rings which seems very inappropriate for me for a holiday resort! Another problem with our sleep was the noise",
        "Hotel grounds, pool, and beach area very relaxing",
        "The resort is very good and beautiful",
        "Well mantained with an absolutely awesome pool",
        "The resort is so beautiful! It is a pretty big place and we visited in low season (April) so there wasnt that many people there, i guess it would be a different experience if the resort was fully booked",
        "the rooms are also much bigger and are situated at the most beautiful pond with ducks swimming around (in the morning they come up to the palace club to demand breakfast each day around 10 o clock, it is so cute!",
        "We stayed here for 4 days in April, and I have to say it is an amazing resort",
        "The pool is gorgeous with lotsa of deck chairs and shade",
        "however, All in all this is excellent resort, perfect for relaxing and rejuvenating the soul",
        "Would definitely recommend this resort to family and friends and will be back soon!",
        "As a hotel guest, my only suggestion would be to ask for a room that doesn't face the construction (looks like a new resort being built)",
        "For the hotel, my one suggestion would be to offer free water with purchased meals",
        "Every single detail in the hotel is nice starting from the Lobby to the rooms, restaurants, pool, garden,",
        "We were surprised upon our arrival at the hotel, it is really big and it took us few hours to explore the resort",
        "Breakfast - there are varieties and good food, we enjoyed our breakfast everyday by the pond",
        "The attention to detail is extraordinary throughout the whole resort",
        "I loved laying out by the pool and the beach, the hotel provides beach chairs and umbrellas (subject to availability) at no charge",
        "10/ 10 ponts",
        "The paving around the pool were in some places very uneven and slippery one guest stubbed his toe quite badly on both toes",
        "The PH of the pool was not up to standard and you could feel the water was slimy and looked cloudy",
        "Four people we know of were treated for ear infections at the hospital and it wasn't till complaints were made that the pool was improved",
        "Needless to say we will not be returning to this resort or recommending it to any friends",
        "The pools are clean and at a very refreshing temperature",
        "Stunning location and was great to chill out by the pool",
        "i believe this resort is 30 years old but they have gone to great lengths to keep the resort from looking dated",
        "this resort is truly accessible was there supporting my friend who is in a wheelchair",
        "The resort was a little dated, but was good",
        "Great resort for couples and families",
        "We particularly enjoyed the pool and pool bar",
        "Bartender at the pool was great",
        "Sure there are cheaper places outside of the resort area for drinks and spa treatments but when on vacation at a resort like this, everything you need is right there",
        "We never went without water in our rooms",
        "Restaurants were all great, loved the whole duck at Rajas",
        "Pool area is really lovely",
        "The room was clean and nice, the pool was also fabulous",
        "The lap pool, saunas and cold water pool is great! There is also a bar where you can get light lunch and delicious non-alcoholic drinks",
        "The pools are nice, but the pools in neighbouring more upmarket hotels seemed more interesting",
        "In Nusa Dua, all the resorts are next to each other, so you can do a hotel/pool-crawl which we did one day :) Besides that, the Nusa Dua area is good because it's separated from the rest of Bali, but also bad because it's further to get to Seminyak/Kuta area (traffic was really congested when we were there, especially due to the tunnel works? near Kuta)",
        "This resort is advertised as 5 star but we found it lacking",
        "The resort does a very good job at hiding its age (30 this year) and has many restaurants, a few pools, a tennis court, a gym and a spa",
        "Pool area is nice although a little crowded due to the holiday period",
        "Everyone seems to head to the pool area & puts their belongings on sun lounges to reserve them, then goes off to breakfast/activities & some return to pool hours later",
        "We even saw a pool attendant reserving 2 lounges for someone!",
        "The areas around the pools were not cleaned regularly, a straw and a slice of lemon that feel onto the floor from my drink on the first afternoon was still there the following two days! Next tim,e I will go back to the Laguna or the Westin",
        "Nusa Dua hotel is huge consisting of 3 pools, 5 restaurants & 2 bars",
        "The pool area gets packed quickly, so getting there early is a good tip, while the afternoon seems to fizzle out, more pool chairs become available",
        "The pools are clean & huge, the waters are warm & delightful",
        "The beach is a few steps away from the pool,which makes access easy, the shallow waters are clear & calm",
        "The grounds were stunning, the pools clean and inviting and the service exceptional! The room was large and comfortable but very light, early in the morning",
        "I would recommend that people watch the fruit carving demonstration by the pool, go for a morning bike ride with a hotel staff member, play squash, tennis etc",
        "Excelent pool, beach is quiet and nice",
        "we had stayed from feb 7 to 11, felt it was quite less, you need at least 7 days out of which at least 2 full days in this beautiful resort",
        "One of the families we met there in the pool travelled to value regularly (they were from Perth, so very easy access with quick short flits) and they had stayed in a number of hotels with their young children and felt this was the best due to the pools - they are by kid friendly with a little sandy beach sloping gently into the water",
        "The rooms are comfortable (premier room may be a touch bigger than deluxe), pools are excellent (esp",
        "the lap pool which was great for laps as well as relaxing - very few people), spa treatments beautiful",
        "I believe this hotel was the first hotel in Nusa Dua, an enclave of exclusive resorts",
        "A very nice getaway for 2 nights, we really enjoyed our stay at this resort",
        "We swam in the pool in the rain because it was still hot",
        "The pools were big, the beach private, and because it was off-peak season, there were lots of space for everyone",
        "There were three pools, one that had volleyball and beach feel for kids, and another with a swim up bar and the third in the spa area which was a quiet area with no kids",
        "The owners of the resort are some middle eastern investment arms of an oil rich state in the middle east, and they have recently injected funds to re-do the resort",
        "Rooms are large, clean, well thought out, with all the usual amenities of a 5 star resort",
        "whole family was in love with the resort and we did not want to leave",
        "I think being so relaxed in this beautiful hotel resort made it so easy to sleep",
        "The grounds are beautiful and the pools are huge",
        "The hotels decor and grounds were absolutely pristine and many relaxing hours were spent lying next to the Lagoon pool",
        "The assistant Manager took us to a pool side room on the ground floor, in the smoking section",
        "The coffee house where breakfast is served is by a pond which is so picturesque",
        "My wife and I just returned from Bali where we stayed at the Nusa Dua Resort and Spa, we stayed in a Palace Club room which opened on to beautiful gardens and pond full of Koi",
        "Overall though the resort was excellent I'd give it 8/10 and I would definiatley go back, I cant say the same about the rest of Bali though, Kuta for one is simply filthy and you get swarmed upon by people trying to sell you something or simply to rip you off",
        "Outside of the resort I found everyone to basically to be a liar and a con man",
        "We also went to Jimbaran Bay and was honestly quite horrified at the condition or restauarnts and general hygiene, we felt far from safe walking down the street, especailly with groups of men all sitting on the side of the road looking menacingly towards us, I hoenstly thought we were a moment from being robbed or worse, we couldn't get a cab quick enough to get back to the resort",
        "So the qestion is would I go back and it the answer is a qualified yes however I would just stay in the resort and that would be fine!",
        "This Resort is great",
        "+ beautiful pool",
        "The resort bathrooms were the smallest we have ever experienced in Bali,unable to accomodate more than one person at any given time",
        "On the plus side the pools were good and the resort surrounds impeccably clean",
        "A true Balinese resort - great value for money - pleasing service - good food - lovely pool",
        "say hi to Anum, a friendly waiter at the pool",
        "Our first stay at this very traditional and beautiful Balinese Resort (and wont be our last) and loved every minute",
        "For people who are looking to do serious swimming, hit the spa pool",
        "It is long-shaped and intended for lap pool",
        "It has 2 children's pools and a koi pond",
        "pool view and beach view with a well connected kids room (see tip)",
        "Rooms were very average, and clearly this part of the resort has not yet been renovated",
        "Resort facilities including swimming pools, spa, tennis courts, bike hire, massage were all very good, but it was hard to look past the problems in the rooms hence we probably won't return here in the future",
        "The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel has a more open feel and the pools are definitely the most newly renovated",
        "The resort itself is nice, with multiple food options",
        "The hotel is totally renovated and gives an impression of a luxurious and stylish resort with high standard in rooms, area and restaurants",
        "This is a stunning resort",
        "Best of all, guests have free access to the spa 'lap' pool, which is enormous",
        "The standards here are really high and the attention to detail is what lifts it above other resorts we have visited",
        "the pools were beautiful and the beach so close",
        "The pool and pool bar was great! Indonesian alcohol prices or though",
        "Room as far as possible from pool and beach",
        "Gym was one of the hottest ones I have ever worked out in and they had run out of drinking water",
        "Becomes a pain after a while no matter how much you try to control the water pressure",
        "Resort - Lovely pools and plenty of sun loungers",
        "a nice little pool basketball area too which I quite enjoyed",
        "Other facilities were good as you would expect from a 5 star resort - games room, business centre etc",
        "Perhaps this is the usual amongst all the resorts but still found it quite a pain for a resort of this size",
        "All in all a great resort which ticked all the boxes for us in terms of relaxing and luxurious holiday with friendly people",
        "Great pools! The staff were super friendly always stopped to say good morning or hello without hesitation",
        "Locationwise, it is quite close from the Nusa Dua Resort gate (so it's easy to remember the way)",
        "The resort is vast and the gardens are very beautiful and well kept, we nearly do not want to leave the resort!",
        "I would recommend this to anyone who would like to enjoy traditional Balinese architecture and great hospitality, beautiful resort and take advantage of the swimming pool and the lovely garden",
        "From checking in, requesting another room which was immediately granted (no fault of the hotel), the pool, the restaurants, the food, the rooms and room service, the beds, the setting, the quiet music at the pool / lounge / bar, the service - and not the least the smiles at all times - it was a great and very relaxing experience",
        "The Fitness Centre was never crowded and there are three pools to choose from",
        "it's surreal to be in such a beautiful place, the resort, the people, the island",

        "THE swimming pool was amazing me and my family spend allot of hours there swimming, they have so many activities around the pool area and the pool it self",
        "They have 3-4 different pools each one being nicer than the other",
        "What a frustrating waste of time! This is really unacceptable for a luxury hotel of this caliber that also caters to business travelers as well as vacationers",
        "The hotel has a couple of great pools to swim in and several restaurants catering for different tastes",
        "The pool area was excellent with with an area of grass and trees between hotel pools and sandy beach",

        "Take a 2 min walk to the road outside the resort and get a better rate on cabs",
        "There are about 5 resturants in the resort",
        "We ate at two, there is one which is authentic Bali fare which was ok but would have been nice if they told us we would be paying $3 per bottle of water and $10 for corkage",
        "But the pool was great so no big loss",
        "quiet area, walking distance to shops and restaurants although plenty to choose from within resort,",

        "There are 3 pools:one has a bar, one has a volleyball net, and the 3rd a basket ball thingy",
        "Too much fun to play pool volleyball",
        "View on swimming pool and a little bit further the sea",
        "There is ample security at this resort making you feel safe and secure",
        "There were 2 main pools in addition there were child/baby friendly pools, so expect some comotion, but peaceful enough",
        "I found the Spa facilities lovely, there is a spa pool located near the front end of the hotel, near the gym",

        "Right on the beach but with 4-5 great pools",
        "We asked what one Balinese Dish shoud we try, we were told the Duck special at Raja's",
        "They have 3 pools and it is lovely to walk around the beach path",
        "The rooms are exquisite as are the pools",
        "Big resort and from our room at the top floor was 10 minutes walk to reach the pool and the beach",
        "One of the reasons we booked the hotel is because it is older and has a strong Balinese influence, it is not just another generic resort (we could have stayed closer to home and got that!)",
        "Beaches, pools and restaurants were all fantastic!! Thank you For being the only place in Bali where we could order duck without a 24 hour pre-order! Palace club breakfasts were delicious! We were a bit disappointed that we were not made aware of the dress codes for the early evening cocktails before our arrival! Although I guess we could have gone shopping and purchased something appropriate we were kinda over the shopping bit after 12 days and were just wanting to relax, so unfortunately we missed out on this part of our package",
        "More room then we needed as we were always out by the pool",
        "My five year old was so at home he would order lunch and drinks for the family on the beach or by the pool",

        "They feed right from your fingers and some even jump on the pond's ledge",
        "I would choose this hotel again as it has Balinese culture architecture and the setting is beautiful the moment you enter the resort",
        "Swimming pool was clean, so is the overall hotel area",
        "Also, there's literally no wave on the beach shore, which is probably good if you have small kids who want to play in the water safely and freely",
        "after spending 3 nights in ubud (which was not bad at all) one would certainly be swept away with the massive and elegant layout of this resort",
        "i wasted no time in going around the resort as i felt our length of stay to be insufficient to cover much ground",
        "food served in the resort was excellent and in good proportion",
        "a gated subdivision comprising of huge resort complexes",
        "The pool were very nice",
        "Only used the kids club once which the kids seemed to enjoy but they preferred to be in the pool! Drinks and food in the hotel are extremely over priced as are the spa services - Bali collection which is only a 2 min taxi ride ($1) or 10 min walk away is the place to eat and cheap massages and beauty treatments available in spas at the main gates of Nusa dua also walking distance ($8-$10) for one hour massage",
        "The resort will remind you, you are in Bali every time you wake up",
        "The resort structure is very Balinese, you can have good background shoot",
        "However, the resort seem is a little old, maybe this is Bali style",
        "The pools were well maintained and never seemed overcrowded",
        "For those who prefer the pool, the hotel also has a couple of large beautiful pools, which are great for swimming",
        "It is quieter and beautiful plants lined the side of that pool with relaxing music playing in the background, creating the most tranquil atmosphere for total relaxation",
        "All in all was a nice stay, I would recommend this resort to my friends and family and would stay there again",
        "Of course, this is \"resort\" Bali so take some trips outside this very nice enclave too",
        "Spent 2 nights at the resort, rooms are spacious and clean (traditional Balinese decor)",
        "If you looking for personal attention you will not find this here as this is a big resort with lots of rooms",
        "Food is a bit pricey but what do you expect from a 5 star resort",
        "It is Nusa so all the hotels/resorts are all within the Resort compounds",
        "good for water sports",
        "The pool is excellent, and the spa services also, even if a bit expensive",
        "We feel like we have arrived home when we get out of the car at the reception to \"our resort\"",
        "I find it so tiring just walking to the swimming pool and the beach",
        "As others have mentioned, the restaurants/drinks in hotel can be quite expensive (compared to those outside) but we found them very good and we appreciated the proximity to the pool and our room",
        "As others have mentioned, the restaurants/drinks in hotel can be quite expensive (compared to those outside) but we found them very good and we appreciated the proximity to the pool and our room",
        "The pools work well, a smaller pool that contains a volleyball net and has a sandy entrance is a good middle-ground, whilst next to that is a small kid safe pool with a basketball hoop",
        "The main pool has a swim-up bar, and is large enough to not feel in each other's pockets",
        "only thing which disappointed was the size of the pool",
        "The conference actually used facilities at the Westin and the neighboring Laguna resort, and got to see quite a bit of all three",
        "I had a ground-floor room opening out onto the pool area",
        "The pool area is pretty nice, although smaller than other resorts",
        "Expensive, but I guess you would expect that at a resort",
        "We were most pleased with the every thing connected with the Hotel / Resort",
        "We could all stay in the same suite with independent bedrooms, and a private pool!!",
        "While Nusa Dua is a bit of a resort enclave, the hotel building itself still had a lovely Balinese feel to it",
        "- The rooms and the whole resort is extremely well maintained",
        "- complimentary water (2 bottles) get filled up every day, I had the impression even two times",
        "Both times we went into the jacuzzi we were the only ones there and at the lap pool there were 2 other people in lounges in the shade and we were the only ones in the water",
        "It's a bit away from the rooms but quiet, relaxing and a nice change from the main pools",
        "The main pools, no matter how many people were in and around it, never felt busy or noisy although the swim up pool bar did fill up at times (but the drinks were so delicious you can't really blame people for staying there)",
        "Hotel was lovely, pool was amazing and spent many hours soaking up the sun",
        "If you travel with kids, this hotel has many kids pool and has sandy pool as well",
        "M has only one pool for kids and no sandy pool is available",
        "The rooms close to the pool and Gecko is very convenient",
        "The resort is spacious and well maintained",
        "The grounds and pools are immaculate",
        "Bintang 54,000 rph at resort and 17,000 at Circle K",
        "We have stayed at resorts on several occasions now and this one is up with best of them",
        "pools are fantastic",
        "We stayed at the resort in April with our 20 month old son",
        "The resort grounds are beautiful but the exterior of the hotel buildings (not the reception area) are a bit tired",
        "The rooms was nice, comfortable and clean but not as nice as I had expected for a five star resort",
        "The pools were lovely and great for our young son to play in",
        "The beach is clean (for Bali) but the water is still pretty polluted (the beach is clean because the rubbish is cleaned by hotel staff throughout the day but check out all of the debris on the rocks when the tide goes out for a true picture of how clean the water is)",
        "Our greatest issue was probably the cost of actually being at the resort",
        "i stayed at this hotel in march for our wedding it is a incredible resort to get married at the resort grounds were stunning staff fantastic",
        "the barmen at the pool bar has to be one of the best as he always said hello to you by name when he saw you down by the pool",
        "great pools & beach area",
        "The breakfast was just OK, but I love the surrounding of the restaurant, they have a beautiful and big fish pond",
        "Great swimming pool and beach",
        "I could not have been happier with this resort",
        "The pools are really nice",
        "The pool at the spa is amazing",
        "It is a lap pool with champak trees",
        "As I swam in the pool, the champak flowers fell in the water",
        "I stayed in the resort in 2009 and i think i owe this resort a review",
        "this place is just incredible - it is the most beautiful resort that i have ever seen by far",
        "The grounds of this resort are stunning and so well maintained",
        "This resort is a five minute walk from shops and other eateries, and a good 15 minute walk from open air shopping centre with plenty of boutiques and restaurants",
        "My partner and I stayed at this resort in March 2012 and loved it! The staff are very friendly and more than accommodating",
        "The resort itself is lovely with nice pools and a swim up bar",
        "Overall the stay was very relaxing, and would recommend this resort",
        "The resort is well located and is in a great position in the bay",
        "There are two pools and we preferred to swim in the older pool which has a sand bottom and was very relaxing",
        "This is an excellent gem of a resort",
        "I didn't want to stay at a sterile five star resort which could be anywhere (Hawaii, CA, etc",
        "During our first visit in 2010 the hotel seemed to be lacking the customer service you expect from a five star resort",
        "The complex is huge and the pool is large (although quite a distance from alot of the rooms so ask for a room close to the pool, this will also enable better beach views)",
        "Subsequently there was another security check point before entering the resort",
        "The resort itself is huge",
        "When we first step foot into the resort, we felt as if we had been transported to another world",
        "Very cultural and balinese deco greeted us at the entrance to the resort and also the lobby",
        "Walking further, we realised that the resort is even bigger than what we initailly thought",
        "Both of our rooms came with a balcony that overlooked the pool and garden area which was great",
        "There were a number of international restaurants located within the resort",
        "To our left are Club Med and Conrad and to our right; westin and laguna",
        "The resort does maintain the beach pretty well",
        "Overall, this resort is one of the best, if not the best that i had ever stayed",
        "One of the most courteous and efficient check ins ever and a terrific spacious 'Premium' room, overlooking pool, gardens and beach",
        "A turndown service is provided every night with slippers being set out beside the bed on slipper mats and a refresh of the room is done; emptying garbage, replenishing water, etc",
        "Pools were good but normal problem with greedy self centred tourists who \"reserve\" their poolside lounge first thing in the morning and don't use it till the afternoon",
        "The Pool staff see other inconsiderate guests leave the pool area without returning their towels but don't get off their backsides and collect them and consequently guests don't know if lounges are being used",
        "The hotel is very big with 3 pools and various restaurants in the hotel",
        "The pool at the spa (which all hotels residents can use) is a delight",
        "My only other gripe with the hotel itself is that they seriously need to consider replacing the old brown towels at the spa pool, and perhaps new ones by the main pools also, as they are starting to look quite tatty",
        "When we stayed last January, the spa cafe provided complimentary water by the pool, but this was no longer offered; also, the spa cafe didn't keep regular hours, and no one came around offering snacks or beverages, even though there was only 30% occupancy at the resort",
        "We only had 2 days to go on our Bali holiday and after a week at another 5 star resort we decided to relocate finish our holiday at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa",
        "The rooms, grounds, pools and waterfront areas are magnificent too",
        "There is no need to leave the resort with all its resturants, but we did visit the local Bali Collection shopping centre for a look around and buy souveniers for the grandchildren",
        "Truly balinese touch throughout the resort",
        "This is also a good place to stock up your bottled water",
        "Jan 2012, we only stayed 2 nights here and then stayed at a couple of other resorts, from the moment we arrived right through until we left this place was gorgeous",
        "They were all so helpful always, and would always acknowledge their guests all the time with a smile and a hello, throughout the resort",
        "The hotel pools are both nice",
        "The spa was great and we went everyday to their pool, hot tub and sauna",
        "I agree with Sndra 88, it needed updating, but there were some parts of the resort that were under construction, so hopefully it will help",
        "The hotel is situated on one of the best beaches in Bali, seawater is beautiful warm and clean and pool areas are great",
        "The ambiance created at every area of the resort is amazing",
        "The pools are lovely but we did have problems getting lounges",
        "30am and almost all the lounges around the pool were already taken but remained empty till early afternoon",
        "The beach is nice and clean and the water was clear",
        "I'm not sure if i would go back to NDBH, the hotel itself and the staff were all wonderful, unfortunately they book in large groups of Russian who are extremely rude and let their kids run riot around the pools and restaurants",
        "3 out of 4 rooms were beautiful, overlooking the pool and garden, whilst the other room was further from ours and was overlooking a garden (which was still nice, but not as nice as ours)",
        "The water sports centre is a few km down path to hotel",
        "There are many water sport activities based on Benoa, so you have to go to Benoa first before you do anything else",
        "Breakfast is excellent, room service is quick, the pools are good (when they're not over run with children, but you can escape to the spa pool of you feel there is too much going on in the main pools)",
        "3) the mini bar is expensive (which they always are but there is no space to store your own water which is a shame)",
        "The pool and beach areas are nice, there were some major yobbos around the pool, jumping off the pool bar so that spoilt the serenity",
        "We checked out and headed back to KP where we had a huge suite overlooking the pool with great restaurants/massages/shopping at our fingertips, for the same price as NDBH!",
        "We arrived at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our last night in Bali after 4 nights in a pool villa in Seminyak which, whilst OK, was not what we had expected due to a major stuff up by Villas Indonesia Properties, who were supposed to book us into the new Nusa Dua Boutique Villa Resort",
        "I was a little disappointed in the distance we had to walk from reception to our room, but it was OK once we'd done it a few times and the view and location were worth it - we were right at the pools and restaurants, so that was great",
        "We would have appreciated more complimentary bottled water each day, as it is necessary to consume a great deal to rehydrate",
        "00am, we were able to leave our bags with the concierge and make use of the hotel pool and other facilities until we needed to leave",
        "We stayed for 8 days & tried all the restaurants on site & all were good but my favourite has to be the pizzeria which is in the middle of the complex right next to the swimming pools",
        "The pools are lovely",
        "(Note: Nusa Dua was very quiet in general, so the lack of crowds was not a reflection of the hotel",
        "Maybe ask for a room away from the pool and restaurants if you really want absolute quiet",
        "The plunge pool area was lovely though",
        "The second pool seemed to be in need of renovation, but still useable",
        "As the hotel was not busy, the main pool was enough for us",
        "The all of the beach are secure with security gates & surround just by 5 start resort & hotel",
        "After some search we chose the Nusa Dua beach resort",
        "The resort has good sport club they also have squash court, try the court & play with the club coach was fantastic experience",
        "we also try the morning bicycle riding tour & every they have aerobic exercise & volleyball at pool",
        "At the pool area I intrude to scuba diving booths and start to learn diving & get the PADI open weather license",
        "The lap pool stunning",
        "Pool water was hot",
        "The pools are good for families with children and offer a non-chlorinated pool as well",
        "It really is a gorgeous resort",
        "I went during the off season so the resort overall was on the quiet side",
        "Very quiet place to relax and just lay by the pool",
        "Aside from that, it was a great place to stay with a decent kids club, pool bar and babysitting available",
        "You wouldn't swim at the beach because of sea urchins but the pools make up for that with a beach style pool for the kids and a deeper one with a bar for adults",
        "Only half a litre of complimentary water per person",
        "The rooms are serviced twice daily and we were never lacking or wanting for anything (Thank you for the complimentary water daily)",
        "We also enjoyed snacks by the pool and daily drinks at the swim up pool bar",
        "The pools are beautiful and the view gorgeous",
        "Come here if you want to spend your time getting spa treatments, swim in the pool and be pampered",
        "Since I was only drinking bottled water, the free bottled water in the room was appreciated",
        "Overall, as long as you are going for romance and/or relaxation, i recommend Nusa Dua Beach Resort",
        "The grounds are just beautiful, there are very beautiful water gardens and the foyer area is very grand",
        "The resort is lovely, very traditional but HUGE! Our Rooms were nice and clean",
        "We booked the Deluxe rooms which were big enough and had a balcony overlooking the pool, beach and gardens, but we asked to move to ground floor rooms with garden access so it was easier to get to the pool",
        "Pools great with activities for children",
        "pool and gym are really good",
        "There are amazing water features and gardens and fit so well together and make this largish hotel feel small",
        "The private beach is very nice, and the water is quite",
        "The pool is lovely, I am not a great pool person anyway",
        "This hotel is located in a secluded 5 star resort area that is catering for the 5 star client",
        "I took a walk along the beach and there are other hotels all the way along and i wouldn't say that any other hotels in nusa dua are better than the beach and spa resort",
        "nice pools etc, staff great",
        "The hotel was spotlessly clean, from the pool area to the fish ponds",
        "The later is more like a 7 star Hotel, so when I got to Nusa Dua Beach Resort I was almost upset",
        "Ever so slightly tired around the pool areas - pools not quite as flash as the ones at the Westin or some of the others, the pool loungers older, towels not as smart - but frankly, the prices reflect that",
        "Luckily you could avoid them mostly, but its not what I expected from this type of hotel (and probably not something they can always avoid I guess - although maybe not serving Bintang in the pool until lunchtime?!)",
        "I should add they have water aerobics in the pool every morning - I am sure some people love it, but it is a pet hate of mine at hotels to have ridiculously loud music pumping through the pool area at 10am and shouting instructor, but maybe that is just me!",
        "Pool",
        "Instead playing sand under the shade in the pool",
        "The pool is really warm, lucky my little 5 years old mad scientist brought thermometer, so we got some readings on Sept",
        "2, and pool 30",
        "For comparison, 2 days later in melia's pool was 29",
        "Senior staffs working around the pool gives the dino hotel an old charm",
        "Got so close to me and snatched the cookie off my cappuccino around the pool",
        "Apart from the weddin most of us were there between 4-10days and it was fabulous, the rooms are beautiful, and if you want to get away for quiet times a lap pool with Cafe was just the best",
        "I would thoughly recommend this resort, its great value for money, no hawkers to bother you, and the best service I've ever had",
        "Loved the place, the pool and beach are side by side and are both amazing",
        "- As honeymooners I expected at least a tiny bit of fuss to be made of us - something to make us feel a little special",
        "- Water",
        "The breakfast dining area was located by a fabulous pond and plants",
        "The hotel grounds are very nice, there are 2 pools next to each other, 1 lagoon style and 1 freeform concrete, both a good size",
        "Nusa Dua is a resort area and I would only stay here if you want to unwind by sitting by the pool and not doing much",
        "However, if I was to saty in Bali again I would stay at this resort",
        "Stay here if you want to enjoy the quiet side of Bali and relax in a quiet untroubled beach front resort",
        "Second time to Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa and loved every minute",
        "In summary - don't hesitate to go to Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa",
        "The breakfast buffet was extremely good as were the eggs to order and the setting by the pond was gorgeous",
        "We travelled around quite a bit and took in lots of Bali - we particularly liked Ubud where we went white water rafting and stayed in a fabulous hotel (reviewed separately)",
        "This resort is unbelievably beautiful",
        "Our suite was located in the Palace Club section of the resort",
        "The pools are stunning",
        "The drive-in entry to the resort is very impressive and majestic as is the lobby",
        "It even has its own lap pool with lounge chairs",
        "This was our first trip back to Bali in about 10 years and we are checking our diaries on how soon we can get back to the Nusa Dua Beach Resort & Spa",
        "Very hard to fault the resort, it seems like they have thought of everything, different pools, bars and restaurants all have their own ambience and vibe",
        "Though do note regarding the Main Pool and Lagoon pool that they both close at 7pm",
        "The hotel however also has a small 25m Lap Pool which is available until 10pm, no under 12s allowed in this area too",
        "If were to return to Bali we would stay at this resort again and hopefully see our only complaints resolved",
        "Upon checking in we were relegared to Rm 3209, which overlooks the driveway amd is a bus trip from the pools and beach",
        "30 minutes later we had a delightful porter show us to our room, as well as giving a quick guide of the resort and facilities on offer in the room, a tip well-earned for this young man!",
        "We loved the spa lap pool, I enjoy swimming so was able to get plenty of exercise",
        "My husband and I spent nearly 4months hunting every nook and corner of Tripadvisor for a Best Pick of the Resort fit for Honeymoon at Bali ! Must say, the efforts were worth it",
        "The cleanliness and maintainance of the entire Resort is definitely of high standards",
        "Nusa Dua Resort also provides timely pick up and drops at specified timings throughout the Day to the local Mall - \"Bali Collection\" which boasts of abundant eateries covering mostly all major cuisines of the world",
        "Loby is open and unbelievable , very nice small pools in the garden full of colorful fishes",
        "Hotel has big and very nice swimming pool",
        "About the see to be honest I was expecting to see better see like Maldives but here it was different",
        "The swimming pools was also clean and comforting, with our baby on his own swimtrainer ring didn't want to get out from the pool",
        "They have 2 main swimming pool, one is the standard square-like pool, and the others is beach-like pool who had sandy beach side at the edge of the pool",
        "But we let him play with the sand at the beach, and yes the water is chill",
        "Have just spent a fantastic 8 days at this resort",
        "4 nights at your stunning resort is never enough",
        "The resort is looking amazing after your upgrades and we look forward to coming back again",
        "there were plenty of pools to chill by",
        "It was musty, the bathroom was dated; the bath (with shower over) was stained, had a rusty bath plug, black, mouldy sealing around it and it took almost 30 minutes before the water turned from black to clear",
        "We didnt use spa or salon facilities due to being over priced, if you go to town you'll find that spa prices 50% cheaper than at the resort, so as restaurants are very expensive, so we didnt eat in the resort, we had to go outside",
        "Other than that nice resort",
        "This is one of the original resorts in Nusa Dua",
        "So many of the other resorts only make a passing nod to Indonesia",
        "I would say for people who want to go to Bali for Bali, not a resort maybe stay here a few days then head to a more cultural area",
        "The pool facility was immense with plenty of lounge chairs to find",
        "We also loved the pool bar as part of it is close to the kids pools that we could watch the kids whilst having a bintang or 2",
        "The pools were fantastic and were a great way to wind down after a long day walking and shopping",
        "The resort is in a secured complex that lies within the secured area of Nusa Dua we felt very safe here at all times",
        "Over all I would definitely recommend this resort and would stay here again if coming to Bali again",
        "If you like the hustle and bustle of Kuta this resort and location is not for you",
        "The 2 lagoon pools are a good size with plenty of sun lounges around both pools and in front of the well manicured gardens and sandy beach, never any problems finding a sun lounge and the pool team always there to assist and offer food & beverage service",
        "The facilities also include a beautiful lap pool and spa cafe, and only persons above the age of 12 years allowed",
        "Rooms are always clean, amenties incl water stocked up daily, beds tunred down each night",
        "Stayed at the Resort for a week -- great experience -- lovely beach front except of you are looking for waves you dont get them here",
        "The beach front is very calm which means you do find a lot of weeds in the water",
        "I was travelling with my mom and my sister and we really took avantage of the pool and beach",
        "It is impossible not to get water everywhere! Everyday we soaked the floor",
        "The resort is lovely, very traditional but HUGE! Our Rooms were nice and clean- a little far from the pool but that's only cause the the resort is so big",
        "This resort is absolutely huge",
        "They have a wonderful lap pool and top class gym",
        "Complimentary water and beans around the pool was lovely",
        "The pools are clean and refreshing",
        "It got pretty hot during the class, but they offer water",
        "Complimentary bottled water was replaced every day",
        "This resort is excellent if you want to relax being peaceful",
        "Even after seeing the photos, arriving at the resort still blew me away",
        "The secondary pool leaves a bit to be desired",
        "They also had one of those 'half' shower screens so water went everywhere",
        "The sea however, because protected by a reef is very shallow and the bottom not very pleasant to walk on but, the hotel pools more than made up for this",
        "Free bottled water was given every day and if I drank that before the housekeeper came to do turn down service, the water was replenished",
        "the pools",
        "The main pool with the swim up bar is really nice",
        "The other pool needs the bottom painted and it would also be very nice",
        "The water bottles are not included in the hotel price, which with regard that you cannot drink tap water is very cheap",
        "We did take one bottle of water from the mini bar and had to pay 75",
        "Im generally not one for \"sit on a beach/at a pool and relax\" holidays, but this was a very nice place to spend one",
        "We found this resort to be a very good value and were happy with our stay",
        "If you demand a 5-star resort, you will probably want to look elsewhere",
        "Main pool has been re-tiled, etc & looks great",
        "2nd pool will be given face-lift later this year",
        "the hotel's beach is dirty and u cant swim there in case of low tide,in morning it's around one and half meter high,but full of algae,in afternoon water runs so far away,till reef",
        "I could go on about the resort, beach and food, which were all amazing! But what I think was most memorable about the place where the staff",
        "The resort itslef is lovely and very traditional in comparison to some of the other resorts in the area",
        "However, I was glad that this resort has a lot of character",
        "Sometimes staying at one of the big chain resorts, it starts to feel like you could be anywhere because they all look the same in that nice, big hotel sort of way",
        "At Nusa Dua, we were reminded everyday that we were in Bali because of the design of the resort",
        "They were going through renovations during our stay near the pool area but we were not disturbed at all",
        "The resort was absolutely lovely",
        "Overall I would highly recommend this resort",
        "The hotel is the \"oldest\" of the newer huge resorts in Nusa Dua",
        "Main pool areas as described, no obvious problems with sun lounger availability but we tended to go later in the afternoon",
        "I'd recommend this resort for those enjoyimg a beach holiday setting, but if looking for more culture and the real Bali head for Ubud and some of the amazing hotels in that region",
        "Since our last stay, the pool area has been thoroughly remodelled - there are now two main pools - though we actually spent most of our time at the bliss-out beautiful and quiet spa pool",
        "Very few rooms here have a proper pool or a sea view",
        "At the time of our stay, part of the hotel was being renovated and the main pool was out of action but there was no noticeable noise or dust and the other pool was pleasant and not crowded",
        "Although one of the pools was under construction the amenities in the hotel were still fabulous",
        "The pool was lovely and a long walk along the beach passed other hotels",
        "Luckily, the hotel had vast green grounds with ponds, ducks, swans, so that we could venture out and have good time without tiring my son",
        "The pool is fun and opens up right to the sandy beach",
        "BUT, don't get stuck at the hotel pool everyday -you can do that at home! Be sure to get out and see BALI while you're there! Hire a driver (only $40 US dollars for an entire day! and have them take you to see traditional Balinese temples, the Monkey Forest, go river rafting, ride elephants and go snorkeling",
        "We left just as the main pool was closing, which would be something of a disadvantage, but the second pool was still available, as well as the children's areas",
        "* there is another pool called the lagoon that did not seem very clean",
        "Also the main pool is to be renovated, so out of action for next 3 months - I hope they also renovate the Lagoon pool because this appeared to be in a greater need of renovation, but it was still pleasant to swim in (and I'm very fussy about cleanliness and hygiene)",
        "The spa was very nice, I treated myself to a massage and had a nice peaceful swim in the spa pool",
        "The main pools are good, one is more for the children, and the other one has a swim-up bar, the water is warm",
        "If you want to relax by the pool all day then this is a great hotel to stay at",
        "We walked around the other neighbouring resorts and we thought that this hotel has the best kept grounds and pools",
        "We didn't eat in the resort but ate at Bali Collection which is about a 15min walk or a free shuttle bus away",
        "All of them are of a bery high standard but I really fell in love with this resort",
        "There are 2 pools",
        "The room we had was very spacious and comfortable and not too far from the pools",
        "The pools were great and our son spent most of the day in one or the other! but the relaxing atmosphere was interupted at 11am each morning by loud 'Euro Pop' for the Aqua Aerobicss followed by volleyball!! I used the spa and had a lovely treatment",
        "The spa is being refurbished at the moment so they are using some of the guest rooms - it was a shame as I couldn't use the spa pool",
        "Pool area) are WAY to small concerning the amount of beds that it hosts and also the value for money factor",
        "I felt very lucky that it wasn't full because that would've made it extremely hard to get into the pool or into the breakfast area",
        "- very dirty pool (green stuff growing on the walls)",
        "- small pools and area around them, concerning amount of guests the hotel can host",
        "nice pool and gardens",

        "Pools were ok",
        "Has 4 swimming pools and 5 restaurants",
        "The pool was large and seemed nice (I didn't go in)",
        "A great resort to stay, however not if you want to experience the Indonesian feeling",
        "Nusa Dua is a specially designed part of Bali for resorts",
        "But if you just want to relax at the pool or the beach it is a great stay",
        "As other reviewers have mentioned the resort is somehow old but perfectly maintained",
        "Pools & beach are beautiful & relaxing",
        "The hotel has 2 pools, a main pool and a lagoon pool which are both lovely",
        "There was also a lap pool, however we didn't see this because it was in the spa area and this was being refurbished during our stay",

        "Nice pool with plenty of room for the kids not to annoy everyone",
        "The size of swimming pools are decent",
        "The beach is charming, the sand were spotless which means a lot when the crystal water in the low tide is full of seaweed",
        "The ;pool and pool area had nothing that was above an average hotel",
        "The resort is so beautiful, truly heaven! We spent a 6 day honeymoon there and took trips all over Bali",

        "Each room has daily toiletries, safe, water and a turn down service which was around 5",

        "Other than that the resort offered lots of activities and various shows every night",
        "The pool was the best",
        "I have never seen a pool this nice in a long time",
        "I'm just marking the area that needs improvements on the part of this magnificent resort",
        "Pool:",
        "THere are many pools to choose from",
        "I had requested an upgraded room and was surprised that one of my tour guests in a standard room had a larger, ocean view room - by comparision, mine was small and overlooked the duck pond",
        "Now, I did not mind the duck pond view, but the noise at sun-up was more alarm clock than I wanted",
        "When we arrived I really thought that they had taken us to the wrong resort",
        "I asked my kids what they really loved about the resort and they said that you could stay their , never leave and never get bored",
        "I can't recommend this resort highly enough",
        "Highly Recommend The Palace Club - A Wonderful breakfast buffet in such a serene location overlooking the duck pond",
        "We declined as we just loved being able to walk out of our room directly to the duck pond",
        "But when come back next time definetely will stay minimum 2 nights to enjoy the ambiance, pool and beach and will try the spa",
        "The hotel has three pools, a lap pool located near the spa - has its own bar and is pretty quiet this pool stays open until 10:00pm",
        "The other two pool situated near the beach are lovely and opened 7:00am - 8:00pm",
        "Also alongside these pools is a children's pool which is smaller and shallower",

        "It has a beautiful, huge pool which the hotel is centred around",
        "There is also 2 toddlers pools and a swim up bar",
        "If I stayed without children I would suggest a Deluxe room as these are on the ground level,have a little front porch and go straight out to the pool",
        "Last year we stayed in private villas in Bali and it was amazing, that's my tip! Fantastic for families",
        "Stay at Nusa Dua Beach Resort if you would like a relaxing holiday away from all the hustle and bustle and do not want to do anything except lie around a beautiful pool all day (and night)",
        "Next time I would like to try laguana and Westin",
        "With pampering, romatic dinners and lounging by the pool in mind, our choice fell on the Nusa Dua area",
        "The grounds were stunning (with small squirrels visiting our balcony every morning), pools were crystal clean and the spa facilities tranquil and not too crowded",
        "the pool area is fantastic and yes there can some geman-itus in respect to the towels but its a holiday worst things happen in the world",
        "You will notice the difference when you leave the resort",
        "Also a steam room, plunge pool, day bed and complete privacy",

        "Grounds and pools were excellent and well maintained",
        "Would definitely recommend this Resort to all who were looking to stay in the Nusa Dua area",

        "they have many swimming pools, was particularly amazed by the sandy pool",
        "We walked over to the Westin Resort and regretted not staying there instead as the lobby and pool area seemed much cleaner and more comfortable",
        "A fabolous Red Snapper and superb tiger prawns, verz simplz grilled on wooden fire",
        "The complex is huge and luxurious, so if you really want a tourist resort holiday, there's lots of swimming pools, and a beach area",
        "There was two large pool, never crowded and big enough for swimming, great pool bar and plenty of sunbeds",
        "Pools: Excellent",
        "We paid around USD$130 per night which is not expensive at all by international standards for a resort of this quality",
        "The resort is over 20 years old & has not been renovated in that time and it shows",
        "The pools look quite nice but you cannot get a lounge after 10am, mostly due to guests putting a towel & newspaper on them in the morning & not returning until the afternoon if at all",
        "I would probably consider the Westin or the Laguna if we returned to Nusa Dua",
        "I am amazed that such a big resort has nothing in place for beach rescue",
        "Pool was very nice -- two pools, one of them quite big, with a swim-up bar",
        "The 2 swimming pools were clean and fabulous",
        "The lagoon pool offered a good alternative to swimmers who looked for a bit of sea-water feel and also proved to be highly popular with families with very young children as the kids could wade in easily and scooped up the sand with their buckets",
        "We had a few sumptuous lunches at the two restaurants near the pool",
        "Swimminpool area is gorgeous, you can choose from two swimming pools",
        "We stayed at the resort for seven nights in a Palace Club room from 8th to the 15th June",
        "The pools were good, never crowded, the pool with the lagoon style which has a small area which is sanded underneath looks like it is need of some refurbishment, the main pool was lovely",
        "Returned from this resort two days ago, use tripadvisor a lot so decided to write a very honest review about this hotel",
        "Pools: Again, extremely aged",
        "Main pool and spa pool OK",
        "Baby and children's pools were old and not maintained",
        "Definitely a better part of the resort for those without children",

        "it was a 2 mins walk to the pools and the lobby",
        "we had breakfast every day overlooking a pond and gardens",
        "we did use the lap pool by the spa as it was really quiet there and relaxing",
        "the other pools were great and we made full use of the swin up bar ordered lots of oreo milkshakes! my hubby used the gym and was impressed with the selection of the machines",
        "Specifically we wanted a tropical beachfront resort to warm our bones in the Aussie winter and we got all of that and a lot more than we really expected",
        "The other facilities such as the gym, lap pool, kayak & winsurfer hire, internet room, games room, ATM, bank, resort shop, room service, swim-up pool bar, bike hire, taxi counter, consierge, duty managers and so on make the resort a wonderful place to stay, so much so that we will be returning in 2010",
        "I am also pleased to report that we came away with zero mosquito bites - a small thing, perhaps, but we have stayed at other resorts where we ended up scratching our arms and legs for a week after we got home",
        "The pools were great - warm and well kept",
        "I would agree in one sense, but it depends upon what you are looking for",
        "Where the Conrad had all sorts of water features, the NDBH has gorgeous grounds with beautiful landscaping and wonderful Bali features",
        "The Nusa Dua beach area is the focal point of the resort",
        "It has great landscaping with multiple restaurants, bars, pools, etc",
        "An advantage the NDBH has over the Conrad is the lack of noisy water sports off it's beach",
        "The moment we entered, the resort made an immediate impression",
        "The resort is large, with great pools",
        "What I liked the most about pools was the depth up to 2",
        "25 meters",
        "Most hotels and resorts restrict the depth to 1",
        "They have free squash and tennis courts, pool table, PS3 etc",
        "Also stayed at the Bali Water villa 4+5 in Ungasan which is the most amazing place I've stayed in so far, yes out did the Evason Phuket!! see my other reviews :)",
        "Taxi everywhere you go outside of resort",
        "We just enjoyed lazing by the pools and the beach then sipping cocktails at the beach bar! We also ventured outside the main gates to eat a few times into Nusa Dua Village",
        "We were tempted to laze by this pool many times because it is so peaceful, but just never got there",
        "The main pool was sometimes loud with children and splashing but the spa pool was always quiet and relaxing for an afternoon read",
        "The beach is beautiful and so are the swimming pools",
        "I stayed at the resort with my husband and two young kids (4 and 3 years old) and had a wonderful time at the resort",
        "On arrival at the resort, you would be greeted by the magnificent Bali architecture at the entrance and through out the hotel premise",
        "We were staying at the family room on the 3rd floor at the corner, overlooking the swimming pool",
        "The resort ground is huge and provides ample space for everyone",
        "There's pool side dining, beach side dining but we took a stroll and had a fabulous meal at Westin (and befriended a terrific dude) next door",
        "The beach chairs do get claimed early, but we found that the spa pool is open to all guests and was never crowded! It's also shaded and does not allow children",
        "We spent 7 nights at this resort and from the moment of arrival we were in love with the place",
        "We ventured into the ocean a couple of times, but the drop away is rapid, so we felt safer and more relaxed in the pools",
        "Loved: The lagoon pool, incredible breakfasts, impreccable service and the most friendly staff with a 'nothing's a problem' attitude - always! Great food, great room, great location - and gorgeous beach",
        "The breakfast is served at Wedang Jahe restaurant which is surrounded by lotus pond",
        "Its a very well maintained pond and restaurant and the breakfast is as usual good and tasty",
        "Its located just next to the pool and provides very good view of the hotel overall",
        "But is perfect for Honeymooners and those looking to just sit and relax",
        "I had thought from reading previous reviews that some of these hotels had much better pools but we thought the Nusa Dua Beach Hotels swimming pools and grounds were much nicer",
        "Abundance of vegetation, squirrels, water, flowers, places for snacks and meals (though quite expensive compared to other hotels and especially restaurants in Bali Collection center)",
        "It is not firbidden, but there's simply no water to swim in",
        "The second minus - this is a hotel, even the resort consisting of 90% of Russians - which sometimes gets very tiring",
        "If you come here on a rainy season (December, January) be ready to experience lots of rain, but it will not bother you - especially in Nusa Dua Beach - since there's too much to admire, you breath is taken away by the beauty of the hotel and the island - and you simply do not notice there's extra water coming from above",
        "We arrived at the start of Sept and alot of our family and friends were also flying in from around the world and staying at the same resort as us so it was really important to us that we were made to feel special and we were",
        "(It had at least 20 rooms and its own private pool",
        "swimming pool etc",
        "and it is a must hotel for honeymooners",
        "Only one thing that we found was at the time as Australians the food by the pool is quite expensive, we paid about $55AUD for burgers by the pool one day my husband nearly died!!! : )",
        "We have just returned from our fourth stay at this fantastic resort",
        "The whole resort is beautifully maintained the food is sensational ,the Spa treatment are incredible so if your looking for a wonderful stay in Bali I can \"HIGHLY\" recommend NUSA DUA BEACH & SPA RESORT the only negative is having to leave BUT we will be back",
        "Pools: The hotel has 2 pools- main & lagoon",
        "The pool bar service is hit and miss- sometimes efficient and at times non existent",
        "The water is warm & very clear",
        "The grounds and facilities at the resort are wonderful, had everything we all needed to relax, and feel pampered",
        "That was a shame as it's pool was the only one open till 10PM",
        "Had a few $15 massages on the beach turn left on path and they are set up at the edge of the resort",
        "The only let down at all these resorts are the toasters are so slow",
        "The pool was nice, and was clean",
        "I only used the pool twice (we had a lot of rain on our trip) and experienced no problems",
        "Your pool towels were also on the sun lounges waiting for you, unlike the main pool where you have to give them some sort of token for a towel",
        "We recently stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort and had 4 nights there",
        "A supermarket which was handy to stock up on bottled water and bits n pieces",
        "Nusa Dua is a very nice resort area",
        "You can enjoy other spa facilities for the whole day, like the spa lap pool",
        "The hotel has 300+ rooms so this means that the pool will get quite crowded and it can be a problem trying to find a sunbed, you will get the obligatory towel reserving which is a pet hate of mine, however I had no qualms in removing towels that had been there for 30mins+ without an occupier anywhere to be seen and pinching it for myself ;-D",
        "We stayed in a deluxe room that faced the pool and the ocean",
        "The pool was nice though not large in comparision to some of the others on the strip such as the laguna or melia",
        "Unfortunately you had to be at the pool by 7am to secure beds which I found disappointing",
        "Despite this initial frustration, the grounds are beautiful and the pools are very nice",
        "It was just nice and refreshing to be in a resort not full of Brits!! (went to maldives last year and was like a little butlins!! lol)",
        "If i had to be sad the only down side to this resort is its beach and sea but having been to the maldives last year i think i will struggle to find beaches and seas like it is there!!",
        "One small usual problem which i didnt expect was that you have the same old problem of getting sunbeds round the pool, and as there was only about three familys of the usual suspects at this resort, (you know who i mean ) i guess this is now a world wide problem which cant be labelled at one particular nation",
        "A large TV and Unit, which incorporated our fridge fully stocked with water, soft drinks, alcoholic drinks and snacks",
        "Pools are OK but a bit shabby, with loads of noisy kids",
        "The best meals we had were at Ikan in the Westin resort next door",
        "The resort is 1st class all the way through",
        "This was our 4th visit to this Resort, and since on this ocassion we celebrated our wedding anniversary we decided to take the Honeymoon Package at the \"Palace Club Section\"",
        "Don't waste your time looking for other hotels, this great resort is not expensive and it offers top quality accomodation in Paradise !",
        "We stayed at this resort from July 2 until July 6",
        "We stayed with our 6 year old daughter and she enjoyed the pools and beach area",
        "Almost like a boutique resort",
        "We would no problem staying at the resort again",
        "While this is a very nice hotel, with a large pool and decent-sized rooms, I would not class it as one of the Leading Hotels of the World",
        "Plus points would be the pool and the spa was lovely",
        "We stayed at this beautiful resort for 9 days on our honeymoon",
        "This must be one of the most amazing resorts that we have ever stayed at, hence the reason for it being part of the \"Leading Hotels of the World\"",
        "Regarding the food, very expensive, but after all what do you expect from a world class resort",
        "The pool / beach area of the hotel was great, very spacious & not too crowded when we were there",
        "The pool area could do with a little attention as it is looking a bit worn (a few loose tiles, etc) however there is a lovely lawned sunbathing area just between the beach & pools, so you get the best of both worlds",
        "OK, this is a nice place, it has superb grounds, lovely pools and an impressive lobby",
        "If you happen to go a bit late to the pool or beach area, you have the chance of not finding a chair",
        "Pool, Beach front, and the Staff was excellent",
        "The water wasted on fountains and golf courses seemed ridiculous",
        "The only inconvenient, which is the same for all the Nusa Dua resorts : Nusa Dua is far from Bali's most interesting places, so my advice is : first travel across the island and then have a rest in the NDBHS !",
        "The pool is beautiful and we all had a brilliant time in the all the pools",
        "The sea is just 30 seconds walk away from the pool, and it is lovely and warm",
        "The lobby is clean, staff are friendly, hotel looked nice, pool is awesome etc",
        "In the end we changed to the Laguna (100m away, Westin between)",
        "It the room is important to you, we recommend going for the Laguna as a preference, failing that the Westin",
        "Lap pool is good though, quiet and possible to swim a km without trouble, nice to have sauna and steambath as well",
        "There are three pools at the hotel, one in the spa and then two by the main area of the hotel, both are gorgeous and very clean",
        "Overall I would absolutely recommend this hotel and resort, hardly any children there which was really nice, although it did have a good family friendly feel too",
        "A bit of advice about the pool loungers being scarce",
        "go to the spa pool",
        "We went for a couple service, which provides includes massages with Balinese creams, and the masseurs leave the two of you to enjoy in private the facilities, including a pool, a Jacuzzi and sauna",
        "The hotel resort is eventough a bit older and dated well maintained",
        "It's a classic \"pool and beach\"-resort where you can hang around the whole day or entertain yourself with the usual staff like ping-pong, beach-volley, jet-ski etc",
        "We found the pool area here much quieter than the main pool and sunbeds were always available",
        "It is a shame that you DO NOT get extra little touches like: flowers in room, chocolate on pillow or fruit by pool (unless you pay of course)",
        "Pools were fine (although busy) and beach ok",
        "Consider staying a few days at Kajane Mua Villas in UBUD which excellent",
        "You get your own Villa with small pool in lush garden setting with extras you don't get at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for $200 per night and much much better value spa ($25 US for 2 hours), food and drinks etc",
        "The two pools on the complex are not huge considering the number of rooms, but as the hotel seemed to be no more than 2/3 full whilst we were there we never found this a problem",
        "Having said that, a top tip is to go and find the Lap Pool over next to the Spa, which was almost empty compared to the main pool",
        "The hotel was nice enough to give us rooms with pool&seaview",
        "Beach is very nice but again seaweed in water makes swimming a bit difficult",
        "The 2 pools are very nice",
        "The pools and the beach were great",
        "To address some other reviewers comments, yes, Nusa Dua is a purpose built resort enclave that doesn't really give you a taste of the real Bali (although a walk through Tanjung Benoa or Bualu village will help in this respect)",
        "The hotel is located on a peninsula with several other major resorts (many of which appeared to be nicer)",
        "You may enjoy swimming in the pool and sitting by the beach, but know that you will not experience Bali",
        "The complex is large and we were a long way from the main pool area, but still the room was perfect, the view over the gardens was lush and we even had squirrels to watch!",
        "The pools were so nice and never felt noisy or crowded",
        "I booked the pool bale for just the 2 of us for a birthday celebration",
        "We have just returned from a 16 day stay in this resort",
        "The lap pool, spa facilities are very nice",
        "We mainly ate in the hotel and there are a number of restaurants including a lovely outdoor pizzeria by the main pool",
        "Also, we did not find the hotel, room or pool dated at all, like some other people wrote in their Tripadvisor review",
        "They just have to do one small change & that is to their pool which looks slightly outdated",
        "The pools are great and so is the garden",
        "We loved the spa pool",
        "Nusa Dua Beach Resort was simply amazing!",
        "I would recommend this resort to singles, families or couples - it is accomodating for all",
        "The resort is immaculately kept, the security guards ensure the environment feels safe, and the shopping centre is worth a visit too - the \"labels\" are amazing value",
        "The roundabouts have huge sculptures and water features on them",
        "This hotel is fine if you are happy staying in a huge resort that could be anywhere in the world",
        "The pool bar was also great, and the bartender very friendly",
        "The pool area was always busy but never felt busy",
        "The rooms are quite small, particularly compared to the Hilton, the beach wasn't that great, the pools were cold, the lobby not that spectacular",
        "480 rooms and in fact just one main pool with the size of a somewhat larger bathtub",
        "If the hotel were to be fully booked, one would have to run 'the German way' each morning to get a spot beside the pool",

        "3 females on holiday together and we all voted this the most attentive and relaxing resort ever",
        "the coach cost around 60US for a few hours, the driver will wait for you while you shop, remember to bargain while u shop there",
        "These are the sort of things that can and do go wrong when on holidays and this is the sort of place I want to be when travelling with children",
        "Also a special mention to the ever so friendly Exec",
        "Bali Collection is only a 10 minute walk",

        "The best solution is to engineer out the problem",
        "I think that this would also be a wonderful hotel for leisure purposes and am considering returning for a holiday some time in the future",

        "Location wise, it is far from city center and no shuttle provided, you need taxi in order to travel to other parts of Bali",

        "We experienced lots of the \"real\" Bali by taking tours and bought lots of local crafts from little villages rather than gift shops",
        "We understand that the part of Bali we stayed is not the real Bali and rather idealistic, but as holiday makers rather than travellers, we found it beautiful, safe, luxurious and romantic",
        "There were few people at the mall and the shops mainly junk although there was a supermarket, so for any better shopping or nightlife a taxi at about $8 each way would be required to Kuta",
        "So many thanks for another unforgettable holiday",
        "I forgot to review this hotel last year when I spent four days Lebaran holiday break in Bali",
        "Nice escape from the madness of the conference hotel, yet only max 10 minute walk",
        "I think if you want to have the real, cultural, Bali experience you should go to other areas of Bali as well, but Nusa Dua was very relaxing and also a very great part of our holiday",
        "It has absolutely every thing you need for a perfect holiday",
        "It is nothing like Seminyak or Kuta/Legian so if you are looking for loads of shopping, restaurants or party time its probably not the place for you",

        "We are planning another holiday to Bali in Late December and I can say with 100% confidence that we will be staying back at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa and will be recommending it to all we speak to",
        "The most important thing we like to stay here is becase it is just a few walks away from the Bali International Convention Center",
        "The stay did get better from there but while dressed like a 5star, this hotel is by no means one! The staff is kind of hit or miss - either fantastic or not! The rooms very standard & dark",

        "Head down to Ubund for some shopping",
        "Hotel was located at Nusa Dua where its neighbours were well-known international hotel chains",

        "Stay here if you like a quiet holiday with no threat of locals chasing you shouting \"hey Boss!\"",
        "The location is great in Nusa Dua and not crowed like Kuta",
        "I'd encourage you to spend time here, since it will be worth it for a quite vacation or even with your whole family",
        "Beautiful location with excellent security for those who worry about that kind of thing when travelling",

        "Location was perfect for getting about",
        "Now a warning - I went by myself to jet ski which is offered through the hotel but done through an off site company",

        "Location (7 out of 10)",
        "As for the location, yes it is a wee bit away from Bali Collection, but hey a 10 minute walk along the beach front, shuttle bus from the hotel or a cheap taxi - you are never far away",
        "We also visited the local village with it's shops and markets, even the local people were friendly",
        "Comparing meals poolside in a 4/5 star hotel to meals in a dodgy shopping centre where there are pictures on the menu (Bali Collection) is pretty silly in my opinion",

        "The location is excellent and only a short walk away from Bali Collection where you can find all the copy designer goods as you would find in Kuta but a little more expensive, and what I mean by more expensive in terms of Aussie dollars is minimal",
        "A terrible end to a beautiful holiday!!! Awful hotel, very unhelpful staff who knew nothing about their own facilities or the local area",

        "The local shops are located just outside the gate and the tourist strip at Tangung Benoa is close by",

        "Hotel location right on the beach, and a walk way path accessible to all the other hotels in the area",

        "There are lots of boutique shops appx 20 min walk from the hotel",

        "It is very extreme I was told because of the proximity to the equator",
        "They have many, many shops and restaurants",
        "Attractions:",
        "Go to Celuk to see the silversmiths create exquisite native jewelry- kind of expensive but worth it to have something so beautiful that was hand made",
        "Just look at the pictures! They will explain EVERYTHING!!!",

        "The grounds are beautiful and you can easily walk to local shopping, restaurants etc",
        "Unfortunatley time was limited but we did a lot of walking so that we could take in the sights",

        "Its big, well decorated and nice secure location",
        "For a romantic break, it was the perfect location",
        "There are amany restuarants in the hotel which we used early on in our holiday until we got our bearing and wondered down to the Bali Collection ( aka Bali Centre - 15 minute walk along the beach path) where there are many restuarants about half the price of the hotel; although I didn't think the hotel was that expensive compared top others we have stayed in",
        "the location is good for most areas to see the only thing i would say is that the food and drinks are a bit over priced but hey you are in a 5 star hotel",
        "The location is verz",
        "There is also the Bali Collection shopping centre in Nusa Dua which is great to visit for lunch and a bit of shopping, the hotel operates a free shuttle bus there every hour, or you can walk which will take about 15 mins",

        "All what I wanted just a clean room with the same location as we had at first",

        "walk / 5 min",
        "We had a fun time at this resort and would recommend this place to anybody looking forward to a relaxing and idyllic holiday",
        "You can also eat at the shopping complex called the Bali Collection",
        "To conclude we had a fantastic holiday and would certainly go back again, but not too soon as being a Travel Consultant I like to check out other destinations as well, so that I can advise my customers",
        "Annoying numbered men and women attempting to sell some junk for exorbitant prices (you have to haggle apparentely, but if you want to go shopping",
        "go to the shops)",

        "Local people set up shops along the bay if you walk far enough",
        "We spent 2 days just at the hotel and other days out sightseeing",
        "Probably because of the large number of guests (families & big groups), we observed a couple of conflicts but nothing major, and the holiday atmosphere remains",
        "We chose it because of the quiet location and the facilties, we were not disappointed",
        "Bali Collection Shopping Centre is also 10 minutes walk, with department store shopping and market stalls in a mall",
        "To stretch the budget, eat at the market or Bali Collection, pick up some drinks and food from either Hardy's Supermarket or at Bali Collection where you can also arrange tours, have massages and do some shopping",
        "We really had the most wonderful holiday and this hotel was definitely a contributing factor",

        "The location of the hotel is far off from all the major happenings of Bali",

        "Tips in hotel are not accepted, with very few exceptions",
        "I highly recommend the Hotel for those looking for calm, relaxation and a refreshing holiday",

        "I've just joined this site and had to review this hotel, it was August 05 when we stayed there but everything was outstanding, I truly hope it has stayed that way",
        "The hotel needs to be upgraded technologically, The Tv's were old and the in room wifi meant purchasing a pre paid wifi card from the gift shop",
        "The choice was average",
        "The location of all restaurants is good- dotted around the pool, near the beach front",
        "Ring: 772406 for free transport",

        "There was a Bali Collection Shopping Precinct which was a short stroll up the road (less than 10 minutes)",
        "Also, if you are going into Kuta at all, their supermarkets are significantly cheaper than the one in Nusa Dua, so buy all of your more expensive items whilst you are there",
        "There is no kiosk or convenient store within walkable distance",
        "The hotel is a 3+ to 4 star and and whilst had a great holiday if was to return to nusa dua area would stay at one of the others",
        "If you just want a relaxing holiday then Nusa Dua has that to offer and we found it perfect for our needs as if we wanted a quite night then we stayed at the hotel or if we where in the mood for a night out then in a taxi we would go!!",
        "Happy Holidays",

        "We went to the Bali Collection (lots of shops in an outside Mall) and made some purchases there but to be honest, it is about 2 or 3 times more expensive than the surrounding area because it mainly targets the tourists",
        "Find a local 7-11 or Circle K supermarket and stock up there",
        "We would recommend getting a private taxi/driver for the day who will take you on a tour of the island, avoiding busy traffic times and waiting at the attractions",
        "The Hotel has a great location in Nusa Dua",
        "The room was very clean with fruit basket and the smell of jasmine filled the air",

        "We were introduced to this hotel by a travel agent who gave rave reviews",
        "The hotel is situated in a convenient location, near the airport and within 30 minutes of Kuta",
        "But if you're looking for a quiet holiday away from the crowds, then this hotel is great with its private beach facility",
        "I found this site after we booked and was a little concerned about the reviews I was reading",

        "Altogether a very relaxing holiday, excellent accommodation, good food and superb service",
        "Since the hotel is quite far from city center and shopping center, I was quite often had a lunch and dinner in the resto but its again, not that yummi and quite expensive",
        "In terms of the location of the hotel, yes it is situated in a very sanitised complex which is very secure - you go through one checkpoint just to get into the Nusa Dua area and then another one to get into the hotel - but there is plenty of opportunity to book day trips out to other parts of the island if you want to experience the 'real' Bali",
        "All in all a very nice holiday in a lovely hotel",
        "We did have a lovely holiday just a shame about the operational/f&b of the hotel",

        "Six friends booked via Tradewinds and stayed seven nights out of a three week far east holiday,",
        "I think all the hotels are still experiencing low levels of trade since the bombing in 2002",
        "We caught taxis into Kuta every day to eat / shop (don't do it in Nusa Dua), then went on to stay in Ubud",
        "We had purchased a package through Asian Affair Holidays - an incredible deal",
        "We spent the rest of our vacation at the Ritz in Jimbaran",
        "Also based on several reviews on this site we had high expectations",
        "We would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a relaxing and self-indulgent holiday",
        "It is well worth a holiday",

        "We stayed for 10 days as part of a luxury deal offer which was great value, however what was not mentioned in the deal was the fact that your meal selection for lunch and dinner was cut down to a third of the menu on purchasing, which was extremely limiting and repetitive, especially over a 10 day period",

The pool area was lovely - especially enjoyed the poolside bar and restaurants, also the daily pool aquaerobics",
        "(Palace Club DEFINATELY worth the extra cost!)",
        "(2 x Palace Club rooms)",
        "as you come into the property, the candi bentar (split gates) together with the Balinese architecture make this feel a little more in touch with its location than the other resorts along Nusa Dua",
        "There was no construction we found going on",
        "The rooms are balinese style and a little musty but goes",
        "The building perhaps was a little bit old, but it was well maintained and clean",
        "The architecture retained a distinctive Balinese feel to it",
        "The Balinese people and their lovely smiles and friendly and relaxed nature just makes you relaxed too",
        "It is a bit of a con to get you to buy into a timeshare so dont fall for it!!",
        "Luxury hotel with everything that we call heaven",
        "Hopefully they will keep the Balinese design, atmosphere & ambience",
        "This is the main reason I kept going back and try to avoid modern / minimalist style hotels in Bali",
        "The Palace Club was just amazing every day with changing food and the service from the friendly staff was so nice I had a tear in my eye saying goodbye",
        "The Palace Club (like a corporate club) was excellent with the highlight no doubt being the excellent staff, nothing was too much trouble for them and they always had a warm greeting and smile on arrival",

        "Will choose this hotel and Palace Club facilities again",
        "Excellent hotel in every aspect! Your stay there will be memorable as a tropical heaven surrounds you and service is more than perfect! If I was about to repeat my journy in Bali, I would certainly choose again Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa",
        "The standards rooms aren't that great, we quickly upgraded to the palace suite, which was nicer but still didn't have that \"wow\" factor",
        "We decided to treat ourselves to a Palace Room and were thrilled with the room and value the Palace Club offers you",
        "Not brand new but very well kept",
        "Sadly, both the Indonesian and the multi purpose Asian - Maguro - are a letdown",

        "The only other downside we found was the wifi only being available in the lobby",

        "No evidence of bugs--did see a wee gecko one night, which may be why the bugs were missing",
        "You can get several miles in within the Nusa Dua area without too much trouble, although it can be a bit tricky to follow it around a few places where it appears to end at fences or buildings",
        "All-in-all, I'd recommend this place, unless you know you'd rather have a more modern environment with less character",
        "We were upgraded to a palace room this time and were made to feel like royalty",
        "It is a large complex and was not very busy at this time",
        "30 PM and suddenly the balcony's light were off",
        "Been 2 yrs since our last visit to the palace suites and some of the staff still remembered us!! I think i have our super blonde son to thank for that",
        "Wife got sick during trip, cannot imagine more care what she received from Palace club staff, luckly with doctor's help she get weel within few days and we could spend lovely Easter and also have nice dinner at Raja's, quality and friendliness was again to top, but please change menu sometime, it would be pleasure for use how visit often",
        "Actually durning palace club cocktails other visitors told us same, good service but hurry afterwods and have to fill comment card",
        "There is free wi-fi in the lobby (although not widely publicised",
        "The reason why I would give it four stars instead of five is that this is a large commercial hotel and with that it loses some of the authentic charm that Bali has",
        "and it was always a pleasure to return to the peaceful surroundings",
        "In conclusion this hotel has all the necessary components to provide a peaceful and tranquil escape from the everyday stresses and strains we all endure!",

        "My only complaint about this hotel was that it was just a bit too quiet",

        "Having stayed in the Palace Club at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel on many occasions and always loving it, I was slightly disappointed this time around",
        "Afternoon tea was served \"English style' on a 3 tier stand, and other than the dry sandwiches, was also good",
        "I phoned at 9am, was welcomed warmly as a returning quest and checked in at the Palace Wing by 10",
        "Also, if your visit is during monsoon season, you might want to bring the complimentary umbrella in the room for your Bali collection visit",
        "The construction was annoying, because it was noisy and one had to take detours around the work, but that's understandable",
        "The little touches throughout our stay is what will have me return time over",
        "The overall design of the hotel is not only incredibly clever- its something special that I will remember for a lomg time to come",
        "We booked a palace club room for ourselves and deluxe rooms for our sons",
        "anyway we still managed to get our sleep later in the day, but some others would possibly go for a separate villa or at least an upgrade to the room (palace club or whatever its called)",
        "Now, there are a couple of things that should be addressed but they did not take our enjoyment of the place away",
        "I would definitely stay again, though I would upgrade to the Palace club suites",
        "Bit crowed but have to understand have 100's of room guest",
        "It also looks a bit tired and needs renovating",

        "Sometimes it takes a bit getting the message across about what you want, but then they will deliver",
        "I read another review that commented that this hotel had no character",
        "The architecture of this hotel and the gardens, the dress of the staff all scream BALI",
        "You can see that is not modern but it recently went though a major renovation that made it up",
        "The infrastructure of this hotel is truly magnificent and built from quality materials withstanding the test of time, with Balinese influence throughout, very nice indeed",
        "Stayed in Palace Club again service always friendly and welcoming",
        "Simply stunning open air feel lobby with authentic Bali statues and gardens",

        "We stayed in a Palace Club Suite for 10 nights and enjoyed our time at the hotel",
        "Beautifullly respectful staff, gorgeous tropical gardens, pools to dies for and a resort with a mixture of old Balinese style and beachy new paradise",

        "the palace club package is great if you like to eat and drink! All the restaurants are great",
        "Big sprawling hotel that lacks charm",
        "It's a shame as they had many vacancies and still have - I booked a Superior and they still have plenty of Palace Club Suites available",

        "We have just returned from our third visit to this hotel, staying Palace Club, some rooms and suites of which have just been completely refurbished",

        "It's worth it to upgrade to the palace rooms so you get free drinks & food at the happy hour",
        "Their attention detail and all the little touches added up to an amazing stay",
        "A comfortable hotel with traditional design nestled in one of the best location at Nusa Dua",
        "As I said above the only detraction was the renovations that were occurring",
        "It's a building site, ugly and overly expensive for the service you get!!! There are so many hotels in this area that you can choose a lot better",
        "Half the hotel is under construction and our room faced it all",
        "I would recommend a stay here once all the construction is finalised",
        "This hotel will take your breath away with the structural and natural beauty! We HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a get-away vacation, wedding/honeymoon, or anything!",
        "The hotel itself is incredibly beautiful, when you drive up the driveaway along the architecture blows your mind, the food is fantastic, the rooms are clean and the staff are the best I have come across anywhere in the world",

        "The hotel itself is very pretty, more Balinese style than others around it",
        "For my taste it is too isolated and expensive area; you will not get to know Bali there",
        "Beautiful Balinese \"gates\" as you approach the hotel, and a wonderful large, and more traditional style foyer",
        "I have only ever stayed in a Palace Club room, so can only comment on that",
        "I think what really makes Palace Club are the wonderful staff",
        "I highly recommend the Palace Club, and compared to other resorts, probaly the most affordable club on offer",

        "I say stay here just for the more interesting design of the hotel if you're looking for a resort in the Nusa Dua area",
        "A special mention to the staff at the customer relations desk in the lobby",
        "Booked a suite in the palace club section and well worth the extra expense",
        "Other areas of hotel were undergoing refurbishment but we weren't disturbed by this at all",
        "Other reviews suggest this hotel feels like a complex and isn't really the real Bali and I'd agree",
        "I choose this hotel after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor, let me say this was a very good decision, the hotel is stunningly beautiful and is made in traditional bali style, I had booked the trip through a travel agent and the trip was very well organized we stayed there for 5 days from 15th to 19th Dec , the hotel staff was friendly and smiling always ready to help, I just have two complaints first the lift outside our room was not working so we had to walk a long way and second the hotel beach was not clean but I think that was out of the hotels control as it was rainy season, lastly with the ever increasing flow of Indians the hotel could use an Indian counter at the breakfast buffet, if you are going to bali stay here, bali is amazing and beautiful it has beaches, volcanoes, temples, palaces, culture, good food and friendly people",
        "However, now that the hotel has come under the ownership of the Sultan of Brunei, it is being renovated to bring it up-to-date without sacrificing its Balinese style",
        "Stayed at Nusa Dua in the Palace Suite",
        "the works",
        "There are the positive and less positive elements that are for me important to talk about",
        "We've stayed in palace rooms and deluxe rooms - do palace if you want the extras, or don't and buy your cocktails at happy hour at the beachfront Chess Bar instead, and spend the extra on local cuisine - this was our preference",
        "Rooms are fairly similar, palace a bit larger with lovely garden views",
        "Has an amazing charm to it",
        "I can't wait to see the renovations to the Palace Club when we go back next year",
        "My partner and I had the best time and look forward to taking our family back next year to stay in the Palace Club",

        "It was a nice hotel in a Balinese style",
        "We stayed in a Deluxe room and it had beautiful bali charm and was spotless",
        "The open air lobby with koi ponds and lush green immaculate grounds, private beach, two pools and several wonderful restaurants make it so you almost don't ever want to leave the property",
        "The only place where you feel the luxury of high class hotel is in the lobby",
        "Unfortunately, it's currently under renovation",
        "The rooms are very nice, they maintain some Balinese style so are pleasant to stay in - most have balconies which is another plus",
        "My son who is 15 asked if the hotel was an old palace, it does have feeling of old Bali grandeur about it, I liked it as although it is an old hotel it still feels very much like a Bali hotel, some of the newer hotels feel as if you could be anywhere in the world",
        "I didn't go in swimming though, as I saw some garbage around",
        "The hotel is not of modern design but more traditional asian",
        "The hotel, albeit a bit old, looks fantastic",
        "Also, it gets a bit crowded on week-ends",
        "Small details but the details do add up! We stayed in a standard room and found especially the bathroom to be very dated with a shower head propped over a bath and a nylon shower curtain",
        "The overall hotel would benefit from a more attention to detail and using the 'Palace Club' as a 'standard'",
        "A bit outdated, but fine",
        "Booked 2 palace club rooms for the family inc 2 adult kids age 19 and 17",
        "Lovely hotel and definately worth booking the palace club rooms",
        "I personally chose this hotel for its Balinese design and the beach",
        "The resort itself has beautiful architecture and many things to see",
        "They have a 'Palace Club' section were I think you might have to reserve to use the ones in that area, but you must go by and see them!!",
        "Go to Batuan to see art",
        "We stayed in a Palace club room and we were treated so well from the moment we arrived",

        "They started an probable finished renovation",
        "The chaiselongues are a little bit tired and used, maybe they will consider a change",
        "They looked a bit fresher",
        "This was a bit annoying",
        "Originally mainly farmland and mangroves, it has in the last two decades become the hotspot for many 5 star luxury resorts",
        "the rooms in palace club were loveley and the palace club blimey you could get away with not spending a penny if you wanted there is so much food !!",
        "all in all we will go back to bali and we will stay here even though we drank and visited a lot of the more modern hotels the NDBH is like bieng in a palace in the days of the raj",
        "The hotel has a large lobby area which leads through to the centre which is all pools and restaurants and surrounded by the rooms either side",
        "The lobby bar is what it is but does serve a mean cocktail",
        "Hidden gem, best ever hotel with incredeble luxeury",

        "we had booked a standard room which was lovely and more than adequate, however as it was a special occasion we enquired about an upgrade and after looking at a few rooms, we upgraded to a palace room for $20 a night",
        "we did not have access to the palace lounge as we paid suck a low rate for the upgrade which i was disappointed about but soon got over it! the room was very clean with a turn down service every night",

        "We married in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel in June",
        "We walked & rode up & down the beach several times & inspected a couple of other resorts along the strip",
        "The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa was very nice overall, and a very good value compared to some of the wildly expensive (yet not that much nicer) hotels in Nusa Dua / Jimbaran Bay",
        "A previous reviewer stated that the beach was dirty, but what they didn't say was that the Indian Ocean is quite rough and there is rubbish that is washed up on the coastline in the morning, (like everywhere else) but the hotel have beach cleaners who clear up every last bit of this",
        "I scanned through a large number of hotel reviews in Nusa Dua Beach area before deciding on this property and had absolutely no regrets about my choice",
        "I must say that besides , Westin and Laguna, which also occupied the same stretch of beach , NDBH offered the best beachfront with spotless white sand and most importantly ,a large number of clean beach loungers",
        "One of the pool even had water deep enough for diving",
        "We did not find the beach touts too annoying as they were not very pesky and would disappear quietly once you politely decline to purchase things from them",
        "One is the classical one, with comfortable sunbeds around it, and it has a poolbar in the swimmingpool",
        "The other is a \"fake beach\" which must be perfect for people travelling with children",

        "Normally I dont do anything like this but on this occasion I believed that I should write something about the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa",
        "The stretch of beach where the resort is located accommodates 5-6 other 4-5 star nice resorts, but they are all south of it, and they dont benefit as much from the sea breeze as it does, which is very important on a hot & humid Bali afternoon with a beer or cocktail in hand",
        "There are the locals on the beach (they are not allowed to enter the resort property) every day, all day, to barter with for imitation Rolex watches and Bolle sunnies, baik linen & clothing and so on, which is a fun experience",
        "We booked at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel after reading the reviews and were very happy we did",
        "Walking along the beach in the evening we noticed that some of the neighbouring hotels were livelier in terms of night life, but we actually preferred the Nusa Dua for being quiet",
        "We liked Nusa Dua Beach hotel and Nikko Bali hotel the most out of all the offered hotels in travel agency catalogues",
        "They gave us a room that was nice and had a good view but was on the farthest side from the beach",
        "The sandy beach is lovely with a view of one of Bali's volcanoes in the distance on one side and with the beach streching out to the right leading to one of the two peninsulas (a romantic evening walk)",
        "The hotel offers beach clean beach towels and sunbeds for free to all hotel guests",
        "The only thing we didnt like about the beach was that during most of the afternoon there was low tide",
        "Overall, I would highly recommend the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel",

        "Except for the beach, which was about average, everything was just excellent",
        "Wonderful ppol and beach orientation - vs",

        "We stayed at the Nusa dua beach resort for 9 nights at the end of April in the Palace Club rooms",
        "it has the most amazing proximity to the beach and a lovely lake in they compound where there were ducks all day long and the kids loved it",
        "I asked a colleague in Jakarta to recommend a hotel and he suggested Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa and we loved the place",
        "The beach is awesome - clean and not at all crowded",

        "I would highly recommend Nusa Dua Beach Hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing, sumptuous stay!",
        "Nusa Dua beach resort and others within this area are within easy access to Kuta, but if you want relaxation and quiet, we fully recommend",
        "We went to Jimbaran Bay for dinner one evening, very pricey for what you get, but very smokey and could not see our food as too dark on the beach tables",
        "We were taken to a 3rd floor family room, which had an incredible view over the pool; and glimpes of the gorgeous beach",
        "The beach front has good arrangement in case you want to just sit and relax",
        "The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was perfect for us, I had requested a room near the pool with the travel agent and when we checked in I asked if we had been given one",
        "The kids loved the lagoon swimming pool with the sand edges , you walk into the pool as you would the beach and the sand goes for about 10 feet then it very gradually gets deeper just like the beach",
        "We walked along the beach path up towards the point and looked at all the other hotel grounds and swimming pools",
        "Some of the other hotels looked more expensive and perfect but they were also much more crammed together, the grounds of the Nusa Dua Beach are larger with more grass and trees than cement and buildings, also lots of squirrels which the kids loved feeding",
        "If you walk around the point there is a lovely beach with no buildings and a bit of surf, we didn't check it out properly but it looked great and hardly anyone there",
        "Of all the hotels that lie on the same laguna strip adjacent to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, - Westin, Melia Bali, Laguna - this is the one retaining pure traditions of Bali, best beach (the biggest of all the hotels and the only one with most sun, unlike the closest hotels) and huge territory",
        "If you are looking for a hotel with plenty of activities - then you might want to try sth different, since Nusa Dua Beach - like the entire Bali island - is a place to relax, not to make extra movements, not to watch time and to be extremely active - of all the activities on the activity list in the pool area none was taking place",
        "The hotel is beautifully located with a lovely beach and nice lawns",
        "We quite liked the restauarant on the beach at a neighbouring property, I guess laguna resorts",
        "gr8 beach",

        "Beach: Generally the beach was poor but at times it looked lovely",
        "Massages are available to the left of the beach as you walk out of the hotel",
        "The Melia seems to attract a lot more hawkers on their stretch of beach",
        "( you can get cheap massarges on the beach but never tried )",
        "We chose Nusa Dua Beach Resort from all the good comments on Tripadvisor and new it would be very relaxing so thanks everyone",
        "takes 10 minutes to walk from the reception to the beach",
        "We were at the beach end of the resort so the long treck to the spa was not an option as it is at the front of the property",

        "We stayed in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our anniversary",
        "We tried snorkelling in Nusa Dua beach with hawkers in the beach",
        "The beach is not the best and to be honest we didn't venture onto it once, but as we had recently been in the maldives this may have just been me being a bit picky",
        "If you are a diver then I would recommend the dive centre",
        "The first half of our trip we stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel (was part of a really great package deal with Asia Luxe/Singapore Airlines)",

        "My family stayed at Nusa Dua Beach hotel on 31 January 2008 for a short vacation trips",
        "Afterwards you can take a great romantic walk along the beach path too to wear it off!",

        "beach and pool was also great",
        "the only downside is that you have to get to the beach or pool early to reserve a beach/pool bed so I do think that they need to look into getting a few more but that is just a small niggle, About 10 mins walk from the hotel is the Bali Collection a shopping complex with some nice shopping and lovely restaurants that are very cheap to eat in and the food is great, this is all to cater for the tourist so you do need to get out of your hotel and see the proper Bali, i can recommend the mountain bike trip 2 hours downhill so hardly any peddeling and you go through the bali villages and see the children, schools, paddi fields and end at the elephant sanctury this is a wonderful day",
        "The pool area has been renovated in the last 3 years and the beach is clean and not a lot of hawkers ( expected in this part of the world though",

        "For a couple, looking for a romantic beach vacation, Jimbaran or Legian are nicer",
        "The Nusa Dua Beach area was completely manufactured and isolated for tourists, so if you want western conviences (there is even a Starbucks in walking distance at the Bali Collection) and safety this is the place",

        "We were really able to unwind and enjoy ourselves in Nusa Dua",

        "The hotel is surrounded by stunning tropical gardens and the views of the Indian Ocean are incredible",
        "We stayed at a deluxe ocean view room which was stylish, spacious and, like the rest of the hotel, full of traditional Balinese character",
        "A very good stay here, we actually went August 2012 but won't let me backdate it",
        "We loved the many nights sitting near the waves with our toes in the sand having meals with close freinds at Chess bristro",
        "Would go back any time",
        "Beautiful shaded grounds, plenty of sun lounges and great restaurants and bars",
        "Had to cut down towards the end",
        "The walk to the shoreline is short but fairly steep and the presence of a reef close to shore means that you can paddle in the ocean but a proper swim is not really an option",
        "bathroom and terrace) and the inability to swim in the ocean",
        "Sitting there watching the sun disappear behind the palm trees while squirrels played and ducks paddled past on their way to the nearby pond while sipping an apple martini or mojito or daiquiri was divine",
        "As noted by another reviewer the pools were very warm and not refreshing but the ocean was handy and cooler and clean",
        "Constant landscapers on duty -people raking the sand/ picking up leaves to keep the yards and beach tidy which you can imagine leaves the place immaculate!",

        "We had a really blissful week together there and talked about a bigger family gathering at some stage down the track",
        "You can eat dinner right on the beach which is a gorgeous thing to do but pick up some insect repellent from the shop first because there are little sand flies or something that can be mildly annoying once the sun goes down",
        "But this place would make an amazing getaway for a week and if I can bring my family to Bali, this is definitely where we will stay",
        "It was the best stay of our 3 weeks in Bali & will be back next year!!! On behalf of the LONSDALE family - thank-you to all for absolutely EVERYTHING & making our stay with you FANTASTIC!!!! See you next year!",

        "was amazed when I got to view the baby turtles entering the sea for the first time",
        "This hotel was suited 100% to relaxing in the sun as a couple or in small groups",
        "Not worth the $ you spend for at the end",
        "Sadly the beach is blighted by plastic garbage like most Bali beaches , although the cleaners rake up the bags, bottles, and other rubbish ,the next day more just washers up from the ocean, the cleaners bury the garbage in the sand, not ideal, the main solution is too stop garbage getting into the ocean",
        "The beach is lovely as the trees are growing in the sand and beautiful to sit under",
        "I travel to Bali last March ~~~",
        "We stayed here in Jan 2013 for a week and what a week we had it was wonderful",

        "We had stayed there nine years ago and enjoyed it then , we were not disappointed this time",
        "Spent one week there with family",
        "It probably helped that we arrived at the very start of the season (April 2013) so it was very quiet",
        "Overall we loved our time at this hotel",
        "Enjoy your time at the Nusa Dua and Bali!",
        "There's so many options that you could spend a week there",
        "It really bothered me to see the beach cleanser sweeping up the grass and trash and burying it in the sand",
        "My 1st time stay here in Nusa Dua",
        "Not a good start at all",
        "Good for a quick dip and a lie in the sun",
        "Four night stay in first week of March 2012",
        "And the sea food combo by the pool or beach,doesn't get any better",
        "Didn't go into Nusa Dua",
        "I would definitely go back for another weekend getaway!",
        "We had a wonderful time in Bali",
        "There were several restaurants of different cuisine but the cheers bar had a eating area right on the beach which was a beautiful place to eat as the sun went down, with a walk along the beach after dinner",
        "We had a 4 night stay in this resort in summer 2012",

        "Visited June 2012",
        "We loved swimming at the beach and laying on the chairs watching over the sea",
        "The only bad thing was the constant rainy weather",
        "The hotel is right by the beach so if you don't feel like pool time, go straight ahead and fool around in the ocean",
        "Stayed here for 3 weeks and loved every second of it! Kids had a blast! Very family friendly",
        "We had a very nice stay for two weeks in December",
        "We were married at this hotel in April 2008 and have returned twice since",
        "We booked a premier room and have ocean and pool views",
        "I suppose if you just want your kids to have a swim in the pool and to get some sun, then it's OK, but a Balinese experience it ain't, and as Western experiences go it was unpleasant",
        "If and when we get to this part of the planet again will make an effort to come for a second stay",
        "Evening coctails (2) each and appys (6) were some of the best I have had in a long time",

        "It was paradise!",
        "Meals at Chess on the beach also great and was lovely just to sit in the cool breeze and see the ocean",
        "This is my third time at this hotel",
        "Another time a sand castle competititon was scheduled, but guess what, only my daughter was there - no prizes for guessing what she spent the next hour doing",
        "I felt I was the most important person on earth!",
        "whether it be for a weekend or 6 1/2 weeks (like me)",
        "MY HEAVEN ON EARTH",
        "We asked for a pool view which also included view of the sea",
        "its dead after sun, so people wanting to have good nightlife must be ready to travel at least 40min to nearest spot \"Kuta\", where nightlife was actually good",
        "We now happily choose to stay there EVERY time we visit Bali",
        "Right after a big celebration, my husband and I had a little detour to Bali island",
        "Can't seem to stop people holding the sun lounges but as we were out there early and stayed there, it didn't seem to bother us but gave us something to watch when people either came back or trying to find one",
        "In July 2011 we stayed in the Nusa Dua Hotel for the 4th time",
        "Believe me, when it is time to leave, you just want to hide and stay longer",
        "For someone who is extremely fussy I really can't fault this hotel - it was the perfect resort for a relaxing, stress free holiday in the warm sun!",
        "There are nothing in Nusa Dua, but the weather is pretty nice, whole day in breezy and comfortable",

        "First time in Bali and weren't sure what to expect",
        "It was my 3rd time in Bali, and we absolutely enjoyed the time we have spent in this hotel",

        "My husband and I married here in September 2010",
        "you first have to differentiate between the hotel and the rest of the island",
        "They start with 250 $ and can end up selling it for 20 $ after wasting your time and just constantly lying to you",
        "I DONT RECOMMEND THIS ISLAND OR COUNTRY AT ALL",
        "Great choise to spend a week few years ago",
        "I stayed at this hotel in September 2011",
        "You lay out in the sun, but cannot get in the water because of sea urchins",

        "Consequently - we are going back again for March break",
        "Nusa Dua itself is not very busy, which is sometimes exactly what you want!",
        "We stayed here for 4 night on Mar 2011",
        "Main pool was excellent but I didn't like the \"beach\" pool as the sand was very stony and hurt my feet",
        "Architecturally it us the only true Balinese hotel in this region",
        "ocean not really swimmable",
        "We asked for a babycrib from the hotel since we were also bringing our 9 months old son",

        "We even had a chance to see the sun rise at the early morning with clear sky (luckily)",

        "How can be such a property on earth",
        "* many seaweeds in the sea that made swimming not very confortable (but similar to all beaches of the area)",
        "* Nusa dua is a place quite far from the rest of the island",
        "Bali is the best place I've visited since a long time",

        "I am returning to Bali on 29 August and cant wait to stay at",
        "The grounds are immaculate and the stretch of beach that the hotel is build on is lovely for relaxation and swimming (with coral shoes, we are not used to the sand, the sea sand in South Africa is soft and firm)",

        "they just laugh, and said, ONLY when u are there, then u will know what is called \"PARADISE ON EARTH\"",
        "The hotel has its own private beach, with sun chair, facing the sea",
        "I was on my honeymoon and therefore I informed the hotel to try and make it a little special for me by at least providing me with a room with sea view, now the irony is that only the standard rooms and palace club rooms in this hotel has sea view and Deluxe rooms have only garden view, so I had to downgrade to standard room for better views, which was not pleasant at all (coz I booked a Deluxe room earlier), the room furnishing is good 8-9 years old, also the Tv is not a LCD Tv which is a standard in every 5 Star these days, also they do not have a DVD player and but they can provide you with one for a rental of US $15 per day, which is really not required , there is no free wifi and they charge US $ 100 for one day ( A little less at the lobby area ) which is Insane, the food is overpriced but very decent, the breakfast was average , if you want to have your own liquor by the beach they will charge you additional US $ 30 per person for it as corkage charges ,also I would especially like to mention the photographer here who is stationed near the pool area , who was suppose to click one complimentary picture for every guest, regarding which we were so happy as we really wanted some pictures of us in the hotel as our camera was destroyed due to water a day before only, after clicking few pics we requested him to give us the rest of the pics in a portable drive which I was carrying so that we can take back some more memories with us , to our disbelief he charged us US $100 to transfer those few pictures which he otherwise would have deleted, to which we had to say no eventually as it was too much for a mere transfer of few pics the whole episode was so surprising and sad for us as we already told him our problem of not having a camera any more , I believe they are looking for opportunities to extract money for every service they provide you, which are standard in any 5 Star hotels you go to these days and are more or less complimentary , which means except your breakfast and stay there is a price list available for you for any and every service you ask for in this hotel",
        "Generally, I have good time",
        "During european summer the day is short in Bali, 6 pm is already dark, but is definitelly worthy to visit Bali and Singapore",
        "We stayed here during October",
        "A good job then, that distances on the island are small",
        "i stayed here from the 1st to the 11th of october and i can confidently say if ther are any reviews saying anything other than its fantastic i would be baffled ?",
        "This is just our opinion, but compared to other hotels in the Far East and Indian Ocean it compares very favourably with those in the same price bracket",
        "Stayed here with the whole family for a whole week",
        "There was a lot of yelling from the shore, but no help! We had to allow ourselves to be washed up against the rocky breakwater and then climb out",
        "My family and I ( with 2 kids , aged 11 & 12 ) have just returned from a 6-day stay in early June at this wonderful hotel",
        "i could go on and on about this hotel as we had a such a memorable time",
        "The Nusa Dua section of the island of Bali is almost like a \"gated community\" in itself",
        "Note that the beach out the front of the resort is not a surfing beach as such, but the water is clear and the sand is yellow and clean",
        "We really knew that we had made the right choice, however, after my wife had a bad fall while we were exploring elsewhere on the island",
        "Overall, we were very pleased with the Nusa Dua and highly recommend it",
        "We married at Nusa Dua in April",
        "We stayed a week this year , but next year plan to stay 2-3",
        "You can walk the beach and end up at a local temple overlooking the sea",
        "The beach is not clean though and you cant actually go in the sea",
        "The former - you can feel very well the low and high tides, the low tide means - you can't swim",
        "After a lot of careful research I picked this hotel as the location for our wedding because it was one of the few places I could find where we could get married and see the sea, which was my dream",
        "more of that later) and we had a fantastic view of the sea and the hotel",
        "We spent a week at this wonderful hotel",
        "We can recommend a trip to Jimbaran, get some seafood while watching the sun go down",

        "The hotel had employed a professional from the UK to train the bar staff on cocktail making (the espresso martinis were amazing!) The drinks were a little expensive but what some people fail to realise is that this is a five star resort and it is expensive to drink in a lot of places in Bali as they have to import (a bottle of Jacobs creek in a local supermarket set me back $70)",

        "Nusa Dua is definitely the \"other side\" of Bali",
        "the more authentic side of Bali",
        "Just make sure that, if you come to Bali, you don't spend all your time just in Nusa Dua -- spend more of your time in Ubud!",
        "we also ate at Raja's which was one of our fave meals and we ate at the chess bar",
        "it was quiet at night and we tended to sit at the bar enjoying the sea breeze, slipping drinks and listening to live band",
        "There are also hawkers on the beach to sell you fishing or snokeling trips on their boats that are moored out front, or to sell you jet-ski rides",
        "Our wedding went without and a hitch and the location was stunning, we used the wedding bale on the beach front, which was surprisingly private",

        "This happens either in the first or the second half of the day",

        "After staying at the Puri Santrian in Sanur and the Alila in Ubud this place was a real let down",
        "The Sushi bar on the beach is great for lunch as it the pizza bar",
        "On the negative side, some of the hotel's facilities are rather old",
        "One of the best bits is the bar in the middle of the pool, you can swim up to it anytime of the day or evening and have a cold relaxing Bintang! We ate at the hotel half the time, and the food was very good although quite expensive",
        "The Chess bar is a lovely place to sit and watch the world go by",
        "The staff all over the hotel were unfailingly polite, and all spoke good English, so we had aboslutely no problems on that front",
        "this is the right spot",

        "Finally, as mentioned, this hotel has a traditional Bali feel",
        "If you're looking for an authentic Balinese experience you're probably not going to find it here, but if you want a bit of resort luxury then this is for you",

        "The Spa facilities were amazing, we had massages every second day and felt like royalty throughout the experience",
        "They are helpful, but seemed to lacked training and coaching for that 5 star touch, especially comparing to our experience visiting Laguna hotel and Sofitel, the service gap is particular apparent in Front Office and F&B",
        "It offers pure authentic Bali atmosphere and ambiance with a modern touch, they seem perfectly manage n maintain the whole hotel years after years and gives a top-notch stay experience n services",
        "It was the low season so the hotel wasn't at capacity which I am sure contributed to my good experience",

        "We had an amazing stay and loved every second of the experience",
        "I'm not normally a fan of exclusive areas developed at the expense of poorer areas in a 3rd world county and normally stay in the Legian area for a more genuine Balinese experience",
        "This is more a review of my experience rather than the hotel itself",
        "I would recommend a stay if in the Nusa Dua area, a much quieter experience than the Kuta/Legian areas",
        "One thing I will pull the hotel up on",
        "A few things I could pick on:",
        "I was staying here for work, actually",

        "What we paid for and what we go were two different things",
        "Of course, being the first hotel on the Nusa Dua stretch (the property's been around for 30 years), it does not offer the same experience as the newer chains that occupy the same stretch now",
        "However, the hotel offers a true Balinese experience, the staff are gracious and ever willing to help, the buildings and rooms have a charm of its own (don't worry, they're all clean) and the grounds are just gorgeous",

        "To us this hotel is \" Bali \" and will now no longer stay anywhere else , we can't speak highly enough of this hotel , the staff , facilities and general feel of the hotel are great , we have been to Bali 7 times and stayed in Kuta , Legian and Seminak but staying in Nusa Dua( and this hotel ) is different kind of Bali experience",
        "For families with kids the large complex with direct access to a clean beach offers almost everything and is a sort of paradise -- like others before (check other recent reviews), you will be delighted from this unique hotel experience",
        "From the time we checked in the hotel gave us a wonderful experience",
        "All of them were perfect for different things",

        "You need to do something about this",
        "This experience did leave a sour taste in my mouth but we were unaware until we returned to the hotel and our guide wanted to know why we weren't picked up",

        "Room rate was at USD 180 which I thought was alright given my good experience, recent good reviews and the fact that it is a 5-star resort",
        "My friends definitely enjoy the experience and trust me, staying at a beautiful resort such as the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel definitely gives your Bali experience a good boost",

        "Our whole experience of Bali was amazing",
        "There was something for everyone from local, asian, continental, american and british",
        "A good idea if u want to ease into the indonesian experience but know that u're an expensive cab ride from most activities",
        "Given that size, It could turn into something practical and lively",
        "Keep up the good work",
        "We have no experience of the Palace club, but if it is better than the regular hotel, wow",

        "All in all a lovely experience",
        "Having stayed on three separate occasions in Bali at the Grand Bali Hyatt, the Intercontinental and the Kamandala, and on our outward trip this time at Poppies, where the standards at all were excellent, our experience at the Nusa Dua Beach bore no resemblance to any of those hotels, nor, indeed, to any of the numerous hotel we have ever stayed at in South East Asia",

        "This being our first experience of a Resort Hotel I think we were pleasantly surprised,",

        "Go at least once in your lifetime",
        "You could say the experience is different every time",
        "During check in and check out the experience was bad",
        "Not worthy of a five star rating due the experience and quality of accomodation and overall experience",
        "Very open, clean, and the perfect temperature",
        "Driving through the streets of Bali was an incredible experience, seeing the houses, shops and culture of these beautiful people was extrodinary and is important for all traveling to Bali to experience as this is the \"REAL\" Bali",

        "Great value",
        "Vouchers in your welcome pack were handy to reduce your bills at the restaurants and bars",
        "There are a few restaurants and bars that we tried, but it should be improved compared with the price that they were charging",
        "the prices were OK, the problem is the add taxes that brings the final price 40% more expensive of what is written",
        "There are very nice places outside of the hotel where we could have a better meal, and with a much better price and quality",
        "The attention to detail and the amount of maintenance that is involved in keeping this place tidy is outstanding",

        "Your fare will be half the price",
        "Not sure if the hotel had notified Expedia of this but someone should have let us know that we wouldn't be getting what we booked",
        "If you can tolerate the few negatives - it's a very reasonable price and you may like it more than we did",
        "There is one mall 'Bali collection' that is very close by, if you like shopping, but it is quite westernised in terms of the pricing",
        "The hotel manager categorically refused to give us some sort of refund! So we will be leaving the hotel 3 nights before our planned departure and not even one night will be refunded",
        "So I would not advise people to book in advance and pay in full",

        "Spa was the best I have been to and great value for money",
        "Great value for money!",
        "The other problem that stems from this is that while there is a pricey bill at the end, you will also lose money from tipping, which if you feel for the human condition of Balinese people its kind of essential to tip and they deserve it because they work hard",
        "Taxis from the Hotel were good value to anywhere",
        "Price of food at the restaurants is very expensive but so is everything else in Nusa Dua area",

        "Skip it, pay the extra money and stay somewhere else in Nusa or better yet Jinparan or Sanur",
        "If you like to shop, I'd recommend to wait until you go into Kuta as I found the prices more expensive in Nusa Dua",
        "I can't remember the name of the spa we used but shop about as prices vary quite a bit and we didn't go for the cheapest, we picked the one that looked most relaxing while still reasonable prices",
        "Catch the free shuttle bus to the Bali-Connection and stock up in the markets (there are 3 but the prices are the same); only one has wine/spirits",

        "The food was excellent and we felt that we got great value for money",
        "Although the price is abit higher then the city center can offer but it worth it",

        "Apart from the included breaky only had a couple of meals in the hotel (which were very nice) but prices higher than eating out at Tanjung Benoa or Bali Collection",
        "the grounds are beautiful and tended to on a high standard",
        "But the hotel was at a very high standard",
        "we felt that we needed to go out all the time to eat somewhere cheaper",
        "There is a bus that takes you there for free however not that reliable",
        "I would stay here again because the price-value ratio is good",
        "Free Wi-Fi is provided in the lobby area but it is quite slow so i would recommend using the business centre to quickly take care of emails etc and then get on with your day",
        "worth ur time and money",
        "Free wifi is limited to the lobby area, but there are plenty of couches and seating for you to take your time fulfilling your online obligations",
        "Overall still recommended for the value we paid",
        "its a very nice property for the price they offer it in",
        "We got the palace club room which is very recommendable since you get to stay at the palace club, where the breakfast is much better, and you get evening tea and cocktail our included in room price",
        "The level of attention we were given made us feel like royalty",
        "Price is alrite, standard 5-star hotel rates, not as expensive as a few other hotels, but it does the 5-star basic right",
        "Drinks aren't cheap but you are staying at a resort so expect to pay resort prices",
        "Transfer to hotel was smooth as it is around 20 mts drive",
        "We have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the last few years",
        "The prices in the hotel are at least 3-fold compared to prices outside the hotel area so usually we preferred to eat outside the hotel",
        "We wanted to stay in the Nusa Dua area and this one seemed to be one of the better value for money ones",
        "In a 5 star resort I believe that this should be included in the price",
        "By no means a bad hotel and very good value for money - just be aware of its shortfalls",
        "Everyone warns about changing money in Bali, and I was a little disappointed that the bank within the resort did try to short change me! So be mindful of this!! Also the taxi service is a lot more expensive from the resort, just pop outside the gates and grab yourself a bluebird cab!",
        "After a million dollar renovation, I was expecting a swanky modern hotel, it was a let down",
        "They offer free shuttle service to & from, a great place for dining in the evening & paying half the price which is an up",

        "I'm a Bali regular who was dissappointed",
        "IOverall we felt like we treated as just another number",
        "Very good value for money",
        "Heard the odd grumble about prices in the restaurants and bars - frankly, if you want this level of service, surroundings and safety, there is a price to be paid",
        "The facilities were very high class and the prices are not that unreasonably expensive",
        "Free child care for kids 3 and up",
        "Without any hesitation, we made our booking and looking forward our stay at here",

        "I cant even imagine how much money it would cost these days to build such as a hotel as the details in the woodwork, carvings, floors etc",
        "IMO, prices should be at least 25% cheaper",
        "the value i was booking a spa appointment for the early a",
        "Very nice hotel, good prices and infraestructure, good amenities",
        "Upgraded to Palace Club was worth the money",
        "The hotel meets our family priorities are: price, beach, room, pools, room-to-beach distance",

        "Our room was fine although others in our party had rooms that were extremely small and disappointing for the money paid",
        "Although the grounds are nice, I did not feel that we received the value for what we paid",
        "All for a reasonable price considering we were in a 5 star Hotel",
        "Free WI FI Internet, lovely pools and great buffett breakfast",
        "but take one from outside hotel, as hotel adds a large surcharge if booked with them",
        "Many just expect how to make you a paying client and how to serve you at the maximum charge! the hotel was clean, beautiful and memorable but except the excellent breakfast we were not so happy with the other meals",
        "The portion is generous, we shared a portion between 2 of us!",
        "I would say this hotel is worth staying and it will give you absolute value for money",
        "If you want to stay in a quiet place with private beach, pools and cocktails within a reasonable price, this one is perfect",
        "They try to make money wherever they can",

        "AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",
        "This place did well to live up to my expectations, we'll definitely be back",
        "The character comes at a cost, however",
        "Free wifi on the lobby area and lobby bar, though",
        "You will pay well under half the price the hotel would have charged you",
        "This was an outstanding holidays my wife and I really relaxed in a setting surrounded by an extremely friendly, competent and professional staff, the rooms are all excellent size and very clean, actually spotless with all amenities, it is our point of view that the value for money is also excellent",
        "And therefore the prices are higher",
        "Which in case of this resort is worth the money:",
        "Great value for money! The only drawback is the location which is a little bit far from all the sites but at least is in a very quiet and safe area where all the big hotels are",
        "Would come back perhaps if we got same sharp rate next time",
        "I complained about aircon one night and was automatically offered a room change or upgrade",
        "Only gripe is the excessive price of the food for quality that is actually quite average",
        "For me, all these justify the higher rate",
        "but theat hear say, facitilities are clean, nice, price is high too",
        "There are also convenience stores for things like Bintang beer, soft drinks and water that are a fraction of the resort prices (e",

        "Standard 5 star prices",
        "Once you are at Bali Collection, there are plenty of options to eat at a third of the price of the hotel",
        "They did our washing for 2000Rp per piece (about 20 cents) which worked out less than 10% what the hotel charges",
        "As for the Bali, it's disgusting, horrible, boring, very dirty, retailers are begging you for money, harassment buy shop owners, cap drivers, anyone and everyone,",
        "saw all the island and everything was not worth the money or time",
        "So already expensive - but then they add 21% government tax and 10% service charge to the price! I complained several times and they agreed it was expensive and many guests had complained about it, but there was nothing they could do (was advised to have complained earlier on check out - bartering gets you everywhere here!)",
        "This hotel more than met my expectations",
        "if you scratch and 'win' you will be hoaxed to a selling session of timeshare!",
        "However, the prices of these restaurants are expensive comparing local standards",
        "Within the resort there is also a spa and personally had not tried the spa packages here as the prices are more expensive",

        "Expect similar standard but at half the price",
        "Are you planning to eat at the hotel you better bring a lot of money",
        "The food is good but compared to what you can eat just a cab drive away is better and at a fraction of the price",
        "Also why would they charge money for internett usage in the room when its the slowest connection I have ever experianced in a hotel? All in all, i would recommend it",
        "Our boys had a ball Jetskiing and the prices here can vary down the beach",
        "However, even the \"better\" room was not great, and having stayed at about 15 different hotels all over Bali, we know you can get better value at this price point",
        "There are better choices for this price range and this location (in Nusa Dua)",
        "The hotel seemed to have kept the Balinese feel with a modern touch with all the facilities advertised and the price was affordable for a 4 star hotel",
        "If you are looking for a tasteful, upmarket, value for money hotel you cant go wrong with this one! We will definitely be back!",
        "I mean Four Seasons etc would be possibly be even better and the rooms quieter, but the price would be double/triple as well and overall this hotel really keeps at par with the best 5 star hotels while the effort from the hotel team is really worth the stay",
        "I'm not saying it was an awful hotel, it was nice, but the area, meals served, prices and swankyness/removed from Bali was not our cup of tea",
        "Free upgrade to a Palace Club Suite was awesome, but the Palace Club Lounge a tad dissapointing, ordering free cockatils during the 2-hour window is excruciatingly slow, almost as if on purpose, then they \"run out\" of Jack Daniels!? Shelves stocked up again when free time is up though! Breakfast food hygiene, hmmm, some things need to be kept on ice, or not re-used the next day",
        "I've seen many people on Tripadvisor moaning about the prices of the eateries but hey, your staying in a 5 Star complex so it's not that bad",
        "Going on to prices - everything is a tad on the upper side I",
        "Otherwise 5 Star rates",
        "The staff are nice, room was great ( they upgraded me even though i had already paid a great price)",
        "The Palace Club, although a little more expensive, does offer value for money",
        "Premium level rooms were big enough and rooms were clean and tidy",
        "As previously quoted this is a stunning resort with beautifully laid out grounds, semi private beach and a good few restaurants on site all serving very tasty,well presented dishes at a price !The complex has excellent sports facilities if you are feeling energetic complete with a jogging track laid out",
        "There is no set price for these trips and you need to haggle with the vendor before agreeing to anything, further to this, on the trip we had arranged we first had to negotiate the tens of jet skies, powerboats and parascenders that have taken up the bay area north of Nusa Dua then taken to a so called turtle breeding facility that amounted to nothing more than exploitation of the turtle and many other animals for pictures that are kept chained or have their flight feathers clipped to prevent escape, kept in filthy surroundings and prodded for entertaiment of the visitors there",
        "we were then asked for a cash donation before we could leave the island ! So in summary the hotel is beautiful, the food is tasty and well presented if somewhat expensive and you have every facility available to cater for your needs,just be aware of the beach hawkers !",
        "Internet & wi fi not free",
        "The Palace Club is excellent value for money",
        "I have been reading other reviews on Trip Advisor since March of this year and a number of people have complained about the pricing of food and drinks at the hotel and commented that one can eat cheaper outside the hotel",
        "If you are looking for food only, then by all means dine outside, but if you appreciate quality of food and service, then what the hotel is offering is extremely good value for money",
        "not cheap but really value for your money",
        "Dont stay here if you are looking for bargains, or to do lots of shopping/tours- since its far away from most places, taxis/travel can get expensive if you dont know how to bargain well",
        "Our room was lovely and we were given a complimentary upgrade which was a nice touch",
        "We had read a lot of Trip Advisor reviews about the hotel restaurants and bars being too expensive so were ready to go out for most meals, but when we arrived we found that the prices were more than reasonable",
        "I agree that these prices are more expensive than you find outside the hotel, they are very cheap comapred to some other hotels we have stayed at in Nusa Dua",
        "There is a nice restaurant up the beach that offers lovely food at about half the price",
        "Didnt think it was worth the money",
        "Outstanding value, highly recommended",
        "The hotel was far cheaper than the Westin and many of the others, and i think actually presents very good value for money",
        "The staff were exceptional, the room lovely and we felt it was very good value for money",
        "However the price of food and drink is ridiculous",
        "- The price of food and drink in the hotel needs a serious review - it is laughably expensive",
        "EVERY hotel I have stayed at in the last 2 years (including lesser hotels in 'money grabbing' Russia) have offered free Wi-fi",
        "Hotel shop prices were 3 times the price of local shopping area",
        "The price for food and drink was exceptionally expensive",
        "We probably would have spent a lot more there if the prices were not so prohibitive, instead we left the hotel to eat and drink",
        "Free red bus to Mall and local area",
        "Price was standard for any hotel in the area, which is a little less than western pricing but expensive for Bali",
        "If the prices were lower then more quests would enjoy the bar area rather than leaving for the other resorts",
        "At aud$75",
        "Well worth the extra few dollars",
        "So weighing up that cost that is individual choice",
        "There were some equally good places to eat at half the price on the road leading into Nusa Dua - only a short well lit walk away",
        "The hotel in reality has two major swimming pools, both of which are very nice, very clean and very easy to access and were rarely busy during our stay in the first week of Australian school holidays, the Main Pool has a swim-up bar which unfortunately was quite expensive and in some cases prices were higher than Australia after Tax and Service Charge",
        "com), and I suppose as you got the room at a discounted price you are treated accordingly",
        "I suppose this is just a ploy to extract more dollars from unsuspecting guests",
        "I really intend eating outside every night as the thought of spending more money here doesn't sit well with me",
        "This hotel offers value for money compared to equally large hotels in Nusa Dua, at only $190US a night, I felt the price reflects what we got, probably just leaning on the overpriced side",
        "One more thing, the food/drink price is quite expensive for my side, so either you manage to brought it from the outside, or bring extra cash (maybe this is how they maintain the taste afterall)",
        "This was a lastminute booking and we were amazed",
        "The value for money was the best",
        "The cultural shows were a bonus and there is lots to see in BALI",
        "There was an outstanding selection of restaurants for dinner and lunch still the prices were a bit on the high side",
        "But it is very easy to take free shuttle bus to Bali Collection and enjoy excellent food for very affordable prices",
        "86 but their money change desk only gave you",
        "There is an ATM at the hotel with a good exchange rate",
        "000 IDR (ca 1 USD)",
        "Let's talk about a gross margin of 900%! Shame on you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel! I think it's really rood; not even a bottle of water in our hotel in Gothenburg costs so much",
        "If you go with your family and children to Nusa Dua their high prices can ruin you quickly",
        "and what i must say-during our one week holidays i've heard about more then 5 cases of money stealing,and finally we fall victim to this",
        "Prices for ALL activities are negotiable, so don't accept the first price they quote you",
        "Work a deal for yourself",
        "However quite expensive, best deal is to have the half board",
        "This hotel is a great place to stay for luxury and relaxation at a reasonable price",
        "There is a well lit pathway, if you turn left you will come accross a little restuarant and bar called Kendi Kuning, it's about 10 -15 minutes walk, but you can get a cab, the food there is excellent and really good value, the drinks too are much cheaper than the hotel",
        "The hotel prices for food and drink are quite high, but there are other places nearby at Bali Collection ,a shopping mall about 15 -20minutes walk away",
        "they perform it once a week with a price but it well worth it",
        "The Palace Club was certainly excellent value for money, we rarely had to buy a meal whilst we stayed there",
        "the spa facilities were great, lots of options at reasonable prices",
        "All in all a very nice to place to stay and very good value for the money",
        "My advice is to try another and see if you get more for your money there",
        "- an extremely expensive place with low value for money",
        "- transfer should've also been included in a high class hotel",
        "Overwall a decent hotel, but for the price I think I would've liked a bit more perks, like a better beach or free Internet, which I'm sure other hotels could provide",
        "It is just a short ride on the free shutle to shopping and restaurants(who drive you home for free)",
        "Booked hotel through Expedia",
        "We saved quite a bit of money that way",
        "The other not so positive issue was the price of the meals inside the Hotel comparing with the prices outside",
        "They also offer pick up and drop off for no charge although a tip is polite I would suggest",
        "Booked a couple of tours in Nusa Dua which was much less than the advertised price in the brochure and almost certainly far less than what you would pay if booked directly through the hotel",
        "Both very well run and good value for money",
        "We had a free upgrade to a family room so there was lots of extra room for the 4 of us",
        "But being in a resort specific area of Bali the prices of everything were pretty inflated",
        "Awesome if your looking to just relax and don't mind paying a premium",
        "This leads me to one complaint about this hotel",
        "We saved a lot of money by not paying tourist rates",
        "Free Internet access was part of the service and we were offered an upgrade to an ocean view suite",
        "(Not long enough) Booked 2x palace club rooms which where lovely and well worth the extra money",
        "Be careful with your money the lots of zeros gets a bit confusing and make sure you carry small notes with you as most places (in markets, small stores and shopping centres) don't always have the change, especially taxis we were caught out day 1 but now we know what to do",
        "This was absolutely worth every money and luxury",
        "Compared to other hotels in the same price range, it is probably the most beautiful and generous place in Nusa Dua",
        "They also kept my room desposit which was more than the daily rates I paid, for over a week and I had to call up to get it back",
        "We also soon discovered that prices in Nusa Dua, whether it be spa facilities, restaurants or even drinks, were generally higher than elsewhere on the island",
        "the restuaraunts at the hotel are all fantastic and by western standards very good value but once you have been out of the hotels and see waht you pay blimey!!! bali can be very cheep!",
        "The downside",
        "After discussing this with the manager we were upgraded as an apology for free - this was well worth it as we were moved to a better located room and had no compliants",
        "usual cards",
        "This hotel really lived up to our expectations",
        "Its older than some of the other Nusa Dua properties but don't let that put you off",

        "Everything is just of such a high standard!",
        "All our expectations were met and beyond",
        "We fly with Singapore Airlines, they are just simply the best and we do a lot of travelling",
        "We casually \"inspected\" each of the other properties during our stay, in case we found a better one than ours, but ours was by far the overall best, for many reasons",
        "This was our first trip to Indonesia (let alone Bali) and we were traveling with a 2-yr old, so we thought it better to splurge a little and pay for a nicer place where we wouldn't have to worry about anything",
        "Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a romantic exotic getaway and dont mind spend a little extra money for the comfort",
        "We needed to be close to the airport so decided to move from Ubud and have a couple of night in Nusa Dua - whilst there are more modern and flashy properties the service and style of this hotel are a winning combo , couple with good value rates especially for the Palace Club - a worthwhile upgrade for the money I beleive",
        "Great amenities: Free child minding service for our kids below 5), a lounge for resting with shower rooms and television (after you have checked out or checked in) and 2 kids pools + 2 adult pools",
        "instead get a taxi from just outside the hotel and you will get it for a third of the price",
        "I can't remember the price but it was not expensive, the plate was much bigger than we expected and the fruit was delicious",
        "Make sure you don't waste your money on hotel taxi's, just walk out of the gate and you will find taxies for half the price",
        "also change your money any place other than the hotel, the rates are way lower than what you will get out side",
        "If you pay the bill in cash (who does) change currency out side as the US$ published on the hotel site is converted to Rupiah for the bill",
        "You can get a cab out to local restaurants, and as others have mentioned, get the same good food for about half the price! We can recommend Bumbu Bali restaurant, traditional Balinese food, a short cab ride away",
        "Both are a good size",
        "They were both the same price R325K (ex service charge & tax) per adult, half price for children",
        "Everything being sold can be purchased in Kuta or Nusa Dua village for a fraction of the price",
        "(See above for better option)",
        "Matahari department store is very good- clothing, shoes, bags, jewellery, gifts etc with fixed prices",
        "The first price quoted by the seller is usually ridiculously high, you should pay no more than prices quoted above",
        "All in all well worth the money",
        "The drinks and food in the mini bar were expensive as expected, we went to Bali Collection and stocked up on the same things for a quarter of the price",
        "It is absolutely excellent and worth the money",
        "and outside of the hotel, it can be difficult to exchange your money for the best rate if your money is bent, wrinkled or torn a bit (very surprising!!)",
        "We complained and were moved to another room which was an improvement but was not as nice as a 3* place we had just come from in Legian (for half the price)!",
        "If it weren't for the poor service and the rooms which were not up to standard this hotel would have been rated 4 or 5, just expected better for the money we paid out",
        "Our Thomas Cook rep Kasna was very nice and helpful and arranged some very good trips for us at reasonable prices",
        "The palace club is defenitely wortth the money",
        "Try to get a package that includes some of your food, and try to eat out at some of the restuarants just outside the Nusa Dua maingate as they give you much better value for money",
        "You get your breakfast in a separate area in such a a peaceful and beautiful setting and you will also get evening drinks and nibbles included in your price",
        "I agree that the price of the food is high, and indeed you can get cheaper food outside the hotel, which we did do at times",
        "Its not a bad hotel all considered, which is why so many people rate it highly, but in the end the room just got to us especially as the weather wasn't great and we wanted to spend more time in there",
        "There's plenty of places outside to eat for 1/3rd the cost of the hotel, and just as good",
        "There is a feeling of a strong push to consume and there is not much for free",
        "This hotel is a member of Leading Hotel of the World that have a reasonable price",
        "Overall, this hotel was quite pleasant and i think it's the most value hotel in Nusa Dua Area",
        "(We had to pay a day room rate of 50%)",
        "My only reservation would be the price of eating and drinking there all day every day, so I would recommend going out into the town- there are just as many lovely places to go there, and you can save your money for some scuba diving or sightseeing to the volcano, which can all be arranged through the hotel and are definitely worth making the effort to leave the gorgeous hotel surroundings for!",
        "Overall great value",
        "The hotel receives a lot of company workshops",
        "Overall you get a fair value for the price",
        "Don't get me wrong, it is still on a very fair and good level, but when claiming being on of the best, this critic is apropriate",
        "You can get cheaper prices outside the hotel but these often do not include the entrance fees or a guide and the driver will try to take you to places where they get commission",
        "They are quite pushy and take you straight to the money changer to get cash for their tip!",
        "Tropical in particular was excellent value with lovely food",
        "It is a nice hotel (and probably nicer than most in Nusa Dua), but I don't believe very good value",
        "Prices for spa, meals and drinks etc are expensive",
        "There are many places to eat within walking distance for 1/4 price of hotel",
        "Only downside was wetter",
        "We would definitely recommend the upgrade if you can stretch to it",

        "We booked this as part of a package and were very impressed! The lobby is lovely, the beach is clean, the pool is pretty",
        "Considering that both the Hilton and the Mandira were cheaper, we felt really let down, having spent more money on what we thought would be the better hotel for our honeymoon",
        "So many watersport options available at a great price and a breakfast buffet to remember !! The staff were so friendly and genuine",

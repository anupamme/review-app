- room was well maintained and upto standards	[u'overall', u'safety']
We were here for a week - the breakfast is delicious with the best bacon ever! I wouldn't eat lunch or dinner at the resort, same as everywhere in Bali, as the warungs down the street were our preference, but breakfast was perfect	[u'services', u'post-room', u'checkout']

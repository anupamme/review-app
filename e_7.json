Wont be able to comment much on food quality as we were roaming around and hardly had any meals at the hotel (except breakfast - which is decent).\n", "\nI stayed with my husband at this hotel for 7 nights in Feb. During our stay we were able to experience the ups and downs of the hotel. The service was good when it was there, but sadly inconsistent. Breakfast was touch and go with regards the service. We could be wandering in without any acknowledgement and be surrounded by tables needing to be cleared, or the complete opposite. There were not enough staff. The breakfast was average but particularly poor was the appearence of unripe tropical fruit at every serving. Small details but the details do add up! We stayed in a standard room and found especially the bathroom to be very dated with a shower head propped over a bath and a nylon shower curtain. We also found a cockroach in our room and although this was dealt with very promptly, it would have been nice to have an apology or offered a change of room. The communal areas of the hotel and the Spa are well maintained and the gardens are lovely. The overall hotel would benefit from a more attention to detail and using the 'Palace Club' as a 'standard'. If not, this hotel should be classed as a 3 star hotel.\n", "\nDuring check in and check out the experience was bad . Hospitality,courtesy,decency, soberity all missing with Mr. Aminuddin at the front desk .

We spent a 6 day honeymoon there and took trips all over Bali. Nusa Dua is the nicest area, we walked around and we think Nusa Dua Beach is the best, most beautiful and less crowded hotel. The pools are spetacular with a in-the-pool bar, many restaurants for when you cant be bothered to go out, service is great and the beach is pristine. The spa is stunning but a little pricey compared to other places around Nusa Dua. Bali Collection centre is great, not that cheap, but only 15 min walk for food and shopping. Breakfast is just a feast of many flavours, endless, but dangerous, slow down, dont go crazy and overeat, or you will regret... take antiacids! The food and drinks at the resorts are very expensive though. But the Nusa Dua centre is just 15 min walk with lots of great places for \u00b4normal\u00b4prices. Internet at the business centre was very expensive and slow... Close enough to the airport and a short drive to Kuta in case you're interetsted in drunk crowds and hawkers... Verdict: Nusa Dua beach hotel is a winner, best stay in Bali!\n", "\nMy husband and I just returned from our honeymoon and spent 6 nights here. The most outstanding thing about this hotel is the incredible customer service.

It has a number of pools including a kids pool & the main pool with a fabulous swim-up bar. There are a few great bars and restaurants where you can have cocktails, bar snacks or fine dining. The rooms are perhaps a little dated but charming. Cleanliness was good but not spotless - but by Bali standards I think it was very good. Buffet breakfast was good and with many varied options to cater for almost anyone.", "We bought a Wi-Fi card and couldn't access Wi-Fi from our room - had to go to the reception area to log on.", "Overall a great place for couples & families. Has business faciitlies but we didn't use them. Also, avoid hotel spas as they charge much more than the independent ones.

Friendly staff. Good breakfast. Room OK. A bit outdated, but fine. Had 1 Balinese massage which was good. Bar is not lively at all when I was there.

Depends what you are looking for I suppose.Actually my son has just added that he likes the beach at Kuta as he has stayed there with his mates.Didn't catch him complaining about NDBH though!", "Booked a couple of tours in Nusa Dua which was much less than the advertised price in the brochure and almost certainly far less than what you would pay if booked directly through the hotel.", "Did white water rafting [actually not me but husband and kids as I was otherwise occupied at the spa that day,sad I know] and also the cycling tour which i did participate in.Both very well run and good value for money.", "Back to the hotel.

Oh yes,one thing, as we were leaving purchased 3 small bottles of water from the bar area which cost us an absolute arm and a leg especially as up to that point all soft drinks had been complimentary as per Palace Club.", "Fantastic time and will certainly return to this hotel.", "One general point worth mentioning.Haven't quite decided after my second trip to Bali whether the drivers are really skillful or on a suicide mission.Can't quite get my head around all that weaving in and out amongst entire families on small scooters with no crash helmets.", "Forgot to mention a trip to Jimbaren Bay to one of the numerous fish restaurants on the beach.I have seen mixed reviews, but we had a well priced meal and there are not many places were you can pick your own fish and have it served on the beach watching the sunset.it was a very nice last night in Bali.\n", "\nOur honeymoon was amazing and Nusa Dua beach hotel made that happen! We spent the second half of our honeymoon in Bali; we wanted someplace relaxing after spending the first half of the holiday in Malaysia.

", "I do not agree with some of the other comments about the hotel as our experience her was great! This hotel offers culture, which when walking down the beach and seeing the other hotel, they don\u2019t \u2013 all seem to be modern, which is nice, but if your visiting another country its nice to see the culture. The staff at the hotel where great, nothing was ever too much trouble for them and they were always willing to help. Our room was on the ground floor so we had a patio that lead to the near pond, where there was plenty of wild life! ", "I have also read many comments about locals trying to sell either day trips of gifts along the beach, but the are friendly, if you don\u2019t want anything say no and they walk away, there is no need to be rude \u2013 if you are interested in buying you can always bring down the price, which can be cheaper then the local markets. The beach by the hotels is private, therefore there are no locals allowed \u2013 apart for the sellers who all wear a uniform of blue t-shirts anyway. ", "Even though the hotel offers many restaurants we decided to venture out, plus the food was slightly over priced in the hotel area and we wanted to see the local area anyway.", "Some places to visit near by is the Bali Collection \u2013 we only discovered this a few days before we were to leave \u2013 which I was gutted about, but the is a selection of restaurants and shops. This is a nice walk from the hotel along the beach, or there is a free transfer available from most hotels. Also if you do venture out of the hotel to find restaurants, many of the offer transfers to and from your hotel, which is great!\n", "\nStayed there for 3 nights and had a wonderful time. The beach was beautiful, much better than we had expected. Water was crystal clear and if you look closely, there were countless tiny fishes all around. We had been to Bali and stayed at Sanur previously and if you like a nice beach, Nusa Dua is definitely the place. We had a free upgrade to a family room so there was lots of extra room for the 4 of us. Kids had a good time at the pool. Staff was polite, gardens beautiful, grounds quiet and well maintained though a bit old in some areas. But definitely nothing to complain about. It was also very convenient to get out to eat at the Bali Collection if you get tired of the hotel food. Hotel has hourly shuttle to the Bali Collection and the choice of restaurants and shops will keep you busy. If you dive, you can try Atlantis International Dive Centre. They were very pro. Diving is really good in Bali. Comparable to Similian Islands and Maldives.\n", "\nStayed 7 nights in a superior twin bed non smoking room. On arrival we where given a voucher for a mock cocktail which was a nice touch. Our bedroom had seen better days and is in need of a revamp. The beds are bolted to the floor and the mattress is placed on a plank of wood not very comfortable and very noisy. The bathroom sink and bath tub both where chipped and the floor tiles where cracked.The room was a good size and we had a lovely view on to the Duck pond from the balcony which had two chairs and a table. Each room has daily toiletries, safe, water and a turn down service which was around 5.30 pm a little to early for our liking! The lobby and grounds of the hotel are beautiful and the beach is cleaned daily. The hotel has 4 restaurants which we enjoyed other than the pizza one which was not good. We also had room service which was excellent. The spa was a delight and we had facials and massages which I would recommend.\n", "\nWe had been to Bali many times. This time we stayed at the NDBH for the 3rd time. It's great hotel with a friendly staff. ", "What I liked most this time was the jewelry course at the hotel. There were hundreds of gemstones and silver beads to choose from. Our very patient consultant helped to finish everything with joy. The result was outstanding. So I made my very unique balinese jewelry just by myself. It could become an addiction :-)\n", "\nI loved staying in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel; it was absolutely charming- Wonderful views, wonderful location (right by the beach), and amazing facilities for adults as well as for the children. The rooms are lovely designed and generally I would describe it as a very pretty resort, worth every penny! We felt incredibly lucky to book in last minute travel for a very attractive price! We intend to come back!!\n", "\nThis was our first trip to Bali and we stayed here based on a friends recommendation. The service was quite reasonable and the room was fine.But being in a resort specific area of Bali the prices of everything were pretty inflated. Expect to pay about 5 to ten times more for food and beverages than if you were outside of the Nusa Dua resort strip. Other than that the resort offered lots of activities and various shows every night. Awesome if your looking to just relax and don't mind paying a premium\n", "\nThis was the most exotic vacation I ever had and Nusa Dua Beach Hotel just added to the mystic. Let me first say that although I did much research on Bali in October and it's location near the equator, I was not at all prepared for the oppressing heat. This leads me to one complaint about this hotel. The air went out on multiple nights during my seven night stay. I must say the staff made every attempt to get it working, but it never was right, leaving sleeping impossible. ", "If you are looking for excellent service, this is the place. The rooms and grounds are immaculate. There's a path that you can walk along the beach from hotel to hotel which is great. ", "If you are looking for Cancun's white soft sand beach, this is not the place. The sand is very grainy, almost pebbles. Also watch out for the tide. I was not prepared for this and was a little frightened at first due to the tragic tsunami. It is very extreme I was told because of the proximity to the equator. ", "The pool was the best. I have never seen a pool this nice in a long time. Very open, clean, and the perfect temperature. ", "The breakfast was more than I expected. They had just about everything I could imagine. On occasion it was difficult finding seating, but that was not the norm.

I personally chose this hotel for its Balinese design and the beach.

I had a high expectation though regarding the staff and their services, I was looking forward for treats like wine, flowers or something to mark our anniversary (just like in other hotels). But... anyways... They didn't even address us by our names. We also went to avail our free photo at the beach but sad to say we can't find the photographer for 2 days! That would be a great souvenir for our honeymoon. ", "The breakfast is good. Our room is clean. I love the surroundings, very artistic and detailed like the spotlight was hidden inside a toad (stone carved). The hotel in itself is very charming.", "We enjoyed our spa, we wanted the 3-hours spa package though but we have tours during the day. On our first day, we went to Ubud Village Life tour, it is simply amazing! We will definitely do it again.

There is a swim-up bar that you can chat it up with other travelers...we had sooo much fun! There is a pizza restaurant by the pool, Sandro's Pizzeria, that is open during the day. Tthere is a beautiful restaurant, Raja's Balinese Cuisine, that you need to make a reservation, but you are able to eat native cuisine in an intimate setting- try the Nusa Dusa Explosion Drink- yummy! One night we had sushi at Maguro Sushi by the Sea and it was good but expensive. ", "If you'd like to eat off resort let me recommend a restaurant called Tropical. I think our total dinner cost us $13 with one beer and one soda! And it was really great! I think I had shrimp with pasta in a vodka sauce!

In fact we didn't ever need an evening meal as we were always so full. You get soft drinks and tea and coffee 24 hours in the Palace club and free wireless internet.", "The gardens that we looked out on with the Duck pond was fantastic and proper serene.

", "The rooms were clean and comfortable, but on the smaller side compared to the other Bali hotel I stayed at in Ubud, but the room staff was attentive to every detail. However, the Front Desk staff was not less accommodating than I had hoped, having booked a large group stay here. I had requested an upgraded room and was surprised that one of my tour guests in a standard room had a larger, ocean view room - by comparision, mine was small and overlooked the duck pond. Now, I did not mind the duck pond view, but the noise at sun-up was more alarm clock than I wanted. When I asked the front desk about a move because of the noise, and mentioned my \"upgrade' was less than the 'standard' room of my friend, I was disappointed at the attitude of the staff. They told me they would have to let me know later - I never heard from them.", "There is a wonderful selection of food in the breakfast area, the staff here and in the other dining areas were friendly and attentive. The poolside bar has the best lunches and great prices, and you can't beat eating on the beach lawn, overlooking the cool blue waters. However that said, it wasn't any better here than at any hotel along this strip of beach.", "I guess the stay was okay, but just not up to the promises made.

I was on my honeymoon and therefore I informed the hotel to try and make it a little special for me by at least providing me with a room with sea view, now the irony is that only the standard rooms and palace club rooms in this hotel has sea view and Deluxe rooms have only garden view, so I had to downgrade to standard room for better views, which was not pleasant at all (coz I booked a Deluxe room earlier), the room furnishing is good 8-9 years old, also the Tv is not a LCD Tv which is a standard in every 5 Star these days, also they do not have a DVD player and but they can provide you with one for a rental of US $15 per day, which is really not required , there is no free wifi and they charge US $ 100 for one day ( A little less at the lobby area ) which is Insane, the food is overpriced but very decent, the breakfast was average , if you want to have your own liquor by the beach they will charge you additional US $ 30 per person for it as corkage charges ,also I would especially like to mention the photographer here who is stationed near the pool area , who was suppose to click one complimentary picture for every guest, regarding which we were so happy as we really wanted some pictures of us in the hotel as our camera was destroyed due to water a day before only, after clicking few pics we requested him to give us the rest of the pics in a portable drive which I was carrying so that we can take back some more memories with us , to our disbelief he charged us US $100 to transfer those few pictures which he otherwise would have deleted, to which we had to say no eventually as it was too much for a mere transfer of few pics the whole episode was so surprising and sad for us as we already told him our problem of not having a camera any more , I believe they are looking for opportunities to extract money for every service they provide you, which are standard in any 5 Star hotels you go to these days and are more or less complimentary , which means except your breakfast and stay there is a price list available for you for any and every service you ask for in this hotel. Before choosing this hotel I read all the reviews on the various website and decided to stay here which eventually turned out to be a wrong one, although one can stay here if someone is looking for an authentic Balinese style ambiance which I think is only provided by Nusa Dua Beach Resort but the hotel\u2019s services and facilities falls a little short on your expectation when you think of it as a 5 Star Hotel, for a 4 star hotel it is a decent Hotel to stay provided the prices are in your budget (Which is around US $ 130 per day on an average) but also keep the above mentioned things into contingency and perhaps you wont find it as disappointing as I did.\n", "\nSimply Beautiful ,nice service,nice beach and a lot of activities,we will go next time for sure!!!", "Nusa Dua best place in Bali", "Michele From Italy\n", "\nStayed here for 3 nights 7th-10th Dec. (Not long enough) Booked 2x palace club rooms which where lovely and well worth the extra money. The staff in the palace club lounge were all exceptional as was the rest of the staff in the hotel, cleaners, gardeners, security etc. The grounds are beautiful and you can easily walk to local shopping, restaurants etc. The cultural dinner and dance was a great night and a reasonable price for the quality of entertainment and food. It is a good place to stay to be near watersports, jetski, parasailing etc. We travelled with teenagers who loved this place. Unfortunatley time was limited but we did a lot of walking so that we could take in the sights. Would certainly like to go back again but would stay longer to have some days just for staying in the hotel grounds. We also spent 3 nights in Seminyak. Thanks to Gin and all the girls in the palace club lounge the most polite gentle people I have had the pleasure to meet.\n", "\nOn Monday the 7th Dec my parents, sister (18years) and I (21 years) arrived at the airport and was surprised to find that going through customs was quiet quick and easy considering we had to claim items of alcohol because it was more than 1 litre per person. They really didn't mind, didn't check and we were moved on to find our driver who was arranged from the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa to pick us up and take us to the hotel. Driving through the streets of Bali was an incredible experience, seeing the houses, shops and culture of these beautiful people was extrodinary and is important for all traveling to Bali to experience as this is the \"REAL\" Bali. We arrived after a quick drive at the N.D.B.H.S and were welcomed by many very friendly and polite staff. The surroundings of the hotel were beautifully decorated and we couldn't wait to see our rooms. We were offered cocktails on arrival and met our hosts for our holiday, Gin (a wonderful and very helpful host) showed us around to the spa, in the direction of the pools and to our rooms. ", "The rooms well.... they are beautiful, nicely furbished, the bathroom is great nice and big and definately not what you would find in Australia (where we are from) unless you are royalty and can afford the world! The room for myself and my sister had two single beds which is what we had requested - they are very comfortable. The double sliding doors which control the air conditioner look out over the beautifully maintained grounds and into a world of birds, butterflies, tropical plants, frogs, ducks and squirrels. Don't worry they haven't been in our room yet but we keep the door closed as you have a choice between having the glass door open or shut and/or the wooden venitian blind door open/shut. The glass door controls the aircon when opened the aircon turns off and when closed it starts back up again. Although it is also controlled by a switch in the room. ", "The hotel has three pools, a lap pool located near the spa - has its own bar and is pretty quiet this pool stays open until 10:00pm.

The hotel is quite impressive. Its big, well decorated and nice secure location. The grounds were beautifully landscaped and the pools area was huge with plenty beds available. We enjoyed cocktails at the pool bar and walking along the beachfront. You can also stop in for a drink at the other nearby hotels. The little squirrels are also pretty cute. I was a bit disapointed witht the beach as it looked pretty rocky and there were warning signs about sea urchins so I stayed away. The rooms were ok but fairly dated. I cant understand the size of the TVs or lack of DVD player. Buffet breakfast and other meals were pretty good. Overall, I wasnt too bad but fairly expensive for bali. Next time I would like to try laguana and Westin. They looked a bit fresher. They also kept my room desposit which was more than the daily rates I paid, for over a week and I had to call up to get it back.

The grounds were stunning (with small squirrels visiting our balcony every morning), pools were crystal clean and the spa facilities tranquil and not too crowded. The breakfast buffet was also out of this world. For a romantic break, it was the perfect location.", "The downside however, is that Nusa Dua is made first and foremost for tourists. We first noticed in the taxi from the airport, where we had to drive through a security checkpoint at the entrance of the Nusa Dua resort area(a result of the Bali bombings.) The guards were very polite and obviously had our safety in mind, but none the less, one got the feeling that we were being isolated somewhat from the rest of the island.", "We also soon discovered that prices in Nusa Dua, whether it be spa facilities, restaurants or even drinks, were generally higher than elsewhere on the island. Furthermore, we were always encouraged to take taxis everywhere, (spas and restaurants offered free transport there and back), which meant that we didn't really get any clear impressions of what local life was like.", "The epitomy of Nusa Dua as a tourist trap was however the Bali Collection - a walled complex of restaurants and shops, equipped with its own security guards, shuttle transport back and forth from the hotel and information desks. Prices here reflected Nusa Dua in general, although we did discover that we could bargain at restaurants for free salad bars, welcome drinks or desserts. It seemed they were willing to offer a lot of freebees to have us as guests.", "After two days of tourist Bali (we'd also been lured into a very touristy beach restaurant in Jimbaran one evening), we met a taxi driver who seemed eager to give us tips on Bali's more interesting areas during our 10 day stay. For 30 USD a day, we rented him as a guide and driver for 10-12 hrs, and he introduced us to amongst other things, the Bali Caf\u00e9 in Seminyak (a 45 min drive away), scuba diving around a shipwreck at Tulamben on the north of the island, a coffee & tobbacco plantation as well as the very charming Cafe Wayan in Ubud.", "We also climbed Mount Batur, the island's 2nd highest volcano, albeit not at sunrise, as seems to be the norm. This was actually very pleasant, as we were pretty much the only two tourists on the mountain. A tip though - get a guide. (A group of mountain guides have an office at the bottom of the mountain.) Although experienced hikers, we wouldn't have had half the fun without one.", "Based in Nusa Dua, we got the best of two worlds.

In the room there was a large walk in shower, bath and seperate WC and a walk in wardrobe. As it was a 1st floor corner suite the balcony was massive and over looked the well maintained and beautiful gardens.", "There are amany restuarants in the hotel which we used early on in our holiday until we got our bearing and wondered down to the Bali Collection ( aka Bali Centre - 15 minute walk along the beach path) where there are many restuarants about half the price of the hotel; although I didn't think the hotel was that expensive compared top others we have stayed in. If you venture in to the village outside of the gates, it's cheaper again.", "The pool gets busy very early, with loungers that must have been reserved in the middle of the night. We had to depart at 6.30 am for an excursion and many loungers had towells on at this time!! Any way our prefernce is for the beach, where the smiley and attentive staff are happy to bring you drink and food while you have a good chat with the beach sellers. Don't worry about these, they ask each day but a polite \"no\", they smile say good-by and move on. You will notice the difference when you leave the resort.", "This is just our opinion, but compared to other hotels in the Far East and Indian Ocean it compares very favourably with those in the same price bracket.

The food is a good quality with no problems. Do go to the Balinese restaurant by the pool, it was amazing in every way. The lobby bar is what it is but does serve a mean cocktail. The pizza place is also worth a visit. The downside. Both the chess bar and restaurant serve good food and drink but service is slow and not just for us. The chess restaurant is where they serve their buffet dinner option outside and is very nice, included is a bottle of local wine (not bad) and unlimited water if you can get their attention. I ordered a beer which was not included and for some reason this posed a problem even though I knew this was extra and was happy to pay. They were very good at clearing tables and friendly enough but the minute you want something you\u2019ve had it especially the bill or more water. The food was very good though. Don\u2019t let this put you of the hotel though as it does have a lot to offer.", "One of the best bits for us was the spa. As we were on honeymoon they do a romance package with a bottle of bubbly which my wife finally talked me into as I thought it a bit girly, glad she did. There\u2019s private villas for this and you are both together in very fetching paper undies (bottoms only ladies), you can wear your own but they will get covered in all sorts of oils and scrubs. Thankfully it turned out to be a couple of women in the spa as the alternative would make me feel uncomfortable. In short we were massaged, body scrubbed and massaged some more, there\u2019s a Clarins? face treatment too which again sounds girly but they massage this stuff in repeatedly which is pure heaven. Then afterwards it\u2019s back down the stairs of your villa where there\u2019s a huge bath, bubbly and flower petals. Also a steam room, plunge pool, day bed and complete privacy. This is also where the two staff make their exit and say they\u2019ll return in 45 minutes and show you how to lock the one and only door. If that\u2019s not a green light then nothing is. The public spa areas include a very nice lap pool which is quiet and in the separate changing rooms are a plunge pool, Sauna, Steam Room, Jacuzzi and showers along with more towels than a laundry. Really recommend the spa.", "You can also wander along to all the other hotels and we used their bars and restaurants and they are much better for the evening. Also, walk to the beach turn right keep going, go round the security fence onto the beach and rejoin the path, there are local stalls here but not a problem, you\u2019ll see a car park through the trees after a while and this leads to the Bali collection, which is good for eating and has a supermarket for water.\n", "\nHidden gem, best ever hotel with incredeble luxeury\n", "\nI stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel with my Boyfirend whilst holidaying in Bali.

Drawbacks are that all five restaurants of the hotel closed their kitchen around 10.30 pm which was quite early at least for us, that it was expensive for Bali standards and the beach right in front of the hotel was not the best one you could find.

For example when I told them that i needed to leave very early in the morning to head to the airport they were concerned that I would miss my breakfast and insisted on making up a breakfast box for us to take with us.", "A great hotel, offering the ideal combination of location, service and facilities.\n", "\nStayed here with the whole family for a whole week. We booked standard rooms. My review is as follows:", "Rooms: Very large, comfortable and spacious. Wide King Bed, comfortable mattress, great terrace/balcony. ", "Pools: Excellent. Two large pools, plenty of lounge chairs, no issue with towels.", "Service: Truly excellent, friendly, corteous and unobstrusive. A gem.", "Breakfast: Plentiful with a great variety to suit all tastes. Quite multicultural too. Highly recommended.", "Facilities: Outstanding. A fully fledged games area at the Spa which is superb for adults and teenagers. Table tennis by the pool, futsal goals and a a couple of pitches. Great to run around.", "Restaurants: Excellent in general and not overpriced. A whole buffet would cost about $30 which is hardly expensive by international standards. Of course, we can eat outside the Nusa Dua area for less but for an international hotel it is not overpriced.", "Gardens: Immaculate and beautiful to see.", "I highly recommend this property to families and honeymooners alike. Truly good and also very good value for money. We paid around USD$130 per night which is not expensive at all by international standards for a resort of this quality.", "I would counsel potential guests to disregard the snobbery evidenced by other reviewers. This is a great place to stay.\n", "\nWhile this may have been a 4+ star in a former life it is now at best 3. We chose to stay here over many others based on the excellent reviews on this website, unfortunately it seems our expectations are higher than some other reviewers. ", "The resort is over 20 years old & has not been renovated in that time and it shows. If you arrive at night it looks very impressive & it is only by day that you can see just how shabby it is. We stayed in a Palace Club room on the honeymoon in paradise package which included many extras such as dinner in the very below average Raja's restaurant. The room itself is dated with electrical problems ( lights turning themselves on & off at will ) dirty showers ( probably due to the age rather than cleaning staff ) mouldy couch & complimentary bed bugs. After 2 days complaining about waking up each morning covered in bites they did change the mattress & pillows which stopped the problem. Although I did have to show my bites in places mosquitoes couldn't possibly have bitten me in order to have them believe me, 2 weeks later the bites are still all over me.", "The pools look quite nice but you cannot get a lounge after 10am, mostly due to guests putting a towel & newspaper on them in the morning & not returning until the afternoon if at all. Once in the pool, if you manage to dodge the balls being thrown around, you will notice a thick carpet of algae covering both the island & swim up bar walls.", "The restaurants & bars are quite expensive & not very good quality, with the exception of the Japanese restaurant, which served good sushi. After 3 meals in the hotel we started looking elsewhere. The Grand Hyatt has a great Indonesian buffet, the restaurant & bar on the beach at the Westin ( next door ) were much better quality than our hotel & I highly recommend asking the concierge to make you a booking for dinner at Bumbu Bali, a great restaurant in Tanjung Benoa.", "We walked & rode up & down the beach several times & inspected a couple of other resorts along the strip. I would probably consider the Westin or the Laguna if we returned to Nusa Dua.\n", "\nRecently returned from a 10-day stay at this beautiful hotel. We were in a group of 15 (extended family vacation). Overall our experience was very good; however, the management needs to greatly improve their beach safety facilities - there are NONE. Some of our group got caught in a strong current one day while swimming close to shore, within the safety buoys as marked, taking no risks. It was just bad luck and can happen to swimmers anywhere. Hotel staff on shore could not help AT ALL. They could not even attempt to throw us a ring to grab onto, since there were none. There was a lot of yelling from the shore, but no help! We had to allow ourselves to be washed up against the rocky breakwater and then climb out. All of us had injuries and had to be treated by the nurse/doctor on site (for which they charged us). ", "I am amazed that such a big resort has nothing in place for beach rescue. Other travelers who witnessed this horrid incident were astonished as well.", "We filed an \"incident report\" with management and never heard back from anyone. Disappointing!\n", "\nThe Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa was very nice overall, and a very good value compared to some of the wildly expensive (yet not that much nicer) hotels in Nusa Dua / Jimbaran Bay. The grounds of the hotel were beautiful. The room was nice -- nothing special -- but clean and perfectly adequate. Pool was very nice -- two pools, one of them quite big, with a swim-up bar. Food at the hotel was a mixed bag -- breakfasts were large, lots of variety, and quite good overall; the one dinner we ate at the hotel, at the sushi restaurant, was mediocre and expensive -- there are much more interesting (and less pricey) restaurants outside the hotel in any event. The location of the hotel is good -- inside the somewhat sterile, but certainly quite safe compound of Nusa Dua, about a 15 min. walk / 5 min. taxi ride away from a shopping complex with a few additional restaurant options. Finally, the spa at the hotel is excellent -- massages were amazing.", "Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel as a good full-service, resort-style hotel -- not quite as nice as the Grand Hyatts and Oberois of the world, but a reasonable approximation for far less coin. Just make sure that, if you come to Bali, you don't spend all your time just in Nusa Dua -- spend more of your time in Ubud!\n", "\nWe had a very long flight to Bali with 24 hours of travelling but on arrival, the beautiful hotel and resort and the staff soon erased the memory.We stayed in a palace club room which is well worth the extra cost, with a spacious room and excellent service enjoyed at the palace club lounge where the staff could not have been more pleasant or attentive.The hotel and it's grounds are beautiful and maintainence was second to none.A previous reviewer stated that the beach was dirty, but what they didn't say was that the Indian Ocean is quite rough and there is rubbish that is washed up on the coastline in the morning, (like everywhere else) but the hotel have beach cleaners who clear up every last bit of this.The quality of the food is excellent at whichever restaurant you dine at and I would recommend that you try Rajas which specialises in Balinese cuisine.\n", "\nMy family and I ( with 2 kids , aged 11 & 12 ) have just returned from a 6-day stay in early June at this wonderful hotel.

The room was much bigger than our expectations and was clean and well-maintained .The wooden,carved furnishings and decorations exuded a traditional Balinese style .", "The staff were polite and eager to help. We were however , very tickled when we asked the staff who checked us in for an additional set of ' towel' and were promptly given a potted plant with a solitary and brightly -coloured 'flower' instead . I must say the staff really went all way out to satisfy the needs of their guests . It was such an amusing and hilarious incident . ", "I must say that besides , Westin and Laguna, which also occupied the same stretch of beach , NDBH offered the best beachfront with spotless white sand and most importantly ,a large number of clean beach loungers . We spent a lot of time lazing on the loungers and were constantly entertained by the antics of the mischievous squirrels playing in the trees nearby.", "The 2 swimming pools were clean and fabulous. One of the pool even had water deep enough for diving . The lagoon pool offered a good alternative to swimmers who looked for a bit of sea-water feel and also proved to be highly popular with families with very young children as the kids could wade in easily and scooped up the sand with their buckets. ", "The poolside staff also offered very good service They were ever-present and unobtrusive and appeared magically when you need to order drinks or food. We had a few sumptuous lunches at the two restaurants near the pool. Prices were standard , 5 -star hotel rates, however, the food was immensely appetizing", "My family ,especially enjoyed the food at Maguro , the Japanese-Asian Restaurant. We ate there twice and truly savoured the sweet, fresh seafood and tender ,silky and exquisite sashimi . At other times , we also took a shuttle bus to Bali Collection for our shopping needs and dinner as well . Prices of meals there were cheaper and there were also more varieties of food to choose from but we still preferred the quality of food at the hotel restaurants.", "We did not find the beach touts too annoying as they were not very pesky and would disappear quietly once you politely decline to purchase things from them .They were well -trained and could read body languages well.

The other is a \"fake beach\" which must be perfect for people travelling with children. The grounds were beautiful and tidy. Everything is just of such a high standard!", "The hotel is right next to a beautiful beach. The restaurant right next to the beach is really good and a pleasant alternative if u want to stay on the hotel grounds. DONT go for the Balinese dance show and dinner at the hotel, the food was really bad and doesn\u00b4t represent Balinese food in a proper way. When staying at the hotel you should visit the restaurant Bumbu Bali, they pick u up at the hotel, then drive u back. Best dinner experience during our stay at Nusa Dua.", "I would definitely recommend this hotel, since it was our honeymoon it was important that the rooms were of a high standard, which means that the bed has to be comfortable, the room has to be clean, the bathroom should be new and have a tub and shower.

If u want to be guaranteed a luxurious and comfortable stay - book this hotel. We loved it!!!\n", "\nWe stayed at the resort for seven nights in a Palace Club room from 8th to the 15th June. It was well worth the extra money, it included breakfast at the Palace Club lounge, afternoon tea and sandwiches, cake and scones, and then for two hours in the evening cocktails and canapes. The club rooms are are on the ground floor and you have your own patio with proper padded sunloungers. They all overlook the magnificent gardens, which are beautifully manicured and taken care of.", "The beach is really nice although we are not beach people, beware of the beach sellers, they are around all day. We prefer the pool/garden areas. The pools were good, never crowded, the pool with the lagoon style which has a small area which is sanded underneath looks like it is need of some refurbishment, the main pool was lovely.", "The hotel is next to The Westin, The Laguna and The Melia Bali, you can walk, jog or cycle along the path to all these hotels and eat in their restaurants as well as our hotel. There was lots of choice for restaurants and the food was good. We did not eat many meals as we seem to have had enough to eat after the cocktails and canapes. You can also eat at the shopping complex called the Bali Collection. A lot of the restaurants there will arrange a free taxi ride back to the hotel for you, and you can barter with taxi drivers outside the hotel security.", "You can walk along the beach to the Bali Collection during the daytime, its take about 15-20 minutes or you can walk along the main roads, which is quite safe as Nusa Dua is in a sort of gated community with security at the entrance. Just outside the main entrance to the resort there are lots of shops, a lot cheaper than Bali Collection, you can barter there till your hearts content. I had a Balinese massage at one of the parlours there, it was $15 US for one hour, amazing, and a lot cheaper than the hotel.", "The staff at the Palace Club Lounge were really helpful and friendly, especially Gin and Suni, thank you.", "We fly with Singapore Airlines, they are just simply the best and we do a lot of travelling.

Scary faces looking down at you whilst you sleep (artwork - some may like this, our two year old daughter didn't)", "Pools: Again, extremely aged. Main pool and spa pool OK. Baby and children's pools were old and not maintained.", "Beach: Pleasant, slightly dirty - but there were men cleaning the beach frequently. Annoying numbered men and women attempting to sell some junk for exorbitant prices (you have to haggle apparentely, but if you want to go shopping...go to the shops). Old loungers, but enough for guests. Some selfish people tended to leave their towels on loungers in the shade for hours without returning - our advice...just move them.", "Food: Very good quality. All the restaurants served varied food.", "Palace Club: Great perks. Afternoon tea, 24 hour drinks, cocktails and nibbles. Lovely garden with pond, complete with ducks, squirrels and goldfish which our daughter loved immensely. Breakfast is served as you like it, just order whatever you want. (Breakfast is served seperately to the rest of the hotel). Comfortable lounge with books and DVD's that you can borrow.", "Customer Service: Besides the one lady who asked us why we didn't bring our cow along (we needed fresh cartoned milk every night for our daughter), the service was lovely and always with a smile.", "Pest Control: Ask for 'Sony', yes Sony - the man with the can (of bug spray) and you'll need him by the way. He'll pop round with a smile and use his mobile phone light to check in all the nooks and crannies for those little bugs then spray them into oblivion. Thanks Sony, for a few laughs too...", "Spa: Nice pool and games room. Definitely a better part of the resort for those without children.", "Other guests: Mainly couples in their 50's and 60's or families with young children. Not for teenagers or young couples.", "It was nice to be there, we had a good time but won't go back to this resort unless it's given a complete makeover...just too dated.", "PS.

(we had dinner one night in the Laguna Hotel were the prices were sky high! we paid \u00a320 for 2 glasses of jacobs creek wine!) we didnt use the spa as it was expensive but it looked lovely. we did use the lap pool by the spa as it was really quiet there and relaxing. the other pools were great and we made full use of the swin up bar ordered lots of oreo milkshakes! my hubby used the gym and was impressed with the selection of the machines. we took the free shuttle from the hotel to the nearby bali collection mall twice which is nice to have a look around the shops and have dinner - it is a little cheaper than the hotel. however the best and cheapest place for shopping is KUTA. there's more of a selection of souvenirs etc. we also went outside the main gates and dinner there one night but we didnt really enjoy it as the food was a bit crap! we then tended to eat at the hotel as we loved the food and service was impeccible. we booked a taxi from the counter for a day trip and a trip to a temple it was probably more expensive but thought we would rather pay a bit more and go thorugh the hotel. the cars and guides provided were fanastic. it was quiet at night and we tended to sit at the bar enjoying the sea breeze, slipping drinks and listening to live band.", "i could go on and on about this hotel as we had a such a memorable time. if you are looking for something that bit more special then go to this hotel. it is not as modern as the luguna etc but there is something more balinese about this hotel. we would recommend this hotel to everyone and def going back there in the future.\n", "\nNormally I dont do anything like this but on this occasion I believed that I should write something about the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa.", "This property is the best all-round place that I have ever stayed at, and as an ex travel agent, I've stayed in a lot of properties, all over the world.", "Specifically we wanted a tropical beachfront resort to warm our bones in the Aussie winter and we got all of that and a lot more than we really expected.", "The Nusa Dua section of the island of Bali is almost like a \"gated community\" in itself. The roads in and out are controlled by heavy security, as are the individual properties, so you immediately feel very safe and secure.", "The stretch of beach where the resort is located accommodates 5-6 other 4-5 star nice resorts, but they are all south of it, and they dont benefit as much from the sea breeze as it does, which is very important on a hot & humid Bali afternoon with a beer or cocktail in hand. There are the locals on the beach (they are not allowed to enter the resort property) every day, all day, to barter with for imitation Rolex watches and Bolle sunnies, baik linen & clothing and so on, which is a fun experience.", "There are also hawkers on the beach to sell you fishing or snokeling trips on their boats that are moored out front, or to sell you jet-ski rides.", "We casually \"inspected\" each of the other properties during our stay, in case we found a better one than ours, but ours was by far the overall best, for many reasons.", "The pools are fantastic, the variety of restaurants (5) is great, the staff are happy and attentive, the rooms are spotless, the all-inclusive buffet breakfast is superb, and there are no flies, mosquitoes, bugs, ants or other nasties to spoil the days. The other facilities such as the gym, lap pool, kayak & winsurfer hire, internet room, games room, ATM, bank, resort shop, room service, swim-up pool bar, bike hire, taxi counter, consierge, duty managers and so on make the resort a wonderful place to stay, so much so that we will be returning in 2010.", "The cost of everything, except alcohol, is cheap by any standards, and for variety of food you can travel to the nearby \"Bali Collection\" (1.5km away) , a Mall-type design of stores, supermarkets, clothing and merchandise stalls, and many restaurants, all of which will provide you with free taxi transport to and from the resort (provided you eat at their restaurant of course).", "Note that the beach out the front of the resort is not a surfing beach as such, but the water is clear and the sand is yellow and clean. It is naturally tidal and at its best at high tide, but low tide is ok also.", "I suggest that you will benefit from using \"google earth\" to look at the location also.\n", "\nThis was our first trip to Indonesia (let alone Bali) and we were traveling with a 2-yr old, so we thought it better to splurge a little and pay for a nicer place where we wouldn't have to worry about anything. We booked at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel after reading the reviews and were very happy we did. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful. The room was large, tasteful, and generally very clean (the bedsheets did have a very small stain when we first arrived - I am VERY particular about such things - but this was changed after I pointed it out and all our linens after that were clean). The hotel grounds were well-maintained and the staff friendly. The breakfast buffet was nothing wonderful, but it was fine. The food at the Pizzeria, on the other hand, was quite good, and we had an excellent Balinese dinner at Raja's restaurant (both within the hotel). There is no internet in the rooms, but it is available at the business centre for a fee. Walking along the beach in the evening we noticed that some of the neighbouring hotels were livelier in terms of night life, but we actually preferred the Nusa Dua for being quiet. I am also pleased to report that we came away with zero mosquito bites - a small thing, perhaps, but we have stayed at other resorts where we ended up scratching our arms and legs for a week after we got home. We really knew that we had made the right choice, however, after my wife had a bad fall while we were exploring elsewhere on the island. At the time, we were afraid she might have broken her ankle. Upon our return, the hotel nurse saw my wife immediately and then called for a doctor, who arrived within the hour. The hotel provided us with a wheelchair free of charge not only for the immediate crisis but for the rest of our holiday. The beauty of the hotel and this sort of extra assistance really helped us to salvage what might otherwise have been a disaster. Overall, we were very pleased with the Nusa Dua and highly recommend it.\n", "\nAfter going through many different catalogues and destinations we finally chose Bali for our honeymoon getaway and we weren't disappointed. We liked Nusa Dua Beach hotel and Nikko Bali hotel the most out of all the offered hotels in travel agency catalogues.", "We arrived at the hotel at 3am. They gave us a room that was nice and had a good view but was on the farthest side from the beach. In the morning we asked if it would be possible to get one a bit closer to the pool and beach and that evening we were moved to a room that was right at the waterside - the staff was very cooperative and willing. Our room (superior) was decently furnished and equiped - very comfortable. Room service daily. The hotel itself is beautiful - it is authentically decorated in Balinese style and the atmosphere was wonderfuly exotic. The gardens are beautiful and well-kept (you have to see them for yourself to fully appreciate how lush and colorful they are). The staff is very friendly and unobtrusive. The pools were great - warm and well kept. The sandy beach is lovely with a view of one of Bali's volcanoes in the distance on one side and with the beach streching out to the right leading to one of the two peninsulas (a romantic evening walk). The hotel offers beach clean beach towels and sunbeds for free to all hotel guests. The only thing we didnt like about the beach was that during most of the afternoon there was low tide. The hotel has many different restaurants and bars but they are all quite expensive (it is after all a 5 star hotel). We usually left the hotel, stopped a taxi and went out for food (restaurants out of hotels are very cheap and good). Also the spa was very expensive. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a romantic exotic getaway and dont mind spend a little extra money for the comfort.", "Our pictures are on MESIalbum.\n", "\nWhen we first saw the resort, the front lobby was very impressive. We checked in at the Palace Club (same as the Club at the Conrad). ", "The room was not as plush or impressive as the Conrad. Some people have complained that the rooms were old and needed refurbishing. I would agree in one sense, but it depends upon what you are looking for. The rooms are beautifully deck out with extensive wood features. From the beautiful wood doors to a gorgeous wood sliding wooden screen type door in the bathroom, this hotel has warmth and charm. ", " The longer I stayed here the more I loved the d\u00e9cor. The bathroom was smaller than the Conrad with older features, but it was perfect for what we were looking for. The shower was large and the bathtub had both a fixed faucet and the hand held type which became very important in the second half of the trip. ", "Where the Conrad had all sorts of water features, the NDBH has gorgeous grounds with beautiful landscaping and wonderful Bali features. The area where the Palace Club was had a park like setting with a large pond with its own flock of ducks. Breakfast, high tea, and the evening cocktail hours were all held here. ", "The Nusa Dua beach area is the focal point of the resort. It has great landscaping with multiple restaurants, bars, pools, etc. all in this area. Again lots of Bali statues and architecture shows that you are in Bali. An advantage the NDBH has over the Conrad is the lack of noisy water sports off it's beach. ", "Service was outstanding at both the Conrad and the NDBH. I believe the culture in Bali tends to lead to outstanding service at many places in Bali.", "Overall, I would highly recommend the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel. We have stayed at three Hotels in Nusa Dua and I would rate this one the best.\n", "\nWe stayed for three nights with our 12 year old in the last week of May 2009. The moment we entered, the resort made an immediate impression. The landscape- gardens and flora are simply fantastic. The style is trulu Balinese, with sculptures everywhere you go. The resort is large, with great pools. What I liked the most about pools was the depth up to 2.25 meters. Most hotels and resorts restrict the depth to 1.5-1.6 m. The beach was just about OK. The sea has weeds floating at the shore though the hotel staff keep cleaning the beach. The restaurants look beautiful, but we preferred to eat in nearby restaurants. There are a 2-3 restaurants about ten minutes walk away (take a left from the resort and then first right). Even a better alternative to this is to take a free shuttle, leaving the resort every hour, to \"Bali Collections\". This place has a great choice of restaurants, some of them with live music. You can also shop here for souvenirs and also buy drinks etc. from the Supermarket. The restaurants provide free transport back to your hotel, which is very useful if you miss the last shuttle leaving Bali Collections at 10.00 PM.", "The Breakfast is served in perfect settings. The choices are not too great, but it is fairly OK.", "They have free squash and tennis courts, pool table, PS3 etc. Table Tennis near the pools was also interesting and much more used than the table in the sports area.", "Overall, it was a wonderful stay.

The internet ...you have to buy a card from the lobby store to get online first (you cannot log on from your room without it)..Ok, those the less than good things,..the rest? AWESOME! Wonderful cultural vibe on this property. Wonderful ppol and beach orientation - vs. any of the other hotels in Nusa Dua strip where the beach access is cramped and the pool not so expansive. The staff (more senior staff) are wonderful- the lower level staff, a bit difficult to converese with but they exhibit the typical wonderful balinese friendliness.

They rooms are lovely... and they property is just superb!\n", "\nThis was our second stay at NDB for 2 nights in a Palace Suite. We needed to be close to the airport so decided to move from Ubud and have a couple of night in Nusa Dua - whilst there are more modern and flashy properties the service and style of this hotel are a winning combo , couple with good value rates especially for the Palace Club - a worthwhile upgrade for the money I beleive. Next time I would probably try out one of the other hotels along the strip if staying for longer but several years later the service is still very good and me enjoyed our short stay.\n", "\nThis hotel is a beautiful oasis located on the Nusa Dua beachfront. It has what the other nearby hotels don't, a traditional Bali feel, evident through the hotel's lovely stone architecture, beautiful rooms with carved doors and furnishings, fragrant, colourful gardens and very friendly staff.", "I have to add that we found all staff genuinely welcoming, professional, attentive and very helpful. We will definately be going back due mostly to their wonderful treatment of all their guests.", "We stayed in a palace room, which came with extras but as far as the room goes is probably not that much bigger than a deluxe room, so next time will most likely book a deluxe. We were never in it except to sleep and change for dinner etc. We just enjoyed lazing by the pools and the beach then sipping cocktails at the beach bar! We also ventured outside the main gates to eat a few times into Nusa Dua Village. Definately try Tropical, an easy 10 minute stroll, or they will pick you up/drop you off (complimentary).", "The hotel also has an excellent gym (which my partner used before breakfast a few times) and spa centre, with separate mens and ladies saunas and spa pools, as well as a large outdoor lap pool. We were tempted to laze by this pool many times because it is so peaceful, but just never got there.... we couldn't tear ourselves away from the beachfront!", "This hotel is older than some of the nearby ones, but it has the charm the other's don't .", "We stayed a week this year , but next year plan to stay 2-3.", "I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.\n", "\nMy husband and I stayed at this hotel in one of the palace club suites because of a friend's recommendation and we loved it! What an amazing deal because you get a spectacular breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails in the palace club. The setting there is so elegant and refined. The staff remember your name and ask everyday when you come in how your stay is going. At first I was surprised how many questions they asked but then found it is polite in Balinese culture to ask a lot of questions. My husband and I still talk about the breakfasts there, they were sooo delicious and probably the best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel. The spa was beautiful and so the treatments so cheap. I got a couples massage with my husband and then the Luhlur later in the week. The ladies were amazing and so nice! The beach was beautiful and the Nusa Dua complex was also beautifully maintained. We also really enjoyed the traditional Balinese dances in the outdoor theatre. What an amazing culture and what amazing and kind people. The main pool was sometimes loud with children and splashing but the spa pool was always quiet and relaxing for an afternoon read. I would go back in an instant. Loved this hotel especially because of the wonderful staff.\n", "\nWe Like:", "- The hotel Location is wonderful", "- The Hotel architecture is outstanding", "- The satff are very kind and helpful", "- We arrange a one day tour via one of the hotel taxi drivers ( expert driver + brand new car) for about 50$, it was perfect specially ubud and rice fileds.", "- The Nusa Dua area is staylish and safe, Bali collection center and sogo shoping mall are very closed to the hotel with lots of good resturants ( balinees, western, seafood,...) and shops. ", "- Very beautiful cultural event ( dance and dinner) has been arranged in the hotel, a bit expencive ( about 100$ for two adults and one child) but all in all very good, pre-reservation is needed.", " - Visit Jimbaran ( it is close to the hotel) at sunset time for great seafood and wonderful ocean landscape.", "We do not Like:", "- Kuta is a busy place with load of cheap hotels and as I think it is not a completelly safe area, we prefer Nuas Dua area ( but for younger people may be kuta has some attractions like nightclubs, bars,...)", "- We found a lizard in the room, for a troptical area is not strange but the good point is that they immediately changed our room for this reason as we requseted.\n", "\nWe spent 6 days and 5 nights from April 1 to April 6 at this hotel. We came through AsiaLuxe Holidays and had a wonderful time. Our trip included a day long sight seeing tour of Bali including a show, visit to temples and lunch overlooking the volcanoes. Other than that we chose to celebrate my birthday and my husbands retirement right at the hotel and spa. The hotel is built to capture the feeling of Bali and certainly lives up to that. The staff is amazing - friendly, helpful and always very respectful. The grounds are amazing.", "Our room, which was one of the standard ones, was on the third floor (lobby is on the second) and had a balcony with chairs and table overlooking the on-site temple, and a pond with ducks that arrived in a line each morning. It was comfortable although not as large as the one we had the first time and had room to sit and talk as well as a refrigerator. (We'd had an upgrade to a deluxe room the first time.) Breakfast each day was included.", "The food was wonderful, with the breakfast buffet starting each day with so many choices we wanted to eat all day, the Chess bar furnishing drinks and snacks and wonderful service, and the different restaurants giving us a choice of evening dining. We tried almost everything.", "My birthday was wonderful from morning till night and I was honored to receive a beautiful flower arrangement part way through the morning, an afternoon treat of fruit and then after a wonderful Balinese dinner at the Raja Restaurant, I was presented with a beautiful folding fan as a present. I've never been so spoiled!", "The beach is beautiful and so are the swimming pools. You can walk the beach and end up at a local temple overlooking the sea. Local people set up shops along the bay if you walk far enough. It is a wonderful taste of paradise.\n", "\nFrom reviews on TripAdvisor, I was confused about cleanliness in hotels in Bali. I asked a colleague in Jakarta to recommend a hotel and he suggested Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa and we loved the place. We spent 2 days just at the hotel and other days out sightseeing. The staff was friendly and helpful. The entire hotel had lovely wood carvings, even in the room. The breakfast buffet was enormous. They had live Balinese music in the lobby. The beach is awesome - clean and not at all crowded. We were there for 5 days and would have loved to stay a few more days.\n", "\nHaving found this hotel during an online search and going on reviews from this very travel site, I gained a positive impression and went ahead and booked my wedding and stay at this hotel.", "The grounds were beautiful, our room amazing (we were kindly upgraded!!!) and the staff were excellent. In short, we were not disappointed. I'd like to espcially thank and mention my wedding co-ordinator Reni Aviantari for taking such good care of us and making sure our wedding was perfect!", "We not only had our wedding ceremony there but also booked a cocktail hour and reception for our small party.", "The food was absolutely delicious and they coordinated food service with our wedding program perfectly. They also set up some personal wedding props, a speaker system, a mike and a dance stage which allowed for speeches, the waltzes and some booty shaking. Everyone had an amazing time!", "I would highly recommend having your wedding at this hotel...it really made for the perfect wedding :)\n", "\nThis is truly a world class hotel with amazing service. The rooms were beautiful and very tastfully done!! The Service by the staff here is beyond excellent!!! The location and facilities are lovely! The beach front is superb!!! I would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel!!\n", "\nI stayed at the resort with my husband and two young kids (4 and 3 years old) and had a wonderful time at the resort. On arrival at the resort, you would be greeted by the magnificent Bali architecture at the entrance and through out the hotel premise. We were staying at the family room on the 3rd floor at the corner, overlooking the swimming pool. The resort ground is huge and provides ample space for everyone. Great amenities: Free child minding service for our kids below 5), a lounge for resting with shower rooms and television (after you have checked out or checked in) and 2 kids pools + 2 adult pools. We booked a day tour at the hotel taxi counter but we later found out that the guide who spoke to us over the phone was not the guide who was bringing us around but another assigned driver, so it was not worth the higher rate we paid for.\n", "\nI split my stay in bali to 2 hotels; this being the latter, and as it turns out, entirely better in comparison. We had an early scuba trip on the check-in day, and there was no problem dropping our luggage with them as we transited from the first hotel. On arrival you will notice the beautiful landscaping and Balinese architecture, beyond the security checkpoints of Nusa Dua and the hotel.", "The deluxe room is cosy but a tad dated; the shower area is small but you can use the bathtub, bed is comfortable, tv's very small, air conditioning is great (it sinks to low mode whenever you exit the room). Room service is satisfactory, no trolleys but they leave you with the trays. Breakfast is pretty nice, with a wide selection that should go well with most people. While we were there, the hotel had high occupancy and so the breakfast queue was long but still the staff did a commendable job keeping things going and guests happy.", "The gardens, pools and private beach of this hotel are remarkable, with friendly resident squirrels as a nice addition, if you're cool with animals. There's pool side dining, beach side dining but we took a stroll and had a fabulous meal at Westin (and befriended a terrific dude) next door. The lagoon is fine to swim but I doubt snorkeling will be fruitful. Probably because of the large number of guests (families & big groups), we observed a couple of conflicts but nothing major, and the holiday atmosphere remains. The staff are mostly friendly, helpful and efficient, so the service level is great.", "My Bali experience fell short of what I hoped, but I give this resort much credit for its overall positive contribution. In fact, its probably one of the best thing this trip, thus for what is worth, I am glad I stayed in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa.\n", "\nwe stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon. cannot really fault it. 10 minutes to kuta by taxi where all the bars and restaurants are. do not get a taxi from the hotel as you will be charged over the odds. instead get a taxi from just outside the hotel and you will get it for a third of the price. nice food and better poolside bar.\n", "\nMy husband and I stayed here for 9 nights on our honeymoon. It was fantastic. The staff could not have been nicer or more accomodating. We were upgraded for free at check in and it just got better from there. Some comments on how the rooms are old and need updating were unfounded. Granted it is an older hotel, but that is why we loved it. The beautiful Balinese style and tranquility was so relaxing!", "The beach chairs do get claimed early, but we found that the spa pool is open to all guests and was never crowded! It's also shaded and does not allow children.", "The Balinese Restaurant at the hotel was superb. This is definitely the place to stay if you want the true Bali style atmosphere. The breakfast buffett was enormous and we enjoyed trying all the new and different foods each day. I don't think there is anywhere in the world more peaceful, yet energizing that having a cup of Bali coffee in the outdoor breakfast lounge.", "We walked along the beach path and ventured into some of the other hotels. They were nice, but not really \"Bali\".", "I would highly recommend Nusa Dua Beach Hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing, sumptuous stay!\n", "\nWe spent 7 nights at this resort and from the moment of arrival we were in love with the place. We chose it because of the quiet location and the facilties, we were not disappointed. It retains the Bali feel with the architecture and is immaculatively presented. The food offered at the restaurants is varied and great quality. Breakfast is the usual buffet and while it doesn't vary greatly, there are ample choices.", "We stayed in a ground floor superior room looking out towards the pool area. It is very well maintained and quiet. The rooms are very adequate for the price, cleaned daily with a bed turn down and fresh towels and water each evening. There are always friendly and helpful staff nearby. The pools are great, we spent the first 2 days near the larger pool and moved over to the grass area for the remainder as it was very hot early afternoon and on the grass area there is more shade. We ventured into the ocean a couple of times, but the drop away is rapid, so we felt safer and more relaxed in the pools. ", "Nusa Dua beach resort and others within this area are within easy access to Kuta, but if you want relaxation and quiet, we fully recommend. The front security checks are comforting, if you want to bargain without the high pressure, there are market places within 10 minutes walking and the restaurants, much cheaper than the resorts, but great quality also. Bali Collection Shopping Centre is also 10 minutes walk, with department store shopping and market stalls in a mall. Again, the security checks at the entrance are a comfort. We went to Jimbaran Bay for dinner one evening, very pricey for what you get, but very smokey and could not see our food as too dark on the beach tables. We are happy with the outing but won't do it again, there are better places within Nusa Dua and cheaper.", "If you want 5 star accomodation away from it all, with full relaxation stay in Nusa Dua. To stretch the budget, eat at the market or Bali Collection, pick up some drinks and food from either Hardy's Supermarket or at Bali Collection where you can also arrange tours, have massages and do some shopping. If you have kids, it is perfect, they are safe, in clean surrounds and will find things to do. We will be back!\n", "\nOn arrival we were thrilled with our accom selection. Having never stayed in Nusa Dua before we used trip advisor to make our selection; and were speechless (in a good way!) when we arrived. ", "My husband and I were travelling with our 2 young children (1yo and 3yo). We were taken to a 3rd floor family room, which had an incredible view over the pool; and glimpes of the gorgeous beach. With young children we were still using a pram, which was not a problem at all as we had a lift just metres from our door. There's lifts at various locations thru the hotel. ", "Loved: The lagoon pool, incredible breakfasts, impreccable service and the most friendly staff with a 'nothing's a problem' attitude - always! Great food, great room, great location - and gorgeous beach. We really had the most wonderful holiday and this hotel was definitely a contributing factor", "The hotel is located within a 5-10 minute walk to the Nusa Dua markets and Bali Collection Shopping Centre if you want to stretch your legs and do some shopping / eating, etc ", "Thank you again - and we will be back!! It really was perfect for us\n", "\nI was at this hotel in September 2008 for my honeymoon and it was a perfect getaway. I chose this hotel after a lot of research and would say that this was the best hotel one can ever experience. ", "Our room on the ground floor was beautiful,clean and very nicely done. It had a private balcony overlooking a beautiful manicured lawn. Early morning we would have our tea with some other guests like squirrels , sparrows and a few other birds. Ha Ha ..The room had nicely stocked Mini Bar,Electronic safe in working condition, TV, Phone line for International calls(though we had problems calling using our credit card.It doesnt always connect you),very nice balinese style Paintings/carvings in the room.The bathrooms too were clean and dry. The best part is that the room was just perfect for a romantic honeymoon and something me and my wife can never forget all our life. ", "The breakfast is served at Wedang Jahe restaurant which is surrounded by lotus pond. Its a very well maintained pond and restaurant and the breakfast is as usual good and tasty. We also had our dinner one day at Raja's Table restaurant which serves Balinese cuisine. Let me tell you that its the best Balinese restaurant in Bali ..serves very good food,nicely presented and good ambience. Its located just next to the pool and provides very good view of the hotel overall. But the service is little too slow.", "The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and you can just sit and relax near any pond in and around the main hotel building. The Bussiness centre of hotel provides all the facilities. There are many shops inside the hotel where you may buy balinese Souveniers and other useful stuff. The beach front has good arrangement in case you want to just sit and relax. The beach is not clean though and you cant actually go in the sea. ", "Surprisingly, every staff member here has a smile on their face which is very unlikely of the hotels in other parts of the world. ", "The location of the hotel is far off from all the major happenings of Bali. It takes a lot of time to travel from Nusa Dua to any other place in Bali. ", "But is perfect for Honeymooners and those looking to just sit and relax. Perfect for almost everyone. ", "Indulge in true balinese luxury and pure extravagance here. Go for it.\n", "\nMy husband and I stayed here with our two children aged 10 and 13 years for 1 night with a late check out (6pm) so we had one and a half days that we spent mostly at the hotel except to walk outside the Nusa Dua main gate to eat and shop.", "We have been to Bali a lot the over years and had driven down to Nusa Dua a few times but never stayed there as we considered it to far removed from the 'real Bali'. ", "I still think it is removed but not so much as we thought, we loved our short time here and would definitely spend 2 or 3 nights here at the end of a Bali holiday to just relax.", "The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was perfect for us, I had requested a room near the pool with the travel agent and when we checked in I asked if we had been given one. The guy at the desk gave me a thumbs up and told me we had been given the best room, and I agree we could not of had a better room. ", "Room number 3129 is two adjoining rooms on the third floor over looking the pool and the ocean, beautiful view, huge rooms, spotlessly clean, bright and airy, straight down to the pool, and as you are on the corner near the royal residents there is no common wall on that side and the balcony wraps around towards the ocean.", "We usually stay in small boutique hotels so the buffet breakfast was a novelty for us, it was huge and delicious, also the setting for the restaurant is lovely surrounded by a water garden full of fish, the kids fed the fish from our table.", "We ate at the hotel pizza restaurant one night and it was really nice, along the beach front they have a fruit stand set up where you tell the guy what size plate you want and pick out different types of fruit then sit back by the pool and he brings it around to you. I can't remember the price but it was not expensive, the plate was much bigger than we expected and the fruit was delicious.", "The kids loved the lagoon swimming pool with the sand edges , you walk into the pool as you would the beach and the sand goes for about 10 feet then it very gradually gets deeper just like the beach. We walked along the beach path up towards the point and looked at all the other hotel grounds and swimming pools. I had thought from reading previous reviews that some of these hotels had much better pools but we thought the Nusa Dua Beach Hotels swimming pools and grounds were much nicer. Some of the other hotels looked more expensive and perfect but they were also much more crammed together, the grounds of the Nusa Dua Beach are larger with more grass and trees than cement and buildings, also lots of squirrels which the kids loved feeding.", "If you walk around the point there is a lovely beach with no buildings and a bit of surf, we didn't check it out properly but it looked great and hardly anyone there.", "As expected the hotel is expensive to eat at but it's only 10 mins to walk out the Nusa Dua main gate and there are markets that we found as cheap as the rest of Bali (bargain hard) we bought new style tops for rp 30,000/40,000 and sparkly shoes for 25,000.", "We ate here at the Nusa Dua Beach Cafe in the resort nasi goreng was rp 92,000 out side at the cafe it was rp 36,000.", "I would highly recommend this hotel, it's probally not the most perfect hotel in Nusa Dua , I'm sure there are bigger and newer, but I think it would be hard to beat as far as staff friendliness and ambiance go. It is in a great position for walking around and looking out side the complex of hotels, the gardens are lush and although some things are a bit worn everything is spotlessly clean and well maintained.\n", "\nIf you are willing to live a truly Balinese style - do not hesitate going to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa. Of all the hotels that lie on the same laguna strip adjacent to Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, - Westin, Melia Bali, Laguna - this is the one retaining pure traditions of Bali, best beach (the biggest of all the hotels and the only one with most sun, unlike the closest hotels) and huge territory. In 2 weeks we didnt manage to learn all the amenities in this wonderful hotel with exceptionally friendly and helpfull staff, gorgeous green gardens and pools, lots of architecture (unlike most others in Nusa Dua area). Neglect the reviews stating poor conditions of the hotel - like the hotel is outdated, old, etc. - the hotel was really restored over 10 years ago, but there's hardly anything outdated as much as to give it a negative opinion. The staff - from beach cleaners to hotel managers is smiling and welcoming you 24-7, whatever you need or ask for is done for you fast and with most sincere smile (special thanks and hello to manager Madi for prompt help and great attitude). Tips in hotel are not accepted, with very few exceptions. Compared to the hotel website the hotel itself is dozens times more impressive than it looks on pictures and video. Abundance of vegetation, squirrels, water, flowers, places for snacks and meals (though quite expensive compared to other hotels and especially restaurants in Bali Collection center). Good facilities at fitness center, great tennis court for very reasonable money - and the one which is dry even right after the rain. ", "Breakfast: plenty of food, the only disadvantage is the menu which is 90% the same day after day. But this seems to be true with all hotels in Nusa Dua. Also not many vegetables for breakfast. But bakery is fantastic!))) Also would like to mention two more disadvantages - that is the ocean and the Russians. The former - you can feel very well the low and high tides, the low tide means - you can't swim. It is not firbidden, but there's simply no water to swim in. This happens either in the first or the second half of the day. The second minus - this is a hotel, even the resort consisting of 90% of Russians - which sometimes gets very tiring. ", "If you are looking for a hotel with plenty of activities - then you might want to try sth different, since Nusa Dua Beach - like the entire Bali island - is a place to relax, not to make extra movements, not to watch time and to be extremely active - of all the activities on the activity list in the pool area none was taking place. Especially those used to hotels in Turkey and alike will feel the difference in activities. So what we did - was entertain ourselves and also tried to find team to do activities with - thanks to lots of Australians in the hotel it becomes fun, coz mostly people are not bothering themselves with activities other than sunbathing or eating. ", "If you come here on a rainy season (December, January) be ready to experience lots of rain, but it will not bother you - especially in Nusa Dua Beach - since there's too much to admire, you breath is taken away by the beauty of the hotel and the island - and you simply do not notice there's extra water coming from above. ", "Another great thing is the anti-mosquito activity taking place around 5 pm, which leads to having 0 mosquitos throughout your stay in the hotel (heard some of friends' experience in other hotels, where mosquito attacks were a routine). ", "Many thanks to the hotel management and everyone doing his or her best out of the hotel staff to welcome the visitors and make the stay and Nusa Dua Beach a fantastic experience! It is truly worth visiting and staying at if you are not way too picky.\n", "\nI and my husband stayed in the hotel for 5 nights starting Dec 18. The hotel is beautifully located with a lovely beach and nice lawns. We stayed in the Palace Club room on the ground floor . On seeing our room, we first requested a room near the pools but the one available did not have a very great view so we settled for our earlier room and I think that was a good decision. You should try to take a ground floor room as the doors open to the lawns and the duck pond. You can gaze far and have a lot of place to walk around while you sip on ur drinks. The Palce club offers a great breakfast overlooking the ponds and a great variety of drinks and cocktails during the cocktail hours. I believe that its ideal to take the palace club rooms for the privileges they offer. ", "The hotel also has a beautiful spa with Jaccuzzi , Steam Sauna and a spa pool which we really loved... just that u can't have beer there. We loved lounging by the beach and the pools while having loads of drinks. I highly recommend the Hotel for those looking for calm, relaxation and a refreshing holiday. You can take long walks along the beach which extends into neighbouring properties where you can go for dinner too. We quite liked the restauarant on the beach at a neighbouring property, I guess laguna resorts. All in all an awesome holiday. And yes, the best part of the holiday beyond the property is the staff. They are excellent and willing to help and they are a wonderful lot. Kudos to them for a great service and making our stay so memorable\n", "\nAfter a lot of careful research I picked this hotel as the location for our wedding because it was one of the few places I could find where we could get married and see the sea, which was my dream.

I am sure our room was 2133 ( next to the Royal Residence...more of that later) and we had a fantastic view of the sea and the hotel. The other rooms which the rest of our party booked were lovely as well and no one had any complaints.", "We booked the Royal wedding package and all I can say it was amazing in every way from the 3.5 hour spa treatment in our our spa villa, to the night in the Royal Residence ( where we carried on our wedding reception till 3.30am )which really did make us all feel like we were a Royal family. (It had at least 20 rooms and its own private pool.)", "Weddings are meant to be special and the best day of your life but all I can say is that if anyone is thinking of getting married here do not hesitate. The hotel, staff and venue was all 5 star and believe me I have really high standards", "I could not have asked for more and I hope the photos I am including give you a flavor of the wonderful wedding day and honeymoon we enjoyed at this hotel.\n", "\nThe staff was gr8...As we had booked as a honeymoon couple, they made the room so beautifully that it was awesome...

The hotel itself is beautiful and has some facinating features, it appears almost like a sacred ground in places, the ancient stone features are amazing and the hotel has a grand feeling to it. We have travelled alot and I think this has to be one of the best hotels we have and will ever stay in hence me really wanting to review it.", "Our room was very nice and was wooden and marble throughout and we had the most beautiful view of the garden from our room, pink and lilac flowers everywhere, the hotel is very well kept.", "It has some fantastic restaurants on site and during our stay we had a fantastic 7 course meal in the private area at the centre of the pool - I can't remember what it is called in Indonesian now but it was amazing. The setting was gorgeous, candle lit and full silver service with our own waiter etc, they even sent over a trio of musicians which was awesome! I'm pretty sure the gourmet restaurant there is Raja's, superb food and service!", "Only one thing that we found was at the time as Australians the food by the pool is quite expensive, we paid about $55AUD for burgers by the pool one day my husband nearly died!!! : )", "The staff here are so friendly, the Balinese are really beautiful people by nature and this hotel is such a great asset to Nusa Dua, I would love to stay there again some day and hope that we get the opportunity! : )\n", "\nFrom the moment I arrived the staff were some of the friendliest I had ever met.

Thankyou to all the staff who work at Nusa Dua Beach & Spa...you are all wonderful!!!!!!!!!", " ", "Mark & Kerri Matulich Queensland,Australia\n", "\nWe spent a week at this wonderful hotel. From our experience, and from reading other reviews, I think the key is to book a 'Palace Club' room. This gives you an upgraded room, complimentary breakfast in your own private area, afternoon tea is free, as are cocktails between 6.00pm and 8.00pm! The service is second to none, nothing was too much trouble. At breakfast, you have a good choice laid on, then they will cook to order pretty much anything you want! Cocktails includes champagne if you want, it is a terrific bonus if you like a drink, as cocktail prices at the main bars are around \u00a35 - \u00a37 a go. Internet access is available free of charge as well, soft drinks are available free at any time in the Palace Club lounge. Our room was big and bright, looking out to the lovely gardens. It had a seperate shower and a jacuzzi bath, plenty of cupboard space, and an effective (and silent) aircon!", "Eating in the hotel can be pricey. The Chess Bar by the beach has a mixed style of menu, overall pretty good value, we ate there a couple of times. You can get a cab out to local restaurants, and as others have mentioned, get the same good food for about half the price! We can recommend Bumbu Bali restaurant, traditional Balinese food, a short cab ride away. You will need to book - it is worth it! They will drop you back at the hotel for free! Also 'Tropical' on Mengiat Street was nice. ", "We can recommend a trip to Jimbaran, get some seafood while watching the sun go down. Be careful as the taxi driver will drop you at his choice of restaurant. We had to walk out, then get down on the beach and have a walk along before selecting where to eat. ", "A word on the cabs - the hotel will be eager to get you to use their transport. Ask them to call in a 'meter taxi' , which are so much cheaper than the hotel's own. You will meet a bit of resistance, initially, but insist.", "Bali is a wonderful place, Nusa Dua Beach is a great place to stay. We would certainly go back in an instant!\n", "\nOn the whole this is a very nice hotel. We spent 10 nights in a pool view room. Departed on 31.10.08.", " ", "Pools: The hotel has 2 pools- main & lagoon. Both are a good size. The lagoon has built in seating areas which were very welcome.

Water cost around \u00a31.50.", "Restaurants: Guests had the choice of dining inside or out for the buffet breakfast. The choice was average. Some mornings trying to get a cup of coffee/ tea could be difficult. ", "Dinner: We tried Chess Restaurant dinner buffets on two occasions- the satay on the evening we arrived and the seafood BBQ mid stay. They were both the same price R325K (ex service charge & tax) per adult, half price for children. The seafood was much better value- it included lobster and fillet steak, which were excellent. With a few drinks the cost was around \u00a3100 (2 adults and 1 child).

Because of this we had a large balcony which was great to sit on at night and have a few drinks - don't forget spray for mosquitos though! The bathroom was clean, there was a shower over the bath and a toilet in the bathroom, outside the bathroom was the sink. The rooms were cleaned everyday and the service was wonderful, we noticed one time the cleaners had actually picked up our clothes from the floor and folded them for us - something I am not used to! We were in a corner room and were right next to the stair case to go to ground level, we didn't really hear much noise outside, but you could hear the cleaner's cart some days. The rooms come with bathrobes, slippers and umbrellas, there is also an electronic safe which was perfect for us. Room service was open most of the time and the food was quite good, although was the same price as an Australian hotel. The drinks and food in the mini bar were expensive as expected, we went to Bali Collection and stocked up on the same things for a quarter of the price.", "Food: The buffet breakfast was amazing, the best I have ever had. They had two Chefs who would make you an omelette of your choice, they had a huge selection of cereals, breads, Indonesian food (rice, curries, fish, noodles) and a huge range of Western foods (eggs, bacon, sausages, hash browns, tomatoes, mushrooms, pancakes, waffles) etc. Fresh juice, fresh fruit, salads and a wide range of cheeses was also on offer. We never had to eat lunch during our stay. The breakfast is also in a wonderful setting, and I never found it too noisy. We ate at the Japanese and Pizza restaurant at the hotel, the food was OK at both, but prices were no cheaper than Australia \u2013 the pizza was more expensive. We only ate at those places on our first day when we didn\u2019t know where else to eat!", "Hotel: The hotel had wonderful surrounds, the exclusive beach was great, and we were not hassled by anyone wanting to sell us anything. The resort gardens were always tidy. The pool was nice, and was clean. I only used the pool twice (we had a lot of rain on our trip) and experienced no problems. The sun lounges were in a good position and were always available. There was also a pool which was outside the Day Spa and next to the tennis courts which was at the front of the hotel, this pool was right next to our room and was fantastic, it was always very quiet being next to the beauty spa and was very clean.

I used the spa bath and sauna facilities attached to the Spa and these were very relaxing, they were also separate from the men\u2019s spa and sauna.", "Location: Having never been to Bali or any Asian resort area before, Nusa Dua was a great place to start off. There was a Bali Collection Shopping Precinct which was a short stroll up the road (less than 10 minutes). If you walk or catch a Taxi out of the main gates there are lots of wonderful restaurants there which are so much cheaper than in the Nusa Dua area. There is also a market area out the front of the middle gate, which was handy. We rented a scooter and were able to drive ourselves to a lot of the restaurants out of the gates, and had an enjoyable time every night. There are also some restaurants in the Bali Collection with competitive prices and decent food. One tip I do have is when you are leaving the Bali Collection, always walk a little bit up the street and catch a light blue Taxi instead of the Taxis Bali Collection arrange for you. The light blue Taxis are a chain of Taxis and are always clean, safe and reliable. From Bali Collection to the hotel it cost 5,000 Rupiah, whereas the no name taxis from Bali Collection were charging up to 30,000 Rupiah as they weren\u2019t metered. The hotel isn\u2019t too far away from Kuta, and was only a $10 taxi ride away.", "Advice: The only advice I have for this hotel and Nusa Dua area is, make sure you eat at some of the restaurants outside of the gates, they have fantastic food and are so much cheaper than the hotel. Don\u2019t get a taxi from the hotel counter, they charge far too much and are not metered. The best thing to do is walk out of the hotel\u2019s driveway, walk past all of the gentlemen asking you if you would like transport, and you will always see a couple of light blue metered taxis waiting across the road for customers. They were my only choice for transport and were so much cheaper (5,000 compared to 30,000). There is a supermarket in Bali Collection which is where I suggest you stock up on drinks and snacks, and also things to replace items from the mini bar. It is so much cheaper. Also, if you are going into Kuta at all, their supermarkets are significantly cheaper than the one in Nusa Dua, so buy all of your more expensive items whilst you are there.\n", "\nWe recently stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort and had 4 nights there. The staff are so friendly and so helpful. Breakfast had a good choice of so many different selections. The only thing which was a bit inconvenient was the fact other restaurants were a little bit futher from the hotel so if you decide to eat at the hotel it is a bit more expensive(but then this is Nusa Dua-bit more upmarket) It was very quiet compared to Legian/Kuta but then that was the reason we stayed there before going to stay at Legian. Out the main gates to Nusa Dua is a few good restaurants.This is only an 8 min walk which you fell very safe other wise a taxi if people dont want to walk.

It is absolutely excellent and worth the money. There is a private plunge pool, jacuzzi and steam room in the villa for the couple, so enjoy the complete privacy. You can enjoy other spa facilities for the whole day, like the spa lap pool. The staff there said the spa lap pool has underwater music facilities, though i really cannot hear, it is very relaxing and enjoyable. I tried Well Being Spa in Seminyak (a local spa outside) as well at USD64 for 3 hours, it is absolutely not comparable, worth to pay more in the hotel.\n", "\nWriting this review is a hard one for me because Nusa Dua hotel is not normally the kind of hotel that I would enjoy, however this hotel certainley swayed my opinion in their favour.", "The Hotel is very well done the staff are great and friendly and will always smile and say hello while you are walking around the grounds. the gardens are imaculate and very well tended to.", "We stayed in the paradise club which I would recommend if you can, as you get a free brekfast, afternoon tea and cocktails in the evening in a quiet out of the way reeoption room.

If you are looking for a holiday where u can really relax then this is the place for u. There is a certain amount of night life but not the place to go if you are looking for wild nights but Kuta offers quite good entertainment. One small usual problem which i didnt expect was that you have the same old problem of getting sunbeds round the pool, and as there was only about three familys of the usual suspects at this resort, (you know who i mean ) i guess this is now a world wide problem which cant be labelled at one particular nation.

As this was a special occasion we paid to upgrade to a Palace Club Room, the room was lovely, very spacious, imaculately clean & comfortable with a huge bed, and great bathroom area, the furniture in the room (cabinets, chairs, t.v) were a little old & worn however this did not spoil it at all. Benefits of upgrading to the Palace Club were seperate check in at their lounge area (which is exclusively for the use of Palace club guests), breakfast served in the lounge area (with a lovely view overlooking the gardens) also included in the price was afternoon tea & cakes (We did not try these), soft drinks all day and evening cocktails between 6pm - 8pm, if you didnt want cocktails you could have beer / wine etc as an alternative. The pool / beach area of the hotel was great, very spacious & not too crowded when we were there. The pool area could do with a little attention as it is looking a bit worn (a few loose tiles, etc) however there is a lovely lawned sunbathing area just between the beach & pools, so you get the best of both worlds. We didnt eat at the hotel so cant comment on the food (apart from breakfast which was very nice), we went out each evening to the Bali Collection, which is a shopping / restaraunt complex, its about 10 mins walk from the hotel (they run a free shuttle bus if you dont fancy walking in the heat) We tried a few different restraraunts & had plenty of great food at a reasonable price (roughly \u00a315 - \u00a320 for a very good meal for 2 + a bottle of wine, the bill can be much cheaper than that if you drink local beer etc instead of wine) Try & find the Banyan Corner restaraunt tucked away in a little corner of the complex - the food was superb & we received a lovely warm welcome. We loved Bali, though admit we got a very sanitised view of the place as we went to louge around in the sun in a little slice of paradise - which Nusa Dua is. The people were so freindly, all very warm & genuine, we would love to go back someday & would not hesitate to consider this hotel.\n", "\nOK, this is a nice place, it has superb grounds, lovely pools and an impressive lobby. Service is adequate, staff is friendly. I personally found the hotel massive, it is huge and it was quite crowded at the time we were there (first week of May), resulting in a not so intimate atmosphere. If you happen to go a bit late to the pool or beach area, you have the chance of not finding a chair. Maybe we were not so lucky because of holidays in Europe, I don;t know, it could be that in another period of the year it is less crowded.", "The kids had fun, going from beach to pool and back to the beach again the whole day. For young children it is a nice place to stay.", "What disappointed us were the rooms: we booked superior rooms but found them quite cramped, especially the bathroom. Moreover, and I am quite sensible to this, is that the interior had seen better days: too old, paint peeling off the wood.

Pool, Beach front, and the Staff was excellent. The hotel is situated at a convenient location, close to the Airport.\n", "\nWe had just one night at this hotel - and one night was enough! It's not the sort of place we normally stay, as we like a bit of local authenticity. It did the job - it's relatively near the airport, and we could get an early morning transfer. We got a good deal on a room, and the included buffet breakfast was mind-blowingly comprehensive. However, this is a typical international luxury hotel with no soul. Fine if you don't want the real Bali. We really didn't like the gated community of luxury hotels with a security guard to keep out the local people. The water wasted on fountains and golf courses seemed ridiculous. The hotel restaurants served expensive international food. If you want to travel all the way to Bali to stay in a bubble, this would be OK, but if you want a real travel experience, find somewhere more interesting.\n", "\nI stayed 5 days in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa last summer during my honeymoon in Bali.

The overall experience is rather average, the receptionist was not friendly till we were told that we got the Palace Club rooms, which had its own reception area; most of the staff there are friendly and helpful, but a bit too slow sometimes. The building is a bit too old and defiintely needs renovation, and the rooms are okay, but the TV is from 80s and showing black and white while playing DVD for some reasons. The pools are good and the food is also okay. Staff serving breakfast are friendly, but not attentive -- they should have cleaned the table and change the tableware and tablecloth before next batch of customers are served proactively. We like the tress there, lots of trees, very natural and stress free. We went out to Kuta and zoo and monkey mountain which was quite fun.

This room was awesome. Again, it had a beautiful view, of the Temple Gardens this time, and the room was incredibly spacious and well maintained. I would definately recommend upgrading to a Palace Club room because as a member of the Palace Club you get extra benefits like afternoon tea, soft drinks at any time, and evening cocktails. The staff all through the hotel are incredibly friendly and always happy to help with any request.", "Our son made use of the Gecko Kids club a couple of times through our stay, and he usually didn't like to be dragged away as he was having so much fun. The staff in the Kids Club are really friendly and make such an effort with all of the children.", "The pool is beautiful and we all had a brilliant time in the all the pools. The sea is just 30 seconds walk away from the pool, and it is lovely and warm.", "There are men on the beach offering boat trips forsnorkelling etc, and if you ask them, they can organise just about any water sport you can think of.

We were in a party of 7, and none of us had any concerns in respect of our hotel. I agree that the price of the food is high, and indeed you can get cheaper food outside the hotel, which we did do at times.

The lobby is clean, staff are friendly, hotel looked nice, pool is awesome etc. We even got upgraded from a Deluxe Room to a Palace Club Room. Great!", "However, it was short lived. The Palace Club rooms are on the ground floor, and the first impression you get walking in was the smell of dampness. The covers on the bed felt damp, and the air smelt musty. ", "The other impression is of claustrophobia. The rooms haven't been renovated for some time and are quite old with lots of dark wood, making them dark and dreary. The beds are also pretty average and the air conditioning blows directly onto one side of the bed. The TV reminded me of one I had as a kid.", "We asked to see other rooms and the helpful and patient duty manager showed us every other room available (about 5 in all), but they all had the same problem - dark, musty, damp, old.", "We stayed for two days. Its not a bad hotel all considered, which is why so many people rate it highly, but in the end the room just got to us especially as the weather wasn't great and we wanted to spend more time in there. You get used to it, but you don't enjoy it so much.", "In the end we changed to the Laguna (100m away, Westin between). Whereas the Nusa Dua was ok, the Laguna was awesome. The Laguna is just that bit better in every way - breakfast, TV, guest services (ask the butler for anything, he'll get it!), but most importantly benefitted from newly renovated rooms. ", "It the room is important to you, we recommend going for the Laguna as a preference, failing that the Westin. They really are both a lot better in comparision. Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa only really stands out if you don't compare it with these two neighbours.", "(We even enjoyed the Discovery Partika in Kuta more than the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel)", "My last comment is about the location. Nusa Dua is nice, but if you're expecting to do watersports, most the interesting stuff is 4km down the road from these hotels. Don't expect to just walk to the beach and rent a jet ski or anything. ", "Also, Bali is cheap to eat except for the Nusa Dua hotels. There's plenty of places outside to eat for 1/3rd the cost of the hotel, and just as good.\n", "\nWe were introduced to this hotel by a travel agent who gave rave reviews. A quick check with Tripadvisor confirmed his opinions of the place. The hotel's rates is very affordable for its standards, and offers decent amenities comparable to the best hotels which Bali has to offer.", "The hotel is situated in a convenient location, near the airport and within 30 minutes of Kuta. Most of the local drivers are familiar with the hotel which is a bonus especially when arranging transport to and from spas, restaurants and other destinations.", "However, if you're looking to travel to the Kuta and Ubud area often, note that the daily taxi rides will probably burn a substantial hole in your pocket after a while. But if you're looking for a quiet holiday away from the crowds, then this hotel is great with its private beach facility.", "The hotel staff, like most Balinese people, were very polite and generous with their smiles. Most requests were swiftly attended to, even at late hours. Check-out timing is pretty flexible even if you arrange for it last-minute, as in our case.", "On the negative side, some of the hotel's facilities are rather old. The safe deposit box in our room could not be used and the wiring of the lights was faulty, flickering once in a while. Also, be prepared to have to travel a fair bit for meals if you're not very keen on consuming the hotel's food. ", "Overall, it was nevertheless an enjoyable experience.\n", "\nToo big and crowded for our taste but it was our mistake. If you like a big beach hotel, it is probably very good. Bedrooms are small though (we were 3) and the layout of the bathroom makes it hard for two people to be in it at the same time. Breakfast was fine but it was difficult to find ripe fruits. There is a feeling of a strong push to consume and there is not much for free. No complimentary afternoon tea which is quite common elsewhere. We found the Balinese restaurant expensive and quite bland. The pizza place was bad, we had to eat there one night because Chess restaurant was closed due to a beach party barbecue. Pizzas covered in raw garlic (which we could not see because one has to eat in darkness). Lap pool is good though, quiet and possible to swim a km without trouble, nice to have sauna and steambath as well.\n", "\nBefore I booked my stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa I checked out every review for hotels in the area on this exact website. And this hotel had the best and most consistent reviews for a good reason - it really is that good. We had a wander into and around many of the hotels during our stay and this one is the best by far. If you like majestic balinese sculptures, waterfalls, marble floors, silk cushions, the best breakfast you've ever had, big amazing pools, frangipani oils, spas and great coffee then stay here. Many of the other hotels we had a sticky beak at seemed to miss the point that you were in Bali - some were very bland and westernised. The mini bar is outrageous but you can catch a cab to Bali Collection shopping centre (5 mins) where you can buy cheap drinks at the supermarket, there's also a lady on the beach that sells from a modest stall (turn left on the beach) Food in Nusa Dua is expensive but you can always find cheaper fare at Bali Collection Shopping Centre but it's a bit like dining in Surfers Paradise so it's worth paying extra to eat along the beach. I'll be back to this hotel.\n", "\nMy family stayed at Nusa Dua Beach hotel on 31 January 2008 for a short vacation trips. This is our first time visit to the hotel. We choose this hotel because we are curious. This hotel is a member of Leading Hotel of the World that have a reasonable price.

Although the hotel was member of LHW, the staff didn't know about the leaders club that I have joined. So we cannot get any advantages of the Leaders Club. ", "We stayed in the three bed superior room. The room was huge. We're glad because we need lots of space for our belongings and doing our praying activities. Almost everything in the room was old fashioned, but it well maintained. The bathroom was small (for 3 adult) but it runs well. We just have one little problem. The balcony was quite dirty when we first arrived. But the problem was solved, after i talked to the housekeeper.", "The hotel facilities were quite comprehensive as a 5 stars hotel. The staff was overall friendly and the service was indulging. There no need to worry if you wanted to shop. There also a free hourly shuttle to Bali Collections. But, the strongest point of this hotel is on the hotel grounds. It has a beautiful landscape, compared with other hotels in Bali that i've stayed. The arrangement and the diversity of the landscape make the hotel enjoyable for jogging.", "Overall, this hotel was quite pleasant and i think it's the most value hotel in Nusa Dua Area. But, if i may give suggestion to the hotel i would suggest the hotel to do some renovations. It\u2019s \u201cmust to do\u201d because the other hotels in Nusa Dua areas, such as Westin, Melia, Laguna Resort, have recently doing it. I\u2019m afraid it will lose the competition again those hotels in term of modernity.\n", "\nWe stayed at this hotel on 12 January 2008.

The staff could not do enough for us and made our stay really special. For breakfast we could have anything we wanted - freshly made smoothies, boiled eggs, pancakes.", "The hotel is right on the beach which is beautiful and I particularly enjoyed our first night's dinner at the Chess restaurant by the sea. The food itself was good quality and not overly expensive considering the hotel is 5 stars.", "I would definitely go back again.\n", "\nMy husband and I stayed here for 10 nights for our honeymoon, and I can honestly say it was one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen! It is surrounded by fountains and large ponds full of fish and lilies, with temple-like parts to all the buildings making it feel very special. ", "There are lots of restaurants and bars at the hotel, and all the staff everywhere are lovely, friendly and polite. One of the best bits is the bar in the middle of the pool, you can swim up to it anytime of the day or evening and have a cold relaxing Bintang! We ate at the hotel half the time, and the food was very good although quite expensive. For the rest of the time we ate in Nusa Dua itself, which was only a 10 minute walk from the hotel, and you\u2019re perfectly safe walking to and from there at night together. There are lots of great little restaurants where you can eat food that\u2019s just as good for a fraction of the hotel price so definitely recommended. If you want to go a bit further out you can get a cab from the hotel but don\u2019t use the hotel cars, ask them to book you a Bluebird cab and you\u2019ll save \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u2019s!", "The rooms were really lovely, clean and very large with great bathrooms, we had a Jacuzzi bath and a double shower in ours, and the whole room had everything you could need, the laundry service was fine (nothing shrunk or lost!) and there was a huge TV/stereo/DVD player if you just felt like staying out of the sun for a lie-in.", "The spa at the hotel is wonderful, with large hot tubs and cold plunge pools, they are separate for men and women but you can pay a little extra and go in a joint one, or have massages and treatments together either in the spa huts or by the beach- this was really lovely and romantic although probably a bit expensive unless you\u2019re on your honeymoon and happy to spend the money! Nice tennis courts, where you can play for an hour and hire all the gear for only a few quid.", "There are three pools at the hotel, one in the spa and then two by the main area of the hotel, both are gorgeous and very clean. Service around the pools is excellent, I would strongly recommend the homemade lemonade! We didn\u2019t really swim in the sea very much as the pools were so nice, and also there was a warning about spiky sea urchins (and we saw loads!) so take extra flip flops to wear in the sea if you\u2019re going to brave it. You can borrow snorkels etc from the pool bar and there\u2019s loads of stuff to see in the sea so worth a go.", "There are lots of different events going on at the hotel, the traditional Balinese meal and dancing is really good although again, a bit pricey. Afterwards you can take a great romantic walk along the beach path too to wear it off!", "Overall I would absolutely recommend this hotel and resort, hardly any children there which was really nice, although it did have a good family friendly feel too. My only reservation would be the price of eating and drinking there all day every day, so I would recommend going out into the town- there are just as many lovely places to go there, and you can save your money for some scuba diving or sightseeing to the volcano, which can all be arranged through the hotel and are definitely worth making the effort to leave the gorgeous hotel surroundings for!\n", "\nThis hotel is absolutely lovely and lived up to every expectation and more.

I found this site after we booked and was a little concerned about the reviews I was reading. What a nice surprise to find that the pictures don't do this place justice and the staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE going on a honeymoon to Bali. We especially loved the couples spa package. It is heaven lying in the private fragipani flower bath sipping coconut milk and listening to the birds, feeling the ocean breeze and then slipping on a soft cotton robe and lounging on a private bale... A bit of advice about the pool loungers being scarce...go to the spa pool. It is next to the spa and open to all guests. There were only a few people there and it is so quiet and peaceful. The food here was delicious and the prices were what we expected for an upscale, luxury beach resort. Breakfast buffett was very expansive and had lots of different choices each day. We had booked a deluxe room and were very happy with it! We loved this place and can't wait to go back (one day..)

Great reception, rose petals in the tub, a heart made of orchids at the bed. My wife spent the whole week taking care about the orchids.", "The staff was really friendly and helpful, but the again, I think this is a Balinese treat, so I guess any good hotel will serve you that. The hotel room and facilities are well kept, everything looking new, great toiletry, changed everyday (even a good quality wooden hairbrush, that my wife took to the beach was replaced). In general, good attention to detail. The social area is very pleasant, and the Balinese style entrance garden is certainly a plus. The breakfast is vast, ranging from a complete warm Japanese meal and European cheese, to beef sausages, for the Islamic guests. Overall good food, although the fruits seemed to us a little flavorless (but then again, we\u2019re from Brazil, and we do have very good fruits).", "The beach itself is not great, the sand stripe is quite narrow, and the seabed full of rocks and seaweed. Anyway, for us, it was great, quiet and peaceful enough. The swimming pools are great, large, and the artificial beach is very pleasant.", "The hotel restaurants serve good food at prices comparable to what we\u2019d find in Brazil (which by the way is not cheap, as some may think), but we found that the restaurants around the Nusa Dua gate justifies Bali\u2019s fame of inexpensive food. A complete seafood meal for two, including lobsters, big shrimps, crab, fish, etc. and beverage cost us an average of $30~40. I mean the kind of meal that occupies the whole table\u2026 Our tactics were lunching light meals at the hotel, and walking down the road for dinner.", "Ok\u2026 That said, some pros and cons:", "PROS:", "Great hotel, service, attentiveness from the staff, cleanliness, good variety of activities.

Afternoon tea consists of sandwiches, cream scones,cakes and pastries. Evening cocktails are also included along with a selection of nibbles. Free internet access plus non alcoholic drinks anytime. The staff in the Palace Club lounge are wonderful - very friendly and helpful. They were able to advise on local restaurants, outside the hotel and made reservations for us.", "The Spa is lovely, treatments very relaxing. We found the pool area here much quieter than the main pool and sunbeds were always available. Glass bottom boats and snorkelling are available from the beach, which was white sand and very clean.", "The food in the hotel is good, and not unreasonably priced compared to Uk. The Ramayana dance and buffet evening is good value and in a spectacular setting. Certainly better than the Barong show included in some excursions. Themed buffet dinners are available most nights or the pizza restaurant is good for a cheaper, more casual dinner. There are other restaurants in the nearby village and also in Jimbaran which provide transport to and from the hotel. The Pavillion is fairly new and food and service were excellent and cheap, especially local dishes. The Bali Collection is also within walking distance of the hotel ,although free transport is provided there too. There is a supermarket, local craft market and a variety of restaurants as well as the usual designer type outlets.", "We booked an island tour with the hotel Tours desk which was in a private car just for the two of us with a driver and guide. It was an excellent tour, very informative and good value. You can get cheaper prices outside the hotel but these often do not include the entrance fees or a guide and the driver will try to take you to places where they get commission. We did find that some tourist attractions had lots of traders and some were quite persistent. ", "Watch out for the porters at the airport.

On the whole, it was an excellent hotel with plenty to do from tennis to squash to volleyball etc. One point of warning, the rooms in the hotel are quite dated and in need of renovation. They aren't really 4.5 star standard. The staff however are world class and are so welcoming and friendly. The Chess bar is a lovely place to sit and watch the world go by. The beach sports facilities were not free, which was disappointing. The breakfasts were excellent with hug choice. The first room we were given was extremely noisy (interconnecting doors) as we could hear clearly the room next door. Upon complaining, however we were moved to a much quieter and bigger room. Food and drink is quite pricey in the hotel. If you do stay here, make sure to go to Tropical and Bumbu Bali restaurants, which are located outside of the hotel complexes. These restaurants collect you and drop you home. Tropical in particular was excellent value with lovely food. Bumbu Bali is amazing. In summary, the hotel is very large with great staff and a nice beach. The sports facilities were always available and not busy, which was great. The spa is also fantastic although expensive. some great views but way over priced.\n", "\nThe hotel was quite big with traditional architecture and ornaments which are cool. The room is nice and clean but nuthing so stunning. The crew were ok but perhaps cos its a big hotel then they were too busy to get along with guest.

We would definitely recommend the upgrade if you can stretch to it.", "The staff all over the hotel were unfailingly polite, and all spoke good English, so we had aboslutely no problems on that front. In terms of facilities, there are 5 restaurants in which you can eat lunch or dinner, and although more they are pricier than restaurants outside the hotel complex, we didn't find the prices particularly expensive - perhaps that's because we're used to London prices - but we never paid more than \u00a330-40 for a 2 course dinner for two with wine/beer. If you do decide to venture out of the hotel for dinner, head to the Tropical in Nusa Dua, at which the food was tasty and very reasonable. ", "The two pools on the complex are not huge considering the number of rooms, but as the hotel seemed to be no more than 2/3 full whilst we were there we never found this a problem. Having said that, a top tip is to go and find the Lap Pool over next to the Spa, which was almost empty compared to the main pool. It's not big but is perfect for a cooling dip after sunning yourself. The beach was fine but narrow (and literally 10 seconds from the pools), contrary to some other reviews I've read, although we stayed on the loungers near the pool most of the time as there was more shade. ", "There are various cultural performances put on at the open air theatre in the middle of the grounds, and I would recommend that you see at least one as they are a great way to take in some traditional Balinese culture.", "In terms of the location of the hotel, yes it is situated in a very sanitised complex which is very secure - you go through one checkpoint just to get into the Nusa Dua area and then another one to get into the hotel - but there is plenty of opportunity to book day trips out to other parts of the island if you want to experience the 'real' Bali.

The bathroom of the deluxeroom is so much better - both shower and tub and open shutters so You get a view of bedroom and even a bit beyond. Beach is very nice but again seaweed in water makes swimming a bit difficult. The 2 pools are very nice. The table tennis and snooker table was much appreciated by everyone in our company.

To be frank, this does not seem worthy of it's Leading Hotel status; it's some boast to be voted Best Hotel in Asia in 1997 and I think the reputation has diminished somewhat. The property is shabby and does not have the \"wow\" factor present in other hotels. Language is the major problem here because although the staff speak English, general communication including trying to resolve difficulties or ask for anything out of the ordinary is terribly frustrating. At Palace Club level the general choice of food was fine but somewhat disappointing at cocktail hour. Our suite was good though and the senior staff did listen to our qualms and must be credited highly on acting upon them and providing us with a series of \"treats\" which were delightfully unexpected.

To address some other reviewers comments, yes, Nusa Dua is a purpose built resort enclave that doesn't really give you a taste of the real Bali (although a walk through Tanjung Benoa or Bualu village will help in this respect). If you are not aware of this fact before you visit Bali, I would be criticising your travel agent, not the hotel. The thing that I like about Nusa Dua is it allows you stay in a location away from the hustle, bustle and touting that is Kuta and (to an extent) Sanur. Yet, being such a small island, nowhere is far from Nusa Dua, so day tours to pretty much anywhere on the island are possible (although a week in Nusa Dua and a week in Ubud would allow you to see and experience more). As for the hotel, there is not much else to say other than perfect. Sure, food is expensive, but you expect that at such a hotel. Most restaurants in Tanjung Benoa and Bualu offer free transport to hotels, so there is a pretty good range of places to eat away from the hotel (recommend Bumbu Bali, Jalan Pratama, Tanjung Benoa). Room was nicely furnished and cleaned well, recreational facilities and activitiies were great and the Kecak dance and buffet dinner on the beach (Sunday evenings) is highly recommended.", "\n", "\nDuring my stay in Bali, I spent 5 nights at Nusa Dua and several nights at other hotels in Bali. The Nusa Dua was a nice hotel...both the room and the beach. However, the hotel did not even compare to the more traditional hotels where I stayed, including Tandjung Sari in Sanur. One could spend a week at Nusa Dua and have no idea what Bali is really like. In fact, this hotel could be in Mexico or anywhere else there is a beach. ", "The hotel is located on a peninsula with several other major resorts (many of which appeared to be nicer). This area seems to have been created solely for tourists.

The service was frequently bad. Other services such as internet and laundry were fine, but again, overpriced. I made a couple of short local calls that ended up being very expensive.", "Overall, the room and hotel grounds are nice, but I did not go to Bali to stay at a hotel that could have been anywhere.

The staff and management are clearly sincere and friendly in their individual and collective desire to serve the guests. The food was fabulous for this nine day visit. The chefs and the kitchen are skilled in the cuisines of Asia and Europe and each day provided exceptional dishes. The desserts were outstanding. For those travelers concerned with digestive problems, the offerings including the salads were all safe! The property is a welcomed departure from the usual five star resort, reflecting the indigenous culture of the Balinese people. My room was decorated in fine carved wood, and while it had all of the modern conveniences, was well grounded in the local culture. The property is beautifully situated on the beach.

Staff at the Palace Club were all brilliant, couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. The Hotel in general was beautiful, well maintained and laid out, but the service was not as impressive as in the Club. Our room was clean, traditionally furnished (incorporating Balinese wood carvings) and offered all the facilities you would expect in a 4.5 star Hotel.

I can\u2019t wait to get back here!", "\n", "\nFor Chinese New Year we decided to go to Bali and celebrate my husband's birthday. We were a family of 4 with 2 teenagers 14 & 17. The hotel is beautiful. Our rooms were on the Palace Club side but we did not opt for the palace club upgrade. I recommend the lower level with your own stone patio walking right out to the gardens of the hotel. The pools were so nice and never felt noisy or crowded. Like I said, we were there for CNY, but never had a problem with resturants, spa or beach loungers. The staff is wonderful and food quite tasty. I booked the pool bale for just the 2 of us for a birthday celebration. It was so romantic and fantastic, including champagne! They closed the pool for our meal and we were surrounded by candles and flowers. It was definitely a highlight of our trip. The beach is not so great, we are beach lovers, with sea grasses you have to walk through to get to clearer waters. But in them we found sea urchins, star fish and all sorts of critters. We did the Uluwatu temple, but i would not go at sunset. We went around 5ish and noticed great crowds coming around 6. It would have been impossible to take the pictures we did with a crowd. We did a local dinner one night at Sharkeys that was very fun and great food you pick out of the aquarium and is cooked for you. You are sitting in plastic chairs on the sand so no heels, but like I said, very local with vendors coming around selling wares to all the tourists eating. I would absolutely go back and stay at this hotel.", "\n", "\nWe have just returned from a 16 day stay in this resort. We were greated with the flare of a 5 star hotel. We booked the Palace suite with the Club advantages which are a blast and well worth it. The services is without compare. The staff is friendly, courteous, generous and humble. The food offered in the Club was excellent. The happy hour (6-8) is best described as a social adjustment hour; excellent in every way. This place is not dated as some reviews indicated, it is always being updated. The Spa would best be described as Balinese and is worthy of the treatments. The lap pool, spa facilities are very nice. The room is very clean, fresh sheets every day, towels twice a day if you want, free water, ice if needed and supper delivered to the room if so desired. The beach, lounges, lagoon pool and grassed lounging areas are all excellent. It is evident that the administration is working very hard to make each and everyone comfortable and contented.

You may not even notice them.", "Generally, the hotel is well maintained and indeed work to balconies and the Reception flooring was being undertaken whilst we were there.", "ALL the staff are helpful and exceptionally friendly..... you find yourself trying to learn some basic balinese greetings just to say thank you etc., although it's not necessary as most speak English.", "From the time you get out of your transport bringing you from the airport to the time you leave, you will receive a first class service from this hotel. We certainly can give our recommendation to anyone considering the Nusa Dua Beach ...... choose the Palace Club room .... you won't be dissappointed!", "\n", "\nWe stayed in Bali as the second leg of our honeymoon in June. Nusa Dua is a very strange resort, it is beautiful and impeccably clean, there are large ornamental gates to the resort which is essentially just several high quality hotels down a nice stretch of beach. I say strange because it is just so manicured it doesn't quite feel real. The roundabouts have huge sculptures and water features on them. ", " It feels incredibly secure as all cars must go through a security gate where they are opened and checked by several guards as they enter the resort and again a similar security check at the entrance to the Nusa Dua hotel. ", "The entrance to the hotel and lobby are impressive. We opted for the upgrade to the Palace wing which we would highly recommend. The rooms have large balconies which lead straight out to a beautiful garden with pond and fantastic trees and plants - a little slice of heaven when you wake up in the morning. The room was clean and large with lots of ornamental carving and wooded flooring it certainly felt luxurious. We were very well looked after at the palace club, a short walk across the garden - they tended to your every need and offer DVDS, internet access, all day drinks and butler services, breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails and canap\u00e9s all included in the room upgrade. ", "The rest of the hotel is nice - large but not too big. The beach is nice, though you can't swim in the sea. The pool area was OK but to be honest even with the supposedly low occupancy rates in Bali at the moment we never got chance to sit by it as the beds were always taken. There are plenty more on the beach however. We visited the chess bar for a meal and Raja's twice. Chess bar was fine but we would highly recommend Rajas where we were treated extremely well by the staff and the food was fab. ", "Overall we were very happy with this hotel, it was pretty, very clean and the staff couldn't do more for us. As far as the leading hotels of the world tag goes, I am not quite sure what this means and who awards it, but if you take it literally you may be disappointed, a discerning traveler, used to staying at the worlds finest, will probably find that this does not quite compare.", "We would recommend the hotel though would be unlikely to return to Nusa Dua. This is purely personal preference. As a rule we like to leave our hotel, go for a stroll and pop into a few bars/restaurants etc, there is very little around nusa dua at all and as the weather wasn't great when we were there we felt a bit bored, though it is cheap and easy to get taxis to jimbaran kuta etc and excursions to ubud etc are also cheap and you will get private tours and your own guides which is great. There are also lots of water sports available at Benoa just down the beach.", "\n", "\nThis was the first stop on our honeymoon trip (for 5 nights), this hotel is accredited in the 'best hotels in the world' programme and, having travelled extensively in recent years we can say with confidence it is exactly that!

I had always dreamed we would have a champagne breakfast on the beach during our honeymoon, but this is not something they normally do. They said it would be no problem though, and at 6am a feast of local fruits, cereals, breads and champagne was set on a table on the beach with a some fantastic displays of cerominal flowers and an arch way with our names on with 2 waiters to serve us. Amazing as I only asked the night before!", "A visit to the Spa is a must, we chose the Studio massage for two which seemed pricey at nearly \u00a350 each but was the most relaxing experience in the world we each had a full body massage on beds next to each other with one masseusse each for 1 hour and gives you exclusive use of pool with floating frangiopani flowers, and a sauna, steam room and jacuzzi all in you own exclusive villa that is yours for 2 hours. Amazing....", "The hotel is well placed to make a day trip to Ubud - (a must for a Bali trip), sun set with Balianese dancing at a local cliff top temple (name escapes me!), and just a short walk from the fabulous Bumbai Bali cooking school run by Heinz von Holtzen, classes from \u00a360 each for a full day including a market tour in the morning to collect the produce - very entertaining. Off the beach is also some reasonable coral to explore, well priced beach massage and water sports available too.

For breakfast, we would sit by the pond and watch the birds and fish while we ate nasi and mee goreng. Then we would walk on the walkway which extends along the beach. This walkway connects almost all of the Nusa Dua area hotels.

", "There are so many hotels along Nusa Dua Beach. The Westin was next door. This hotel is more modern. I preferred the NDB Hotel because of a more traditional feel. We also explored the Hyatt which seemed even more manufactured. These hotels could be at any beach (from Hawaii to Phuket), but at least with the NDB Hotel, you knew you were in Bali.

For a couple, looking for a romantic beach vacation, Jimbaran or Legian are nicer.

We chose it as our honeymoon hotel based on reviews and star ratings in brochures, and to be honest we were quite disappointed. We had stayed at the Bali Mandira and the Bali Hilton prior to the wedding, and preferred both of the those to the NDBH. The rooms are quite small, particularly compared to the Hilton, the beach wasn't that great, the pools were cold, the lobby not that spectacular. On the plus side, the buffet breakfast was terrific, but not all that different to the others.

It was not clean either. If the hotel were to be fully booked, one would have to run 'the German way' each morning to get a spot beside the pool. One towel per guest can be considered somewhat poor for \"one of the Leading hotels of the world\". Restaurants were OK but again not that special. Furthermore it was quite obvious that the hotel works with numerous travelagencies who seem to be offering last minutes as well, which was reflected by the general standing of the guests.", "However, the setting and gardens looked great and the Palace Club offers nice drinks and snacks.

We loved the hotel and the staff couldn't do enough for us. The hotel has great character and is not what you would call truly modern but that added to the charm of the place. You felt like you were in Bali and not anywhere in the world which some of the other hotels seemed to appear as. The rooms are very well equipped and comfortable. The Palace Club is worth the extra money which includes afternoon tea with sandwiches, cakes and then cocktails in the evening with hors d'oeuvres. The staff there all speak English perfectly and there is entertainment most evenings. There are a variety of restaurants so you can choose what you want from Pizza through to 5* cuisine. The grounds and the Spa are beautiful. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a relaxing and self-indulgent holiday. We came back very relaxed. Again, we were bowled over by how charming, efficient and friendly the staff were. It is well worth a holiday.", "\n", "\nWe have just returned from 9 nights at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and could not recommend it highly enough.

So many watersport options available at a great price and a breakfast buffet to remember !! The staff were so friendly and genuine. We travelled with our two sons 9 and 7. The Gecko club was perfect for the 7 yr old but did not hold heaps of interest for the 9 yr old. We have suggested to the Hotel that they look at ways of catering to slightly older children as well. We are going back in Sept 06 and are counting the days.", "\n", "\nFirst, the good things :", "1) as my wife and I celebrated our 1st Anniversary in Bali, the hotel granted us an upgrade for a Deluxe Room instead of the Superior we paid for.

No, one-meter sandy path!", "So, please if you come to Bali, avoid Nusa Dua, unless you want to stay in Disneyland: No Bali atmosphere, sellers on the beach with numbers on their back: In case you would have a problem with one of them, it\u2019d be easier to find out with whom you got an issue\u2026 Just shoking as it does remember me a bad period of History during WWII!\n", "\nWe had a lovely stay at The Nusa Dua.", "Bali itself was not what I expected. The beaches were very crowded and we were not able to swim, because the water was quite cold with lots of sea weed. ", "However our hotel was great. We upgraded before we went to a palace room, which I very highly recommend. It included breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. We therefore had to spend very little on extras. Our bill for 9 days was \u00a3120, and we were room only. Not bad for \u00a318 to upgrade. ", "The food in the hotel was lovely. The Pizza's are to die for.

I also found it to be cheaper than most of the other hotels in Nusa Dua. ", "We had a Family Room (Superior Room) for 4, which consisted of 2 rooms with an interconnecting door. There was a King bed in the main bedroom and twin beds in the 2nd bedroom. It had 2 bathrooms (1 with a bath). We requested a ground floor room, close to the pool which we got. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable, but certainly not \u2018luxurious\u2019. If you want absolute 5* luxury it would be better to get one of the Palace Club rooms or suites. We had a look at these before we left and they are wonderful plus you get all the club benefits such as free 24hr non-alcoholic drinks, afternoon tea and drinks and hors d'eouvres in the evening. ", "Overall, we were very impressed with the NDBH. The entrance and grounds are beautiful and well maintained. Lovely gardens, pools, statues and water features. The staff are wonderful \u2013 very friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast is included at the Wedang Jaye restaurant. This is a lovely setting overlooking a large pond and gardens. There is a good choice of food and eggs are prepared fresh anyway you like them. Bottled water is provided free of charge in your room. We requested more water and this was no problem. There is a fully stocked mini-bar in the rooms and tea and coffee making facilities are provided but no fresh milk. The rooms also have Australian power outlets in the bedroom and bathroom so you don\u2019t need to bring an adapter! ", "The hotel has good facilities for children including a playground, kiddies pool, babysitting service and Gekkos Kids Club (free for hotel guests). The kids club is very clean, bright and well run by qualified staff. They have an interesting program of activities which changes daily.", "The Nusa Dua Spa is wonderful. We used the gym, spa, sauna and steam room facilities which are all very nice. I also indulged in one of their spa packages which was fantastic - the spa pavillions are very tranquil.", "\n", "\nI just came back yesterday from Bali, where I stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa. I read countless reviews on Trip Advisor before deciding where to stay - Sheraton at Nusa Dua was my first choice, but it was fully booked, so after reading lots of good reviews of Nusa Dua hotel, I decided to book it. Thanks to the reviews, nothing surprised me at the hotel - good service, very comfortable rooms, good breakfast (though I didn't like the beef bacon, give me pork anytime!), nice beachfront, good value for money. The hotel is quite old, but you won't really feel it cos its very well maintained. I read some people say that Nusa Dua had a white sandy beach - its hardly white, more like light golden brown, but its pleasant enough. Its also a bit out of the way - 2-way taxi to Ubud costs 300,000 rupiah. But overall, we're very statisfied with our stay here.", "\n"]

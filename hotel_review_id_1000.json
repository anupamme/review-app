The rooms were overly spacious with bamboo flooring and a wonderful big marble bathroom with seperate toilet and shower. Every room overlooked the pool. Our husbands enjoyed the open air bar with pool table to relax with a few bintangs, my girlfriend and i preferred to make the most of the in house spa which was both boutique and enduring and very reasonably priced. Although the hotel is in Nusa Dua, its certainly not the big flash hotels you would normally expect of Nusa and is well away from all the big 5 Star on the beach type of resorts, but that didnt bother us as the hotel was quaint and cozy, it also has a free shuttle down to 'their' own beach club decked out with bar which you can order food from and sun lounges positioned under thatched huts for shaded relaxation on the beach. Shops werent directly out the front door from the resort but a 500m walk down the road takes you to some wonderful restaurants and shops to buy all your bargains. Although not central to shops, restaurants and the hype bali provides, we found this hotel a nice quiet place to return after busy shopping in kuta. The staff were more than helpful and friendly, the food was wonderful (no bali belly) which was a nice relief. If you want to tour the island the staff are more than willing to set you up with a driver (a family friend in most cases). Over a few bintangs in the open air sports bar one of the staff offered for one of his brothers to take our husbands to a surfing beach up on the coast and even arranged boards for them, which they enjoyed. I highly recommend this hotel if you dont mind being a bit out of the way from all the hype that bali offers, and just want to chill out by the pool or over a beverage in the bar area.

The staff were friendly, helpful and charming - always smiling and welcoming and very quick to sort out any problems. We had a disaster with the shower which was literally spraying the walls but one phonecall and the plumber was there in about ten minutes. We booked a one bedroom villa and were given a two bedroom villa (with the second room locked) which meant we had so much space and a larger pool. Other reviews say how big the rooms are and they are right. Our villa was serviced every day by a lovely man who kept it spotless. The pool men came each morning and we had visits from the gardener to keep the plants under control. In the evening someone came to spray the bedroom for mossies and to light the mossie coil in the living area - you really did not need to lift a finger. I simply do not understand the bad review below - doesn't sound like the same place. The breakfast could be cooked for you in your villa each mornng or you could eat in the restaurant. We did both and our only complaint was \"too much food\"! We didn't have dinner there - the Villas are in such a great location that you can reach many restaurants in the area. Try Pearl - it's a real gem! The beach was a fifteen minute walk - or by taxi about five minutes but that depends on the traffic.

The hotel is close to restaurants, bars and within easy distance to Kuta and Seminyak. The room was average size with a nice balcony and kept extremely clean.

We specifically asked for a room on the top floor, however, ans many readers have mentioned there is no lift......The buffet breakfast was adequate however a bit repetative after six mornings. One slight issue was the toaster it was known when we arrived the first moring that it was not working properly and that was still the case when we left - could sometimes take 10 minutes to get a slice of toast. The pool area was nice however the main let down of the hotel in my mind was the pool itself - being in the shade it was cold, not a pleasant temperture that allowed you to relax.

The last days we wanted to relax in the sun flat out before heading back. All of the resorts in Nusa Dua seem to offer more or less the same - large pool areas with sunbeds, own beaches with sunbeds, 4-6 restaurants with various themes. Westin was nothing different from the neighbouring resorts. Westin is very family friendly and thus attracts alot of families with small children. As we were a young couple we found some quieter spots around the resort which we enjoyed. If staying around the busy pool area it seemed a bit challenging to relax due to the activity level. It is indeed possible to stay at the resort and get a bit peace and quiet. When we arrived at the hotel we were swifly checked-in and followed to the room in the new part of the resort complex (premium rooms). The room was spacious with mini bar, AC, large closet, satelitte TV, large bathroom with bath tub and huge shower. The room was clean. Room service came every afternoon to offer additional towers. We did not use any other facilities on the hotel than the beach. The beach on the resort lost the sun around 16:30, which was fine for us after 6-7 hours in the sun, but the professional sun bathers might want to consider a hotel on the opposite side of Nusa Dua than the Westin. The breakfast on the hotel was very good with everything you could ever want, but very busy with all the hotel guests - queues and people everywhere. Room service breakfast for approximately the same price and without the risk of overeating on the tempting buffet station. The service at the hotel was excellent and all employees very friendly.

The bigger club is for kids 4 and above with the exception being kids 2-4 can join as long as their are 1) with a parent or caregiver and 2) fully toilet trained. I completely understand the first part as supervision is essential for the safety of the child and the children in the club. I could not for the life of me understand part 2. I was told by the staff on multiple occasions that my son was welcome to stay but only if i removed his nappy. My son is 99.9% toilet trained. I told them the nappy was on as we were not in a familiar space and he may have an accident and I would hate for him to have it on the equipment. They repeatedly told me that it didn't matter and he could only stay if I took it off. It does not make sense to me that staff would want to encourage people to let their children have accidents rather than supervise them and ensure the kids club stays safe and clean. I did read other reviews about this \"problem\" before arriving and would have hoped it would be solved. May people with young children have them close in age and it is quite silly for a resort that is so kid friendly to force parents to separate their children.

First thing upon check in was them having her and our groups photography taken to distribute it to the different restaurants on the hotel premises. They had menus where it was clearly stated what she could eat and not, at all times they would answer any question regarding her diet and if the staff did not know or where not sure, they would go and at most times get back with a proper answer. At any buffet we visited, the responsible manager of the buffet personally guided us through the buffet showing her what she could eat and not. The quality of the food was so good, made mostly from scratch apparently as she could eat almost everything at most meals, which to me is a sign of good quality restaurants.

The location was not far from the main centre of Kuta 20-30 mins so if you wanted to do something there it wasn't a problem (use the blue taxis as they are metered and we went to Splash water park which was a good 40 min away and cost $9- \"heery\" was our driver and was lovely, very good English) The staff (& there was plenty of them) we very helpful polite happy people.. They went out of there way to do anything they could to help you. Matt and others at the pool bar were lovely and gave frozen watermelon Popsicles and slush puppies free of charge to the children which was a lovely added touch!! Our room service was amazing and every detail was beautiful!! The pools and resort was very moden and luxurious... From checkin to check out our stay at Nusa Dua was lovely... There was security everywhere from the moment you got through the gates at nusa dua. They aren't intrusive at all. The grounds at the Westin and right along the beach front to all the other resorts was nothing but immaculate!!!! The Indonesian people were extremely lovely people and I would recommend coming here to nusa dua if you want a lovely relaxing family holiday... Our kids loved the water slide at the Westin and gave the fishing a go at the Kids Club... Although our kids didn't use the kids club I've only heard how great it is there... There was a playground and Rock climbing wall inside the kids club as well as an enormous amount of activities to do every day that ranged from kids yoga to weaving to braclet making.. There was even a \"teens club\" that had mini golf, bike riding, soccer etc etc etc to keep the older kids busy..... The only complaint we had was that the drinks (soft drinks/beers) were always hot at every restaurant and bar at nusa dua (not just at the Westin) we thought maybe stubbie holders could be given out when purchasing a drink or a bucket of ice to keep your drinks cool whilst your swimming/dining. The fridge in both our rooms weren't very cold but we didn't complain as it wasn't a major issue due to the fact we wernt drinking anything out of them..

It is the oldest hotel in Seminyak and is regarded as \"old Bali\". It has a reputation for luxury that is however undeserved.

Ceiling fans, insect screens and above most else, a spectacular breakfast, shoud be provided. The pool is relativley small by modern hotel standards. Breakfast is served outdoors and slowly. One morning I believed it was going to rain but the staff said no. Shortly after that it poured and the wet patrons had to be moved under cover and breakfast re- organised. It was badly done and suggests a lack of attention to detail and good systems. The hotel car system works well but the drivers' local knowledge was lacking and some guests I knew were lost.

But, there are a couple of things - such as the sewer smell on the grounds of the hotel and the garbage on the beach - that weren't there before, and aren't at some of the alternative destinations we like to go. I didn't like the answer I got about the sewer smell (see the 'What has changed?' section below) from the hotel staff, and that's too bad because you can't 'cover up' or ignore issues like strong smells and expect guests to simply ignore the smells and keep coming back. I would have appreciated a more direct answer, that felt more honest, versus the one I got which was (in my opinion) somewhat evasive.", "What hasn't changed:", "- The Oberoi's staff is still amazingly attentive, sincere, friendly, and thoroughly committed to making your visit as great as it can be.

World class. And he is happy to work with you to create special meals. We had the 'Romantic Dinner' on the beach for our actual anniversary (they set up a table, ringed with candles in the sand) and it was incredible.", "- The staff that takes care of your room must be trained as mind readers because they do things before you ask them, or would never think to ask them. I'll never forget coming back to the room after our first day at the pool and every power cord had been rolled up and secured with a strip of Velcro. Another example is when we took a bath before dinner and used the entire jar of bath salts. After dinner, of course, the jar was full again. The funniest thing that happened in the room was when we called room service for a bucket of ice. 5 minutes later they were at the room. As they handed us the bucket, they asked if they could have the other one back. We looked in the bar and there was already a bucket full of ice there. We checked every day after that and it was clear they were filling that bucket up with fresh ice every day.", "- The pool and beach are amazing. Get to the pool early and reserve your favorite loungers. The staff will set them up for you. Watch out for the ocean waves. They are bigger than you think.", "- There are still a lot of great restaurants in the area (easily reachable by walking) if you want to save some money or get something simpler. Our favorite by far is the Ku De Ta right next to the Oberoi to the North West on the beach. The drinks are amazing, as is the food. Try the pitcher of Pink Sangria. We begged for the recipe and have been making it at home since we got back.", "- The cost of hiring a car, driver, and guide is still amazingly low. About $100 USD per day. They have prearranged tours our will take you wherever you want to go. The only caveat is that the prearranged tours always seem stop at places that demonstrate crafts like woodworking on the face of things, but are really about selling their products to you. It's pretty clear that there is a relationship between these places and the Oberoi and it gets a little tedious as the shops don't really want to let you leave easily and your driver sometimes becomes a little hard to find. Also, the restaurants where they stop for lunch tend to be OK, but very expensive. This time we told the driver to not go anywhere that would try to sell us things, and we picked our own lunch spot.", "- The Balinese countryside is still unchanged and amazing. Get out into the country! Experience the people! We haven't found a place yet that isn't colorful and full of great people. ", "- The Oberoi still brings in craftsmen and dance/music groups. If you have never seen Balinese dance or heard the Gamelan music, you can't imagine what it's like!", "What has changed:", "- It pains me to write this, but we were there for about 10 days and there was a prominent sewer smell on the hotel's property for most of them. It came and went with the direction of the wind, but was clearly present at some point of every day. It's hard to sit on a lounger overlooking the Indian Ocean and have a stench overtake you. I wrote an e-mail to the executive management and let them know that the smell was really detracting from our stay. The response was basically that there are rivers that flow past both sides of the property and into the ocean, and these rivers have 'natural' organisms that cause the smell and are unavoidable. In find this explanation hard to believe for several reasons: (1) there was no smell during our prior two visits - which were at the same time of year (2) it's a sad fact that plumbing isn't widespread in Bali's countryside and sewage does end up in the rivers and flows to the ocean, especially when it rains during the day, so I don't think the smells were really 'natural' and (3) the hotel was working on some kind of sewer system upgrade when we were there - coincidence? Hard to say. But hard to rule out. The bottom line is that we love Bali and the Oberoi, but the smell isn't something we can ignore, and I don't think we will go back to Bali and the Oberoi until we can verify that the smell is gone. ", "This is also my only real complaint about the management staff at the hotel. They are truly amazing people, but I don't feel like I got a satisfactory answer about the smell. I understand why they wouldn't want to talk much about such a thing, but they need to acknowledge the issue, and they have to figure out a way to deal with it regardless of the source.", "- The beaches had far more trash on them than either my wife or I could remember from prior visits. As the tides would come in and out, lines of all sorts of trash would be left on the beach. This wasn't an issue in front of any of the major hotels as they clearly had people raking the beach at the right times. The Oberoi's beach was (of course) spotless. But, if you walk a mile on the beach, you will experience trash for at least 1/2 of your walk. Some days are worse than others, but there is always trash at the high water mark. Given the low cost of labor in Bali, the government would be doing a big thing to protect the tourism industry if it simply paid some people to rake the beaches in their entirety around the main tourist centers.", "- Seminyak (and surrounding areas like Legian) have become far busier. It looks like a number of new hotels have been built and this has caused the areas to become more crowded with people. That said, more people means more shops and restaurants - and we walked into these parts of the area almost daily (where we didn't do that in the past - there wasn't much that was interesting close by).", "- A side effect of the growth in the area is that the Oberoi felt much more like a walled oasis in a busy place than in the past, where the Oberoi felt like a great hotel on a beach amongst other hotels on the beach. My wife and I both noted that the Oberoi was like a paradise, but that it was hard to forget that when you walked out of the front gate, you were in a busy Indonesian city.", "I hope this is helpful!\n"], "stars": "5", "title": null}, "55": {"description": ["\nMy wife and I checked into the Oberoi after spending three weeks at two other magnificent hotels in Bali, one in Nusa Dua and the other in Ubud.

The Oberoi has done a superb job in taking this inherent grace of the Balinese to a more refined level. It's obvious that the staff training by the company is of the utmost quality. The staff make absolutely certain that we who stay there are completely cared for. From the meal staff, to the pool and beach staff and to those who kept our room and did out laundry, everyone there was completely of service.

The hotel have previously responded to comments like this by saying the breakfast is priced in line with alternatives (which I think is a bit unfair), and that if you want breakfast included pay for a higher room rate - I would say find the cheapest room you can, and eat and drink everything else 10 minutes away in seminyak, there are many great alternatives to give you more variety, and you will save money.

I was going to wait until I left, but having reread many of the recent reviews, I thought I'd add mine now as first impressions often make/break an experience. My husband and I just rediscovered Bali 2 years ago after travelling to the States and Europe many times. We love the \"grunginess\" mixed with great accomodation and even better restaurants as well as the gorgeous people! We've stayed in 5*villas and the Mulia (soulless) so far and this is by far the most beautiful. The grounds are simple, elegant and immaculate. You feel like you're in Bali rather than some overcrowded, super-modern hotel that could be anywhere in the world. Of course this has its pro's and con's like most things do. ", "CONS - The villas and lanai's are all single level and dotted in groups throughout the grounds straddling a wide stretch of beach which is nice. Interestingly there are almost no photos of the standard rooms, either with ocean view or without it, on their website. This is for a reason! They are simple in the extreme. I am assuming that I have their most basic room (hopefully!) as I purchased a special deal - still US$300 plus 21% tax room only. It's small and uninspiring. The whole space, inc bath and terrace may be 60sqm but the room is lucky to be 20-25msq. The shower is over the dated sunken bath which looks over a small walled garden. There could have been a nice second open air shower here which is a missed opportunity to ramp it up. Everything is however spotless, although the shower head leaks like a sieve which someone else commented on! To make it even better, the door only shuts from the inside as the handles are fixed and therefore light from he outside garden streams in on a morning through the opening. There is nothing glamorous or 5* about the space at all. Basic cane sofa and chair are more 3* than 5, and not one piece of artwork on the bare white wall in the room . The ceiling doesn't rake up either as shown in photos but is a flat rattan one. No cushions on the bed, no colour even subtle except for the bed head, which is a silk screen print. Tiny minibar, and plunger coffee only. Surely with only 78 rooms you could have a Nespresso these days? The bed is also like a rock and I like a firmer mattress! There are two chairs with bottle green seats and a teak table on the terrace when there could have been two sun beds for some privacy if you didn't feel like lounging around the pool. I don't hate it but iim just disappointed. I'd expected so much more from an Oberoi. Just altogether VERY underwhelming. ", "Also because it's a relatively small hotel, which I like, there are a lot less facilities than at the larger properties in Nusa Dua or at the W. This is not a kid friendly hotel as their are no organised activities and only one smallish rectangular pool. This does however make it great for couples of all ages.", "The food and drinks are Australian prices which I object to when the staff are paid Bali wages, as at the Mulia (5* too) all the food was very reasonable and the choice of restaurant fantastic. Here there are only two and the food so far is nice, but not fantastic. Consequently they are empty as in Seminyak you are spoilt for choice.", "PROS - lovely staff, gorgeous grounds, best spot on the beach half way to everything in Seiminyak and Kerebokan. ", "Spa is small but looks nice - am going tomorrow. Prices seem reasonable for 5* property.", "So wanted to love it all! Don't think I'd return until rooms , whilst they can't get bigger, gets total overhaul. Just a feeling the hotel is resting on its name.

", "On arrival at Dempasar airport, I was exhausted after 27 hours in transit and a very full-blown wedding two days previously. The moment we were met by the hotel's air-conditioned car and given water and towels to wash our face, I started to relax.

It reminded me of a palace or a temple, all ponds and walkways and open spaces - a far cry from a lot of soulless expensive resorts. We were seated in the outdoor reception area and given a neck garland and a welcome cocktail while we checked in, which made something that can sometimes be a chore feel like the start of a holiday. ", "Our room was amazing. There was an absolutely huge four-poster bed - I think it could have slept about six people - a front garden, a back garden and a mini garden by the bathroom, and statues and fish ponds everywhere. The bathroom had a powerful shower and a huge bath that was clearly designed for sharing! Most impressively, there was a more or less full-length pool, not the sort of half-hearted affair you can sometimes get with pool villas. There was also a lovely veranda area that was perfect for secluded dinner and drinks a deux. ", "The villa was completely secluded, with high walls and a lockable gate to separate it from the rest of the hotel - perfect if you want a bit of privacy and peace and quiet. As it was our honeymoon, we spent a lot of time enjoying this seclusion - sunbathing by and swimming in our pool, then ordering room service food and drink to enjoy on the veranda. Room service was no more expensive than eating in the hotel restaurant, and the staff were happy to set our table up with tableclothes and candles and things. I\u2019d highly recommend going for one of the pool villas if you can, but the main pool area was lovely too. ", "One thing I hate is when you've paid a lot for a nice hotel, and then it tries to rip you off on little things, making you feel like a cash cow rather than a guest. While the Oberoi is by no means an all-inclusive hotel, I really appreciated the way lots of little free treats were provided, like ice-cream by the pool or afternoon tea or a \"meet the manager\" cocktail evening. Other little touches included suncream and water being put out for us on our sunloungers each morning and a bowl of fresh fruit being bought to the room each day. Everything was beautifully presented and all staff, from the manager to the concierges to the cleaners just couldn't do enough to help. On arrival, we found our bed covered in flowers and a cake, card and bear waiting for us.", " ", "We were definitely there for a relaxing, coupley holiday rather than a cultural tour, but it would be a shame to have come to somewhere with as much history and tradition as Bali and not seen some of it. I therefore liked the way that the hotel brought culture to you. Every afternoon, there was afternoon tea and a demonstration of an aspect of Balinese culture in the outdoor ampitheatre - dancing, the making of offerings, music etc. You could just wander straight from the pool or the beach and soak this up. More formally, on two evenings there were organised shows in the ampitheatre. We made it to one of them - a performance of the Ramyana - and enjoyed both watching the performance and eating the Indonesian all you can eat feast that accompanied it! ", "More adventurously, the hotel did offer individual tours. We took part in one of these, which involved seeing a monkey forest, a royal temple and the famous Tanah Lot sea temple. The two of us were driven from place to place in a car provided by the hotel, and accompanied by our own entertaining and knowledgeable guide. This was a very interesting day, and on a different sot of holiday, we'd probably have tried out some of the other tours. ", "My one slight complaint would be that the breakfast seemed extraordinarily pricey, not only compared to that on offer in the town (which is probably to be expected) but to hotels I've stayed in in Europe and to the place I often go to for brunch in Chelsea! It was tasty and it did come with a good sea view, but most days, we wandered into the town, which had some great breakfast venues. Other meals, although also expensive, felt like relatively better value - particularly the Indonesian feast I mentioned above, which was about the same price as breakfast. On a similar note, the spa was lovely and I'd recommend a visit, but it's also worth visiting Bodyworks in town, which were also good and offered similar treatments at a much lower price. ", "So that's an almost 100% vote of confidence for the hotel itself. Just for reference, I was slightly less overjoyed with some of the things the hotel had no control over. The sea was incredibly wavey, great for a dramatic view and for people who want to surf or bodyboard (which we tried one day using a board borrowed from the hotel) but not so good for those wanting to swim in it, which would have been my preference. I also had mixed feelings about the town, which seemed to have undergone too much development too fast, leaving to it feeling a bit soulless. The beauty of the hotel was not mirrored by many of the buildings out in town. That said, there were some really nice places to eat and drink.

FS Jimbaran: Amazing property, beautiful gardens, best service (like in all the FS that we have already visit), great hospitality, very big and nice appointed villas with private pools, very good quality of the food. Fantastic new beach club with super nice and cosy restaurant Sundara! The resort is kids friendly with a wide range of activities for the young guests.

YES because the hospitality of the staff, the service and Sundara are unforgettable and makes you feel special. ", "2. Saint Regis Nusa Dua: very luxurious new hotel with outstanding lobby, main pool and spa. We had a fabulous room (ocean view suite) with top fourniture. The breakfast is an incredible experience (try the lobster omlette). Our daughter was delighted by the kids club. We must say that the children learning center is perfect. The concept is super interesting because it is more like a preschool. Many thanks to all the staff of the CLC ( WAYAN JUARNASIH, CECILA DEWAYANTI, CAHYA) You are doing a great work!!!) The overall experience is very nice but the problem is Nusa Dua because it is a puzzle of resorts without any Balinese spirit. Will we come back? Yes", "3. The Chedi Club: After reading all the super opinions about the hotel on Trip Advisor I must say that our expectations were very high. The Chedi is really ok, but nothing so so special. It is a small hotel with positive vibrations but... The Villas are little bit old (problem with WC and shower) and the only one restaurant is quite poor. A big advantage is the butler service. You have a butler for your own disposal. Our butler was very friendly and gave us many good advices. But the main advantage is Ubud with a incredible Balinese spirit. Many superb restaurants and beautiful places to visit. Will we come back? To Ubud for sure, but not to the Chedi Club. ", "4. The Oberoi Seminyak: When I booked the hotel, our last destination in Bali in my head was the cherry on the top. From many friends I have heard many good things about the Oberoi hotels in the world. Unfortunately the Oberoi Seminyak was a total disappointment. Let\u2019s start by the positives: ocean front location, well maintained property and Seminyak with all the gorgeous restaurants and night clubs... Now the negatives: The hotel is old, really old!!! I do perfectly understand the meaning of classic luxury ( many time we have spent our holidays in hotels like the Carlton or the Martinez in Cannes\u2026) but this hotel extremely needs to be refurbished. The rooms are small (our was a ocean view villa) with super old smelly furniture (the phones are from the 80\u2019s!!!). The staff is tired as the hotel. They try to pretend to be nice but believe me that they are bad actors!)\u2026The worst are the breakfast. Very limited \u201ca la carte\u201d choice. The food is not healthy. Everything is fat and disgusting. The juices are from bottles. The fruits are not fresh and served hot. Imagine that one day we found ants in the jam. The staff was not even surprised \uf04a. Ok. After a short talk with the manger they gave us the breakfast for free, but this is really not the point. For me in a hotel of this class this is unacceptable. The price of the food compare to the quality in other hotels and restaurants in Seminyak is a joke. You have only one very crowded pool with hot (not fresh) water. The hotel is child unfriendly. There is NOTHING for children. I do understand that some hotels do not want to have young guests but in such case why put information on the web site that there are kids activities? The check in and the check out was slow and also unfriendly. In that hotel you feel all the time that the staff do not really have the envy to work.

Some other things though detracted from the experience and left me a bit disappointed that the Oberoi didn't match the standard of the property I stayed at in Ubud. ", "While overall they were minor irritations, for a hotel that strives to be 'perfect' (as one of the managers told me) they didn't quite meet that standard for me. Dining at the Oberoi is very expensive and the two light meals I had there were of average taste and not good value by Bali standards. At certain times of the day the pool area was at capacity and no sun lounges were available. This meant that on one occasion when I wanted to have a swim I had to sit on the grass until a lounge became free; on some other days I had to put my swim back a few hours until later in the afternoon when it was quieter.

If you're short like me you almost need something to stand on to be able to get into bed, and if you're not careful you can get a nasty knock on your knee from the ledge (which I did). The beds don't have mosquito nets, so you need to spray the room each night to deal with the bugs that have come in. There is also the strange situation at the Oberoi Spa where one of the change rooms available to male and female clients used to the men's locker room and comes complete with urinals! I was advised this was a quirk left over from the original hotel architecture but as a female traveller it was a surprise to come across this 'feature' in a five-star spa.", "On balance the Oberoi is a very good hotel but it is competing against some other exceptional hotels in Bali.

The lush green grounds are beautiful and the location is really good. Lovely beachfront facing. The pool is pretty and relaxing to lounge around - helped by a regular supply of mineral water and fresh fruit skewers and sorbets brought by the friendly staff. We tried the gym and it was decent - if a bit too hot! The room we stayed in wasn't amazing but nice enough and the bathroom was really big - good shower and bath. My only gripe about the room was the bed - way too high with a wooden ledge jutting out at each side of the bed. And of course, I bashed my leg off it! I consider myself fairly agile and it was difficult for me to get in at night. Not sure if all rooms have similar beds - I wouldn't have thought so. The service was, for the most part, really good. A slight slip up at breakfast when it had rained and it seemed everyone headed for breakfast at 10.30am when breakfast ends at 11am. My only real disappointment was the hotel's attitude to late check out. I don't expect late check out to be automatically available but I would have expected alternative arrangements to be easily put in place. They couldn't allow us late check out as our room was due to be taken. They said they could move us to another room for 4 hours (when we needed to leave) for a half day room charge (US$220). I asked if they had any other facilities where we could just shower but they said maybe the spa, maybe somewhere else but I needed to let them know the exact time. This just annoyed me as this must happen all the time. However, we've come across this same problem in other busy hotels in Asia. I just think 5 star hotels should have facilities available for this sort of thing. I mean we pay enough for the rooms. All in all, we had a really lovely trip and love Bali. I'm not sure we'd rush back to this hotel as there are so many other good hotels in Bali but I'm sure anyone who stays here will have a lovely holiday.

This was our first stop in Bali, and driving through noisy dirty Seminyak, we couldn't wait to reach our 5-star hotel. The welcome drink and outdoor check-in was very nice, but things went downhill from there. I must say first that the grounds and architecture are very beautiful and traditional. But after flying for 16 hours, the last thing we wanted was a 25 minute tour of both the property and our room, reviewing every drawer, light switch, towel, remote control, etc. We travel a lot and it was just overkill. The staff is nice but seemed totally amateur, confirming requests 3 times without leaving you feeling confident that they got what you asked for. We almost made the assumption that we did not like the Balinese people, but now having left the Oberoi, I realize it was only their mostly awkward staff that we didn't connect with. ", "We stayed for 3 nights and were pretty jetlagged so we spent the first 2 days eating our meals at the hotel like fools! We should have known better but we were lazy. The food was good, but took forever and it is so incredibly overpriced. On our third day, we left for both lunch and dinner, ate like kings, and paid a fraction of the price. We expected prices to be lower outside of the hotel, but not by half. That was extremely disappointing and we really felt swindled. ", "Others have mentioned the bed being surrounded by a wood platform - I have a bruise the size of a golf ball on my shin that has not gone away. Just a terrible design, and they should at the very least not drape the comforter over the wood so you can see what the deal is...or have the staff point that out during your extended room tour. That was the one detail we would have actually appreciated being warned about!", "To boot, the beach stunk of sewage.

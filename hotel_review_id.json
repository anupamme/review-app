Bali Garden is located in the somewhat more quite southern part of the city. Once in the resort, the bustling main street behind is easily forgotten. The staff is extremely friendly. After sunset the resort is quickly transformed into one big open dining space provided with high quality live entertainment. The food is really great, next to great Indonesian dishes, numerous western choices are possible. The (family)rooms are spacious. One thing to consider when visiting Kuta is the big Aussie population. Also in the relatively expensive Bali Garden Resort it was inevitable to run into groups of tattooed Aussies that opened their first Bintangs straight after breakfast by the poolside.\n"

I was really disappointed as one of the great things I enjoy about Bali is getting to know the bar staff, having a chat, learning about the place and getting great service. Forget that here, the pool bar staff were getting flogged every day!! Not their fault but getting a drink at the bar was hopelessly slow. Faster getting a drink at the pool with no swim up bar. ",

The Bali style of the staff being so friendly and helpful at resorts seemed to be forgotten at this resort and we all felt as if all the weddings were priority, and others were just made to fit in where you could.

                "\nThis resort is in the heart of everything and is surrounded by beautiful gardens on their estate that reach all the way to the beach. There are hundreds of goldfish and huge ponds and even a komodo dragon swimming around which the kids can watch while they're eating breakfast. Located next door to the Discovery Mall and only 300 metres to Kuta Square with the Matahari Department store and McDonald's, this is the place to be if you want to be in the heart of good shopping. The discovery mall contains 'Breadtalk' which is a bakery where most gourmet items are only 80 cents each, so an excellent place to buy lunch for the family. It is opposite Waterbom Park however most of the rides are too extreme for little kids. There are three swimming pools, an infinity pool by the beach, a main swimming pool with a swim up bar and concrete chairs and tables in the water, and a swimming pool that's for adults only with a spa, so no annoying kids. Unfortunately I didn't get to utilise that one! The only criticism I have is that there was no wifi in the rooms. If you wanted it in your room you had to pay 10 dollars a day. The free wifi was down the back of the property by the pool. You were only allocated a password for 30 minutes a day which doesn't go far when you have to do your banking etc. Snd the wifi is dodgy. In hindsight this is a blessing in disguise as it gets your children out of the hotel room, off their ipads and exercising in the swimming pool.\n"

The rooms were spacious and clean with comfy beds. The adult pool was good but not enough sunlounges and the main pool was awful with lots and lots of 'Bogan' Aussies and splashing children everywhere!! The food in the Boardwalk restaurant was ok, breakfast was pretty good, but get in early as it fills up with lots of annoying people by 8:30am. I would recommend this hotel for a very short stay if you were wanting to go to Kuta, but I would never stay in Kuta again as there are SOOO many other beautiful parts of Bali to holiday in. Too noisy overall rating. ( 7 ladies age 33 - 43 )\n"

The superior room we had was perfectly clean and reasonably spacious although a little dated. The pools and beach café were great, no problems with the prices or the food, we ate there once or twice. I have to mention again that there were also many great places to eat within a minute or two of the hotel entrance. After staying elsewhere in a smaller boutique resort in a much quieter location before arriving at the Bali Garden, the staff were not as attentive as we had experienced, but it was in peak season and the hotel was at capacity, so it was understandable. If I had anything negative to say it would be that the access to wifi wasn't fantastic. It dropped out regularly and was difficult to just upload a couple of photos or get in touch with teenage children back home.

Tari Spa at the resort is excellent -with a choice of air conditioned rooms for treatments, or an outside garden area. The cream bath is to die for & just what is needed before flying home to get all the chlorine out of your hair.

The bedroom portion of the room was wonderful! The bathroom was dingy. The bath would not drain when you showered and the grout lines were crumbling and grimy. They do not provide conditioner or lotion so make sure and bring your own. The poolside service was wonderful and all of their food and drinks were a great value. Drinks were so reasonably priced that we didn't feel the need to keep our own drinks in our room like we do at most resorts. The restaurant food was fabulous! Wine is expensive...it is everywhere in Bali...even at the grocery. The lounge of the lobby was awesome and is a great place to hang out if you have any work to do. Take note - they say they close at midnight but stop serving everything at about 11:30 - including water. The only disappointment is that their wi-fi service is terrible from the rooms and is not free as they claim on most sites. They offer a free 30 minutes but it takes at least that long to get connected, figure out passwords, etc. to their service and was used up before I could even do any work. Even then the front reception had to take over and do it for me. It took him about an hour to get it sorted out and working. The free wi-fi at the pool & restaurant are also non-existent. They just don't work. Even if you have their password. The only place you get a strong signal is if you park it in the lobby. The signal is acceptable in the lounge.

Just 10 minutes from the airport but a great location, right on the beach, with the pool area, sun beds, restaurant and beach bar right up to the board walk. Many people walked by while we were there, engaged in conversation with other residents and all I heard was positive comments. There are three pools, one adults only tranquil area, one big pool with a sit in bar and another almost on the beach. The bar food and drinks were great and so cheap. The rooms were large, perhaps a bit old, but that added to the charm. The name Bali Garden is a perfect description, the hotel is situated in fantastic garden grounds, so well maintained. A couple of downers which took the edge off things , the breakfast was not so special, but no big deal. The most frustrating thing was the wifi. They really must get wifi throughout the hotel, really quite annoying to have to depend on different codes on minute slips of paper in differing areas of the hotel. (That's why a 4 star very good and not a 5 star excellent) Watch out if you are staying on business. Best time of the day was around 6am for Internet before it got busy. Apart from that, hotel was really good and best of all, the staff were fantastic, so service orientated and they really appeared to be enjoying themselves. Plenty of shops along the beach too, and many restaurants too, and right across the road from ATM's. Definitely worth a try.\n"

The front desk clerk still wouldn't believe us when we told him we didn't use the internet service and even showed us the slip of paper that had what they thought was my signature. We showed him my passport and another valid ID so he can compare my signature with that on the paper.

                "\nI am not sure how to review this hotel, some good points and some really bad, Great sunsets! The pools, adult pool, cool water, quiet, nice, main pool, warm water, swim up bar is next to the baby pool, not nice to have a drink while kids are playing and screaming around you, we had to tell a couple of excited young boys to take their game of \"throw the ball\" away from us, where were their parents? There is another pool near the boardwalk which is nice and cool but not very private. The grounds are beautiful with plenty of greenery hence the name Bali Gardens. The food at the Boardwalk restaurant is great, tasty and affordable and varied, drinks are cheap. Breakfast is noisy with conversation but nice. The rooms are neat and clean, however the noisy staff outside your door in the hallway in the early mornings is a bit annoying and not very considerate. Don't swim in the ocean as there is rubbish everywhere, My wife and I are middle aged and we had our teenage daughter and her friend with us this time in Bali. This was our first stay in Kuta at Bali Gardens but prefer the quieter Benoa hotels. After this taste of Kuta and this accommodation I would not recommend families that like it quiet, if you are ok with 20 something, mostly aussies, drinking heaps, covered in tattoos and caps on backwards wearing Bintang t-shirts you will fit in, it's ok but not for my family. My wife would like to thank Jean and Yuni in reservations\n"

The main pool can be busy however there is an adults only separate spa pool which would benefit from more loungers. The main pool had plenty of loungers but little space so this needs to be reviewed to make the best of it. Unfortunately loungers are reserved by quite a few people and are not used for considerable amounts of time and the pool area would benefit from pool management. The hotel provides a comprehensive breakfast buffet which should cater for every need, however the dining room can be busy.

                "\nThis was the second time my wife and I stayed here. This time we brought my two teenage children and my parents. They made every attempt to cater for our requirements and were always willing to listen to their guests and were always looking for ways to improve their resort. As always on holidays nothing goes perfectly. We had some issues regarding the consistency of the housekeeping but as soon as we brought this to the attention of the guest relations staff this issue was rectified straight away. Like other resorts in the area the pool area is run by another organization and won’t allow outside food/drink at or around the pool even though you are staying at the resort. I found that this was one of the only rules that they enforced. As per normal there were other guests that thought they could do anything they wanted with no care for others (kids using the adults only pool, kids running around and bombing in pool which some parents were encouraging them, kids and adults screaming and yelling around the rooms, people taking others toast that they were cooking because they were too lazy to wait for their own, only to name a few examples). I wouldn’t normal blame the hotel for this but if they can enforce the rule about outside food/drink surely they could enforce every other rule that they have set. I also have to comment in regard to the many reviews stating that the hotel is full of Aussie bogans – I found that it was not Australians that were the problem, 100% of the New Zealand guests were totally out of control, a certain Asian nationality (exact nationality unknown) walked around the paths expecting others to move out of their way even if that meant you had to walk on the grass and I believe they were Americans based on the accent were rude and treated the staff like slaves. Don’t get me wrong, a lot of Australians do come to Bali and act like total “you know” and I am personally embarrassed by this behaviour but when you see 100% of certain other nationality’s acting like idiots and only a percentage from one nationality I find that the Aussie bogan statement is unwarranted. I have also read others saying things like the place is run down, outdated etc. Bali Garden Beach Resort wasn’t built last year and so things get old, things get worn out. Since our last visit there has been a lot of upgrades and I see they are still working on up keeping the resort. It may not be new and prestige but it has character and if you don't like this please go to one of the new concrete high rise hotels with no trees and everything smells like a hospital. Another thing I found since our last visit was that the staff have listened to comments that others and I made. One in particular was about the breakfast menu. Last time it was exactly the same the food everyday. This time the pre-cooked food menu was changed each day. The last comment I need to say is about the security. I work nightshift so I was up and about most mornings around 3am or 4am and found that there is always a security guard standing (not asleep in a security box) at every entrance of the resort no matter the time of day/night. Walking down the beach path early in the morning all the other resorts either just had a locked gate, had a security guard walking around the grounds, sitting or sleeping in booths or non at all. If you like a resort feeling, close to everything you need, lovely staff, excellent security and at a reasonable price then I would highly recommend Bali Garden Beach Resort. I know I will stay here again.\n"

The Boardwalk Cafe next to the pool is great - excellent value for money and everything is DELICIOUS! The grounds are beautiful, so serene. The staff at Bali Garden are great, always so friendly and helpful.\n"

It has a lovely beach resort ambience. Food and drinks reasonably priced. Different pools to choose from including spa. Lovely spa and massage place in the hotel and by the spa pool - again reasonably priced. The rooms are large with large beds and balcony. Staff are very helpful and friendly. It is surprisingly quiet and peaceful though right in the centre of Kuta. Adjacent to Discovery Mall and across the road from Waterbom Park - very convenient. Nice little lobby shop again reasonably priced. The only drawback is the beach not as nice as Sanur but from the frontage of the hitel there are comfortable spaces and lounges to look over the water and coastline. We will definitely be back with our family.\n"

There's no outlet for a dryer in the bathroom. The all room outlets are Indonesian style, so you need to bring an International adaptor from home.. Or ending up buying on the street.. I used them and lasted 4 days, so it was OK. Only issues was it costs around 50000Rp(12500 Rp for 1 US$ so 4US) but their asking price was 200000Rp, I just neglected so price was going down quickly. 60000-80000 is good for a tourist price.

The room was big (3 of us with 1 on a rollaway bed and the other 2 in single beds) the bathroom was spacious, we could fit 2 of us using the mirror at once. The pool isn't large but it's big enough for this busy resort. The staff at the pool bar are playful! The cocktails were delicious and the menu of good was delicious! One of the best nasi goreng i have had in bali! The staff at the front desk were incredibly helpful, we checked out but wanted to keep our luggage there due to a late flight, the staff allowed us to access our luggage with ease and also let us remain in the public areas for the day (pool and restaurant and lobby) and also offered us a room with showers to prepare for the flight home. It was a good experience staying here and I would definitely consider returning and suggesting it to others.\n"

Food at boardwalk restaurant still very nice however the floor and lounge chairs were always covered in leaves and nuts dropping from trees and were hardly ever swept up. The same goes for both pool areas and pool lounges always covered in leaves and berries and sometimes ants as well, very untidy looking at all times of the day. It seems as if they've spent a lot of money on new restaurants out the front and have let everything else slip. Wifi is not free in rooms and is very slow ,sometimes almost non existent. Room service is now served in takeaway boxes instead of on plates and the plastic cups are so flimsy you can hardly hold without spilling. overall I wouldnt stay here again and wouldn't recommend to anyone anymore, definitely much better hotels for the same price in the kuta area.

As with most Bali resorts, it offers free breakfast but this can work against travelers because it becomes easy for everyone to offer a substandard fare. For a big hotel, breakfast lacked variety - a little bit of Western, a little Asian but a poor range of fruits and other options. The hotel does have a great pool, and as other reviewers have commented excellent poolside service (swim up bar) but the surrounds were generally poorly cleaned overnight and the pool is badly lit at night. Internet coverage for an establishment offering free wifi is simply terrible, and purchasing internet does not make it any better.

Wouldn't recommend going in school holidays - as there will be alot of kids. There is an adults pool though - although we preferred to chill out the front by the beach. Wifi doesn't work too well and you have to buy hours for the room. But other than that, I would recommend.\n"

I dont have a single complaint about this hotel and I would definitely stay there again. It is located directly across from Bubba Gumps which made catching Taxi's home a breeze as everyone knows where that is. Waterbom Park is just across the road and the massive Discovery Shopping centre is just up the road. You can also head out the back of the hotel, past the pools and walk along the beach all the way into the heart of Kuta (Poppy's Lane, Hard Rock Cafe ect...) There is an excellent selection for breakfast and the restaurant sits above a massive koi pond looking out at the beautiful rainforrest like gardens. There is a spa in the hotel, we went there for massages daily. They were a little more expessive than the streets, but the spa is done lovely and you feel so relaxed just walking in. You get half an hour free wi-fi when checking in that you can use in the bar or pool area and you can purchase more ($10 p/hr). The website does mention a gym, but its more of an alcove outside with some dumbells in it and a row machine.\n"

Booking.com says the resort is wheelchair friendly however on arrival we found stairs leading to reception and no ramp. To access our room we had to go out of resort, down the side of the restaurant and in through the back of the kitchen. This was ok however still painful as we didn't get what it said. The internet is absolutely woeful. You are given one free hour on arrival and if you want internet in your room you have to pay 25000Rp for one hour. It is so slow that you waste nearly all your time waiting for download. You can go to the pool area and use the free wifi there but if there are many people hooked into it it is very very slow and frustrating. Breakfast was really good. Plenty to choose from, fresh and clean. Staff very friendly in the restaurant and reception however pool staff where quite slow and spent lots of time talking instead of taking orders around the pool. Access to the beach is great and it's not far to the shopping centre or any restaurants to eat at. Overall 7/10 but internet needs upgrading for me to return and they also need to read the special requests on their bookings.\n"

From temples and statues to ponds with Koi carp, little bridges, the swimming pools and eventually, the beach. Beautiful. The rooms are spacious and have balconies looking out onto the gardens. The air con works well, so much so, it's often better to turn it off for a while. The staff were brilliant and couldn't be more obliging. Breakfast was ok, but a little repetitive, although a wide choice of Eastern and European food, so you could chop and change. So is there a BUT? Unfortunately, yes and it is nothing to do with the hotel; it's the area. It is, quite honestly, seedy and devoted to extracting money from tourists at every opportunity. Fine for a night, or even two, but if you are over 30, that will be enough. That said, a great Indonesian restaurant next door bar open called Damar - great food, lovely staff!\n"

Comfortable lounges allow for sitting and watching the sunset and small native boats criss crossing the ocean with a cocktail and looking at the local hawkers and tourists walking on the boardwalk whilst young men paying soccer on the sandy shore.

They offer free wifi on the boardwalk & next door restaurants but it is so slow it's not even worth the fuss of trying to connect. Even when you pay the connection is bad and still can only be used in the lobby. I spent 2 days sick in bed so it would have been nice to be able to connect to wifi from my room and chat to family & friends back home. When first checking in we found the room wasn't very cool and figured the aircon was not working correctly.

                "\nI have rated this accommodation a 4 based on several different factors. The first is the obvious popularity of the Resort and the position in relation to activities and markets along with restaurants . The rooms are adequate if you are mostly in Bali to swim, shop and eat. They are lovely and clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. But my suggestion is to outlay just a little more and stay in one of the Villas. I stayed with a group of women in a three bedroom Villa and it was just perfect. Each room has it's own bathroom and the upstairs rooms also have a balcony facing the garden. The living dining area is very comfortable and each kitchen is well stocked if you did not want to head out for dinner. A microwave is situated on the lower floor along with the fridge and tea and coffee making facilities. The main pool is well designed and is back far enough from the ocean front to allow a little privacy. Along the beach front is where you will find the bars and restaurant which is an addition to the main breakfast area. The only disappointing thing is that this particular beach area is more rocky than nice sand. You are however in the best part of town for shopping. Here you can barter well and come out with some very well priced items unlike moving to the Seminyak district where prices escalate and the shop owners seem far less inclined to want to deal in the sport of price negotiations. Outside the Hotel is an excellent Mexican Restaurant where you can have Latin dance lessons in between courses\n"

It's a lot bigger and is directly across from waterbom park and has access to the beach. I liked the breakfast and the staff in breakfast shop where great. Pancakes are made fresh and lots of options for everyone, good egg station and Indonesia breakfast as well. Rooms are basic and clean I was in a deluxe room which was fine the air con was not the best and was blowing cool air not very cold at all. Pools are great and so is the boardwalk restaurant on the beach front. The only things I didn't like was the free WiFi it is so slow it's not worth having on. It's only available free at the pool near the boardwalk and it barely works, at the other pool you can forget it no chance of free WiFi. You can use in lobby but it does cost you per hour and it's not much better either it's too slow. While at the dynasty for a meal the WiFi was perfect and free everywhere so it can work in Bali. They need to upgrade and fix the WiFi issue. Otherwise a cheap and cheerful hotel in a great location.\n"

Met so many nice people and they made the trip much more enjoyable. Mainly Australians staying here. The rooms were a little disappointing sorry to say. The bottom sheets were extremely discoloured and stained top sheets not as bad but was a shock when we are used to white crisp sheets. The bathrooms could also so with a renovation. Toilet was leaking and so were taps. Being that we spent next to no time in the room it hasn't disheartened me from returning.

                "\nSpent a week in September 14 at the Bali Gardens. We LOVED it! Great staff, very friendly and helpful. Always smiling. Nice big, cool clean rooms. Beds slightly hard, but not a huge thing. Breakfast was probably one of the best hotel breakfasts I have experienced in Bali. Plenty of variety, and so much yummy food. My 10 yr old loved the pancakes, and had these every day. Bali Gardens has a fabulous swimming pool with a swim up bar, or a few bar tables in the pool if you prefer the company of your own group. Great food at the pool bar. We loved the Tapas menu. Right on the beach front, and boasting some gorgeous views. Also close to shopping and some great restaurants, but not in central Kuta, so we didn't experience the craziness of the Kuta night life. Waterbom park is STRAIGHT across the road for the kids.Rooms were quiet at night. Could hear some noise in the mornings with suitcases and people talking, but that is to be expected. On our day of checkout, the staff were fabulous, and allowed us to check out at 12.30pm (as our ride wasn't until then), at no extra charge. There was free wifi by the pool, or for a minimal fee ($2.50 AUD) you could purchase wifi in the rooms for an hr. Overall, we had a brilliant stay here. After pouring over numerous hotels prior to our trip, this was by far the best for location, price and hotel facilities. Will definitely stay here again.\n"

As other reviews already mention, very close to everything, therefore YES you will get lots of families staying there, therefore lots of noise. But I didn't have a negative experience with this in general, and it's not really the resorts fault... When we did have issues with noise we asked a lovely man at reception if we could possibly change rooms so I could get some decent sleep (our room was right near an elevator and stair hall and other guests would very rudely clunk loudly up and down the stairs at all hours and yell, laugh and talk loudly, so rude!)

Yes, the Boardwalk Restaurant had free WiFi, but this internet was even slower then the in room WiFi, and took 5 minutes to send 1 message on FB Messenger. I've been to Bali and Thailand, and all resorts I have stayed in have had free and fast WiFi. The resort needs to seriously address this.

There is no road separating the resort from the beach contrary to a lot of resorts further north which are separated from the beach by the very busy Jalan Pantai Kuta. Moreover the resort stretches more towards the sea than the others. Therefore you get a unique sideways view towards the whole Kuta beach both from the Boardwalk beachfront restaurant and the infinity pool. A location so close to the beach is quite unique.",

Starting from Jalan Arjuna where the Double Six beach is located, there are several water streams that go into the sea and cross the beach. From the stench, it is obvious that this is untreated waste water that must one of the pollution sources of Kuta beach. I was relieved to stay at the Bali Garden because it is quite far further south of these streams. It completely deterred me from staying in more luxurious hotels like the Oberoi or the Legian. Overall I have the feeling Seminyak is more directed by this water pollution.",

Two days later the waves where less powerful and I happily body-boarded.",
                "We tried the beachfront restaurant , Boardwalk, several times. We tasted the local dishes and found them quite good. Moreover it's not too expensive. What we didn't appreciate was the limited choice for breakfast buffet. Except for fried rice and fried noodles there is hardly anything Indonesian or even Asian about this breakfast buffet. Why take an intercontinental flight to Bali just to eat fried bacon and eggs for breakfast?",

Unfortunately this means that from the balcony you see the back of the mall and enjoy the noise of what are probably the air conditioning units. Morever this room is also close to the main road so you also get some noise from there. This is to be expected from any hotel room in the Kuta area. What I really didn't like was the cleanliness of the floor. The hotel uses big white tiles. After walking on them for a couple of steps your feet blacken. We asked for floor cleaning but I think the result was mere redistribution of the dirt. We ended up moping ourselves the floor with a bath towel. Bring your own slippers because at this price range it's not supplied by the hotel. Overall the furniture in the room is dated and there aren't much amenities. Not even something to put the hotel soap into.",

From the time we arrived until our sad departure it was a very memorable experience. The staff were extremely friendly and courteous, spoke very good English and seem to want to make our stay most memorable. The restaurants on site were very good and quite cheap compared to other resorts. The layout of the resort was fantastic. full of gardens, ponds, 3 pools and a beautiful Boardwalk area was fantastic. Overlooking the beautiful beach you could either have a swim, sit back on a lounge and relax or sit at one of the bars 20m from the beach and just look at the most beautiful views. By far this is one of the best located resorts that provides everything from great staff, great views, great location and great eating areas from Mexican, to Italian and everything in-between. If you want a great holiday in the heart of activity with spectacular views that give you the sense of a tropical paradise this is the place to stay. Like any holiday, if you go with the mind set of having a good time you will here. The Balinese people are lovely people and welcome you with open arms. This resort is only a 3 min walk to a large shopping centre that has everything and is surrounded by all the market shopping you could want within walking distance. Out the front is a paved pathway separating the resort from the beach that goes for 2-3 klm. Great walk, for some exercise along the beach. We met a lot of wonderful people from all over the world who all seemed to be having a wonderful time. Some people we met, it was there 10 and 15 visit to Bali Gardens. That says it all. Thankyou Bali Gardens for such a great experience and memorable holiday. Can't wait to come back next year and looking forward to catching up with some of the very happy and funny staff.\n"

I can't even explain how bad the stench was outside of our front door. Below us the rubbish from the Discovery shopping centre.. We had towels stuffed under the door to stop the smell coming through. We burnt incense sticks constantly to help the smell.

We ended up arguing with staff and even on the way to the airport the reception rang again saying we had to pay the bill. We didn't! We have asked for an explanation from management but haven't heard back as yet. I guess that topped off our holiday with a sour taste. We are returning to bali next year but have started to look at other hotels.

It’s an older, more traditional hotel with all of the rooms/villas spread through the lovely gardens and not far from the beach. Great pool area overlooking beach. Very welcoming staff. Relaxing and peaceful.",

Beware, the complimentary sunscreen (SPF30) does not work, we both burned when using it (and we were reapplying regularly, sitting in the shade etc – it was not through our own incompetence!) The service in parts of the hotel is pretty sub-par (for a hotel of this star rating) – for example at breakfast it was difficult to get anyone’s attention after making your initial order; the swimming pool staff pretty much forgot everything I asked for and needed to be reminded; slow bar service. Wifi connectivity is also very unreliable and quite slow in the public areas.\n"

My only regret is that the staff are required by local law to retire at age 55, so we keep losing old friends. When Made Ardinata retires next year, that will probably be my signal that I should retire from travel as well. As a frequent international travellor, this Hotel ticks every box for wonderful service and ambience. I make special mention here of Arie in reservations, Made and Wayan at breakfast and Sumantra at the pool. All old friends who we really look forward to seeing again and again. These are just a few of the friendly faces that we are really looking forward to seeing shortly.\n"

With beautiful grounds and villas, it is an authentic and traditional styled Balinese resort, and for sure it is meeting or exciding Oberoi standards.

Couple of tips - this is not a \"party\" place, expect peace and tranquility. There were some comments about food a drinks' prices. Well, it is Oberoi and it is a 5* resort...

From the moment you arrive you are so well looked after. We have been lucky enough to have stayed in a few 5* hotels over the years and I can honestly say that the atmosphere and quality of service would be hard to beat. We enjoyed our standard garden room which was very luxurious. The pool area was beautiful and right next to the beach. Every little detail was thought of as you would expect. Little hamper style baskets at your loungers for your stuff. Water,cooling spray and scented towels waiting for you. Fruit and ice cream arrived in the afternoon.....just perfect!

The pool was clean but had the same depth throughout. There was a sala at an elevated height next to the pool where you could sit an enjoy white foamy waves lashing upon the smooth beach while sipping at a lemon grass drink. The bed was not too soft and not to hard and the housekeeping was excellent. The hotel is situated at the heart of Seminyak and there are several eateries / bars just a few steps away from the hotel.

After almost 10 days of resort-based r&r at our previous stops, we were more than happy to get out each day and venture \"off campus\" to various local warungs for cheap, yummy Indonesian food (especially recommend Eny and Kolega) as well as coffee shops and bars that could just as well flourish in our hometown of Dumbo, Brooklyn.

And each evening at four pm, we were sure to catch the daily tea service at the hotel's scenic amphitheater, where we watched local children perform traditional Balinese dances and music.

However if you are looking for 'almost' private setting, personalized service, local flavor and pure luxury, look no further. We spent 6 nights (wife, kid and me) in June 2015. It is a massive beachfront property - very few rooms (that is the point - they could easily stuff 2-3x more rooms but that would kill the charm), well manicured lawns, smallish pool, fewer restaurants (but excellent food). You almost feel like you could be relaxing in a large private estate (except when you venture out to poolside or restaurant where you get to see more people). Beach is not the cleanest (but that comes with staying in Seminyak). Bed takes some getting used to. There is only 1 pool which is 5 ft deep, so most kids would need to wear floaters to enjoy the pool. Highly recommended for families and couples. Ensure you get a breakfast included package as food is a bit on the expensive side (especially for breakfast).\n"

I have however stayed in many luxury hotels inlcuding in South and Southeast Asia vastly better and cheaper that this one. The Oberoi enjoys a great setting on the beach, even though by Australian standards it is a most uninviting beach, and has lovely grounds. It is the oldest hotel in Seminyak and is regarded as \"old Bali\". It has a reputation for luxury that is however undeserved. For the equivalent of almost $AUD 700 per night you need to get more than a reputation and friendly service, of which there is an abundance. Ceiling fans, insect screens and above most else, a spectacular breakfast, shoud be provided. The pool is relativley small by modern hotel standards. Breakfast is served outdoors and slowly. One morning I believed it was going to rain but the staff said no. Shortly after that it poured and the wet patrons had to be moved under cover and breakfast re- organised. It was badly done and suggests a lack of attention to detail and good systems. The hotel car system works well but the drivers' local knowledge was lacking and some guests I knew were lost. I was stranded by a driver on one occasion. Some rooms lacked privacy and a nice outlook. The wi-fi was excellent . Overall a pleasant hotel with a nice atmosphere but not good value in my book.\n"

We were in a villa this year, and really liked the privacy of the walled courtyard.

                "\nThis was the 3rd time we stayed at the Oberoi. Each visit was in April for our wedding anniversary. This was our 10th anniversary and it seemed like a great idea to come back to Bali. We wouldn't consider any other hotel in Bali (at least near the populated areas like Seminyak). We've seen a lot from the beach, and the Oberoi is in a different class.",
                "Not much has changed at the Oberoi since we were there 4 or 5 years ago. But, a lot has changed in the Seminyak area. For this review I will focus on what has changed and what hasn't. Hopefully that will be helpful for new and returning visitors to Bali.",
                "Before I get into the review, want to note that - for the first time - I'm not sure I want to go back to Bali again. As you will read, there are so many magical things about Bali and the Oberoi. But, there are a couple of things - such as the sewer smell on the grounds of the hotel and the garbage on the beach - that weren't there before, and aren't at some of the alternative destinations we like to go. I didn't like the answer I got about the sewer smell (see the 'What has changed?' section below) from the hotel staff, and that's too bad because you can't 'cover up' or ignore issues like strong smells and expect guests to simply ignore the smells and keep coming back. I would have appreciated a more direct answer, that felt more honest, versus the one I got which was (in my opinion) somewhat evasive.",
                "What hasn't changed:",
                "- The Oberoi's staff is still amazingly attentive, sincere, friendly, and thoroughly committed to making your visit as great as it can be. It's hard to imagine what a high level of service this is until you experience it. There isn't a single hint that anyone there is less than 100% focused on you, and that they want to be there and are happy in their jobs.",
                "- Enrique (the chef) is still serving astoundingly good food - from the dining room to the pool side. World class. And he is happy to work with you to create special meals. We had the 'Romantic Dinner' on the beach for our actual anniversary (they set up a table, ringed with candles in the sand) and it was incredible.",
                "- The staff that takes care of your room must be trained as mind readers because they do things before you ask them, or would never think to ask them. I'll never forget coming back to the room after our first day at the pool and every power cord had been rolled up and secured with a strip of Velcro. Another example is when we took a bath before dinner and used the entire jar of bath salts. After dinner, of course, the jar was full again. The funniest thing that happened in the room was when we called room service for a bucket of ice. 5 minutes later they were at the room. As they handed us the bucket, they asked if they could have the other one back. We looked in the bar and there was already a bucket full of ice there. We checked every day after that and it was clear they were filling that bucket up with fresh ice every day.",
                "- The pool and beach are amazing. Get to the pool early and reserve your favorite loungers. The staff will set them up for you. Watch out for the ocean waves. They are bigger than you think.",
                "- There are still a lot of great restaurants in the area (easily reachable by walking) if you want to save some money or get something simpler. Our favorite by far is the Ku De Ta right next to the Oberoi to the North West on the beach. The drinks are amazing, as is the food. Try the pitcher of Pink Sangria. We begged for the recipe and have been making it at home since we got back.",
                "- The cost of hiring a car, driver, and guide is still amazingly low. About $100 USD per day. They have prearranged tours our will take you wherever you want to go. The only caveat is that the prearranged tours always seem stop at places that demonstrate crafts like woodworking on the face of things, but are really about selling their products to you. It's pretty clear that there is a relationship between these places and the Oberoi and it gets a little tedious as the shops don't really want to let you leave easily and your driver sometimes becomes a little hard to find. Also, the restaurants where they stop for lunch tend to be OK, but very expensive. This time we told the driver to not go anywhere that would try to sell us things, and we picked our own lunch spot.",
                "- The Balinese countryside is still unchanged and amazing. Get out into the country! Experience the people! We haven't found a place yet that isn't colorful and full of great people. ",
                "- The Oberoi still brings in craftsmen and dance/music groups. If you have never seen Balinese dance or heard the Gamelan music, you can't imagine what it's like!",
                "What has changed:",
                "- It pains me to write this, but we were there for about 10 days and there was a prominent sewer smell on the hotel's property for most of them. It came and went with the direction of the wind, but was clearly present at some point of every day. It's hard to sit on a lounger overlooking the Indian Ocean and have a stench overtake you. I wrote an e-mail to the executive management and let them know that the smell was really detracting from our stay. The response was basically that there are rivers that flow past both sides of the property and into the ocean, and these rivers have 'natural' organisms that cause the smell and are unavoidable. In find this explanation hard to believe for several reasons: (1) there was no smell during our prior two visits - which were at the same time of year (2) it's a sad fact that plumbing isn't widespread in Bali's countryside and sewage does end up in the rivers and flows to the ocean, especially when it rains during the day, so I don't think the smells were really 'natural' and (3) the hotel was working on some kind of sewer system upgrade when we were there - coincidence? Hard to say. But hard to rule out. The bottom line is that we love Bali and the Oberoi, but the smell isn't something we can ignore, and I don't think we will go back to Bali and the Oberoi until we can verify that the smell is gone. ",
                "This is also my only real complaint about the management staff at the hotel. They are truly amazing people, but I don't feel like I got a satisfactory answer about the smell. I understand why they wouldn't want to talk much about such a thing, but they need to acknowledge the issue, and they have to figure out a way to deal with it regardless of the source.",
                "- The beaches had far more trash on them than either my wife or I could remember from prior visits. As the tides would come in and out, lines of all sorts of trash would be left on the beach. This wasn't an issue in front of any of the major hotels as they clearly had people raking the beach at the right times. The Oberoi's beach was (of course) spotless. But, if you walk a mile on the beach, you will experience trash for at least 1/2 of your walk. Some days are worse than others, but there is always trash at the high water mark. Given the low cost of labor in Bali, the government would be doing a big thing to protect the tourism industry if it simply paid some people to rake the beaches in their entirety around the main tourist centers.",
                "- Seminyak (and surrounding areas like Legian) have become far busier. It looks like a number of new hotels have been built and this has caused the areas to become more crowded with people. That said, more people means more shops and restaurants - and we walked into these parts of the area almost daily (where we didn't do that in the past - there wasn't much that was interesting close by).",
                "- A side effect of the growth in the area is that the Oberoi felt much more like a walled oasis in a busy place than in the past, where the Oberoi felt like a great hotel on a beach amongst other hotels on the beach. My wife and I both noted that the Oberoi was like a paradise, but that it was hard to forget that when you walked out of the front gate, you were in a busy Indonesian city.",

In all three cases the experience was superb. Several things stood out at Oberoi that deserve mentioning. First, the staff was amazing. As in all of Bali, the commitment to excellence and hospitality in all the people we met was so gracious. The Balinese are inherently the most peaceful and loving people we have met. The Oberoi has done a superb job in taking this inherent grace of the Balinese to a more refined level. It's obvious that the staff training by the company is of the utmost quality. The staff make absolutely certain that we who stay there are completely cared for. From the meal staff, to the pool and beach staff and to those who kept our room and did out laundry, everyone there was completely of service. Finally, to the beauty of the hotel itself - it is such a respite from the chaos surrounding it. We went out only once and felt assaulted by the town, quickly retreating back to the absolute beauty and tranquility of the hotel grounds! ",

The drive from the aeroport to the hotel at 2 am did little to quell my fears. But as soon as we entered the grounds of the Oberoi I knew that there was at least one piece of Bali that retained the old magic. After a journey of thirty some odd hours, the lanai was a delightful sight, especially the marble bath with sunken tub and secret garden. The large and extremely comfortable bed did not disappoint either. The accommodations are one-story bungalows with front porches scattered around beautifully landscaped grounds, with separate thatched pavilions for the bar, the restaurant and the reception area. There is a small outdoor amphitheatre for afternoon performances during tea time as well as a couple of evening dance performances during the week. The swimming pool overlooking the beach has a very attentive staff tending to your every need. Swimming in the sea is a bit of a challenge, since the undertow is frequently very strong with a fierce rip tide.",

If you're looking for a quiet retreat while still being close enough to all the action, Oberoi is the place for you. The location can't be beat, you are walking distance from a handful of amazing restaurants, cafes, and shops in Seminyak. Enter the resort, and you'll feel like you're off on your own little island. Each suite at the Oberoi is its own lanai, with a private seating area. I was surprised as I had expected a more modern hotel building. It was a nice surprise and we really enjoyed walking through the grassy area and by the pool to get to our lanai at the end of each day, but I realize this is probably not for everyone. If you're looking for a more modern and practical accommodation, there are other hotels in the area that would suit your needs better. The room is spacious and thoughtfully appointed, with a timeless elegance feel about it. The staff are amazing, as other reviewers have pointed out. They are some of the most genuinely hospitable and helpful people I've ever met on all my travels, and they are very good at what they do. We always came back to a cozy, clean room, with our clothes neatly folded, fresh local fruits on the table, 4 new bottles of filtered water, the best coffee & tea supplies, and a sheet outlining free activities that the hotel offers the following day.

If you choose to go to Seminyak beach, there's a private entrance from the Oberoi and you can rent boogie board for free from the lifeguard. If you're a confident swimmer, Seminyak beach has some great waves for body boarding at times. The beach is a bit dirty with pieces of trash floating around in the water, but they do a good job of keeping the shore clean. The gift shop at the Oberoi has a great variety of products that I was actually interested in, and I thought the pricepoint, while on the expensive side, was reasonable. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the restaurant. We went to the restaurant for breakfast twice and both times, I thought the food was mediocre and definitely didn't warrant the super steep price.

The last day while my husband explored more of the island, I stayed at the hotel. I was only too happy to visit their boutique and pick up a book, get an excellent massage from their spa, enjoy meals at their restaurants, completely relax, and get ready for my return to everyday life at home. This is a wonderful place to stay!\n"

We originally had a garden view villa but upon arrival we decided to splurge a little and upgrade our room to the ocean view villa with private pool.... I must say it was the best decision! Our villa was absolutely beautiful, the bed was super comfortable (the pillows - amazing), the room was clean and there was plenty of space for the both of us. The bathroom was very nice with the separate vanities & sinks. The pool area was so nice, we used the private pool every day and it's cleaned every morning by the hotel staff. The staff is so friendly and will do whatever you need to make your stay the best it possibly can. The hotel grounds are absolutely breathtaking, there are mature trees, flowers and little ponds all around. The location of the hotel is also great, you can walk to shopping and many restaurants that are in the area. A cab ride to restaurants is quick as well... overall the location can't be beat. The security at the hotel is also a positive, we felt safe the whole time which is something to be said. I highly recommend this hotel!!! The only negative that I can say which isn't the hotel's fault is we went during the rainy season - the hotel is just in a weird spot where the waves hit the beach in the right spot and trash from other island is deposited on the beach in front of the Oberoi. It's sad really to see that much waste and trash in our oceans. The Oberoi has staff that work 8 hours a day to clean up the trash but it's impossible to get it all. If you walk to the left or right down the beach there is no trash. I feel badly for The Oberoi that they have to deal with it. If you are going during the rainy season just be aware that you most likely won't be swimming in the ocean in front of The Oberoi - the waves are crazy so if you surf then you're good to go. We would definitely return to The Oberoi, Bali again.\n"

So, after a few days of staying there and if you get tired of watching the same performance over and over again, you can just have a cup of tea and sit on a bench, soaking up the incredible view with the ocean breeze gently stroking your face.

I stayed in a Luxury Lanai with my 13 year old son (who spent far too long in the sunken bath....) and our experience from arrival to departure was amazing. The rooms, the amenities and the food were exceptional and the service is flawless - prompt and discreet and nothing was too much trouble. The beach is pretty much uninhabitable in the wet season as off-shore storms bring in a lot of debris and shopping in Seminyak is a hectic as anywhere in Bali, with not as many quality bargains as there used to be, but the hotel offers a shuttle service that can get you within walking distance to Legian for some great boutiques, beautiful woodwork and affordable knick-knacks or you can use the hotel taxi service to venture further afar. I cannot rate this hotel high enough to reflect the experience we had.\n"

                "\nThe Oberoi property was my favorite part of Bali. From the moment you arrive, the service is exceptional. My villa was very cute, seemingly in local style but with all the modern amenities you would expect. The grounds are kept spotless, gorgeous flowering plants and trees everywhere. The swimming pool area is amazing, looking out to the sea, there is also a small stretch of private sand used only by guests of the Oberoi. As soon as you arrive to the pool area or the sand area, two staff will greet you with a sun umbrella, bottle of water, cold towel, and whatever else you may want to order (those sun umbrellas are no joke in Bali). The pool closed at 19:00 every night, which seemed a little strange to me, since it was definitely still warm enough to swim, but I talked to a local who mentioned this is not uncommon for Bali. Here I have to write about the above and beyond service I received. From Bali, I travelled to Bangkok, where I realized I left my entire toiletries bag in my room at the Oberoi. Normally, I would simply replace everything, but I had actually purchased some really expensive Kiehl's products a few weeks prior in Singapore. I emailed Oberoi, who confirmed the bag was left in the room, and THEY SENT THE BAG TO ME IN BANGKOK. All of this was done at no charge to me, even though it was clearly my mistake. A huge thank you to the staff at Oberoi, probably the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. If you're going to Bali, and wondering if you should spend the extra money to stay here, my answer is a resounding yes.\n"

From the moment we are met inside immigrant at the airport by resort staff, the level of service was as fine if not better than I have experienced at five star properties worldwide. We had reserved a garden villa but at check-in were informed that we had been upgraded to a pool villa at no extra cost, a delightful and very appreciated surprise. ",
                "This is a very large resort, but given the extensive, beautifully manicured grounds, as well as the spacing between villas, never feels crowded. Our own walled villa included beautiful gardens, multiple koi ponds (included a glass walled one next to the marble bath), and a beautiful infinity edge pool large enough for mini-lap swimming. ",
                "The Oberoi is an old resort, having been one of the first five star properties in Seminyak built during the '70s. As such, it retains much of the charm and ambiance of pre-mega resort Bali, numerous Hindu iconic pieces and other art dot the landscape, both in the private villas and in the public spaces. On the downside, the gym is rather limited and the public pool is a bit old fashioned. ",
                "The Oberoi is not cheap, and the restaurants and bars tend to be much more expensive than comparable establishments in Seminyak. But overall, this is a property that provides a level of service and comfort that is rare these days.",
                "Now, this having been our first visit to Bali, I would be somewhat amiss if I did not say a few words about Seminyak. Overall, we found the Seminyak experience lacking in several details. First of all, Seminyak is not an Indonesian city, but an extension of Australia. In short, tourist central, with terrible traffic and crowded restaurants. Step outside the Oberoi resort and one is immediately assaulted by heavy traffic, stagnant pools of water, narrow crowded sidewalks that not even the cars and motor bikes respect. There is a pervasive smell of sewer gas from crowded block to crowded block. Worst of all, the Bali beaches are by far the very worst I have seen anywhere else in the world. The sand is course and dirty brown. Up and down the beach, as far as the eye can see, are piles and piles of debris, mostly driftwood, but man made debris as well. The overall impression is one of major logging operations in progress. To see the real Bali, one is advised to get out of Seminyak as quickly as possible.\n"

To be fair, the way they handled the incidence was fine, but it's just such a disappionting ending of our vacation.\n"

                "\nIt has to be said that this a classic Balinese hotel at it'd finest, something from heyday of Balinese resorts, sadly of which there are few these days. The new concrete monstrosities are far cry from the old world charm of Bali, I find it sad they when you walk along Seminyak/Legian beach, it is tower after tower of modernism and progress..... And then you see the Oberoi, tucked into its surroundings, unobtrusive, it blends in with nature rather than fighting it, very little, besides the gardens, can be seen from the beach, it lets nature do the talking. Built in 1978, I have been informed very little has been done to the hotel apart from the internals, it was perfect when it was built and it is still perfect! The long driveway whisks you away from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak into a serene landscape far removed, it's almost as if you stepped into another Bali, peaceful and quiet, relaxed, beautiful without over the top opulence. The staff are incredible, they cannot do enough for you, they are attentive without being overbearing. ",
                "The rooms are beautiful, the king sized bed completed with incredibly comfortable Manchester and your choice of pillow from the 'menu' will ensure a relaxing night sleep. The marble lined bathrooms complete with double vanity are spacious and the immense bath completed with various salts and oils are great after a hard day pounding the pavement. ",
                "The grounds are green and spacious, the accommodations aren’t crammed in, and you get a great sense of space. If I had to name a complaint, the pool was a bit too warm for my taste, I guess because it sits in the blazing sun all day, in November it wasn't as refreshing as I hoped and the Gym was a little sparse. The service pool side was lovely, at 12pm fruit skewers are brought around and at 2pm, a sorbet. At 4-5 they have high tea with a Balinese dance performance. For me this hotel is all about the little things, sometimes they are not necessarily obvious but everything just works and works well. Wireless internet is everywhere and it's fast! The staff know where you are when friends come to visit they dropped them at our room in a golf cart! The personalised daily fruit platters, the setting up of day beds, it all just works perfectly.",
                "Our flight to Bali was cancelled and we arrived a day late, meaning we would forfeit our first night here, we were extremely sad about this, but they added the night to the end of our stay, at no cost!!! Unfortunately with other accommodation booked and paid for we couldn't take them up on this lovely offer. My only complaint was that it would have been nice if they had informed us of this when we arrived, we may have been able to make alternative arrangements. Again a minor complaint in their flawless service.\n"

We we given a room that was being held for a late arriving guest so we were able to keep the room until 5 pm. This was a great bonus as we had a late flight to Singapore. Unfortunately the room had no view which was probably the result of our choice for the lowest room category. Additionally we could hear the people in the adjoining room which seemed odd for a luxury property. Our room was nice but really nothing special. Other than that glitch the hotel was very pleasant with great staff at both the pool and restaurant. The whole property was ok but not extraordinary.\n"

John Halpin (General Manager) and his amazing Team offer a warm and genuine welcome and perfect service throughout your stay. We had the most beautiful Beach Villa. Traditional in design, with the most amazing four poster bed. We had our own private courtyard, with an outdoor dining bale and sun loungers next to a tranquil fish pond. The room was equipped to the highest standards, with an oversized bathroom, with a beautiful sunken bath (overlooking the courtyard), separate sink areas (I wish more hotels would do this) and a short hop onto the beach (where you enjoy stunning sunsets). Service levels are so high, that you truly feel pampered throughout the day. There is a beautiful resort pool. The Bar Staff are super friendly and they have a lovely outdoor restaurant, which overlooks a performance area, where traditional dances take place on selected nights of the week. The resort also showcases local talent, with gamelan musicians and artists, as well as a great shop (with interesting artefacts at quite reasonable prices). The Oberoi showcases traditional Bali perfectly, but you are only a short hop away from the great shopping, restaurants and nightlife that the island is famous for. The hotel can arrange \"Community Cars\", which are a great way to support the local community and a very cost effective way to get around. The Oberoi is a rare treat in a sea of luxury resorts.\n"

It wasn't the prettiest ocean water in Bali, it looked more like water from home in California. Sandy beach, not very good waves at all. But, that didn't matter! We had already surfed and explored and hoped to do a few more things while we stayed at the Oberoi. But, we loved it so much we stuck around at the hotel and enjoyed every minute of it relaxing, swimming, walking around the hotel, and enjoying all it had to offer. It was so gorgeous! We got a private villa with our own pool that was incredible to say the least. The staff was so friendly. We recieved a note from the manager wishing us a wonderful honeymoon and we even got a cake and fresh fruit in our room. Maid service arrived twice a day! On our first night after an unforgettable couples massage and dinner, we came back to candles lit in the bathroom and Plumeria's in the bathtub! We loved the room service, the bar, and the food. And it was so easy to walk to other resturaunts and shops. The bed was huge an so comfortable! We even had staff cleaning our pool and replacing linens on our chairs daily. Lastly, we wanted to store our surfboards when we visited Japan but didn't speak fluent Japanese. The concierge called all sorts of numbers and finally was able to contact someone and speak fluent Japanese and give us the information we needed! They went above and beyond.

                "Now I wouldn't normally make a big issue of this, and have stayed in many expensive hotels around the world where I am happy to pay £10 for a beer (Monaco!) but it has to be priced in the same ball park as options outside. We booked through Expedia and weren't sure if breakfast was included, it turned out not to be, but not before we had spent almost £50 on a breakfast. The next day we found the highly rated sisterfields (top 5 on ta) a 10 minute walk away, and literally had more or less the same breakfast, of equal if not better quality, for 75% less - the hotel was literally 4x the price. We also dined at la luciolla the next day for the same price as the hotel breakfast!! Hotels will always have a premium but this really felt like profiteering - breakfast was the worst offender (as other reviewers have mentioned) but the pool menu and drinks were also very highly priced even in hotel terms. ",
                "My personal view is that the hotel is being quite cynical in trying to monetise those who book through third party websites to get cheaper prices, by making breakfast extremely expensive and not included in the discount rates. The hotel have previously responded to comments like this by saying the breakfast is priced in line with alternatives (which I think is a bit unfair), and that if you want breakfast included pay for a higher room rate - I would say find the cheapest room you can, and eat and drink everything else 10 minutes away in seminyak, there are many great alternatives to give you more variety, and you will save money. The food is good in the hotel, but I don't think it's the best in bali - we certainly had better breakfast in ubud at komaneka.\n"

So upon arrival, we were a bit taken aback that development seems to have spread everywhere with hustle and bustle everywhere and horrendous traffic. That all ended as soon as we arrived at the gate of the Oberoi Bali. Suddenly we were on an island with just a few of our fellow guests, and the wonderful hotel staff around. Even the beach fronting the hotel seemed more deserted. One of our suitcases haden't made ir to Bali so we were provided with an emergency kit to use until it arrived. We chose to stay in a villa facing the beach, and again, it seemed as if we were in our own little world. It's difficult to find a nit to pick. The staff were amazing at every level from the front of the house to the grounds keepers. The food and drink was outstanding as were the folks who served it. We were especially impressed with the hotel's sea turtle conservation program. After they are laid, the eggs are protected until they hatch, the the young are held in a tank until they are ready to return to the sea, then finally they are released without the dangerous trip across the beach. We can't wait to return.\n"

                "\nWe arrived at the Oberoi on Saturday after booking a room only special on their website for 9 nights. I was going to wait until I left, but having reread many of the recent reviews, I thought I'd add mine now as first impressions often make/break an experience. My husband and I just rediscovered Bali 2 years ago after travelling to the States and Europe many times. We love the \"grunginess\" mixed with great accomodation and even better restaurants as well as the gorgeous people! We've stayed in 5*villas and the Mulia (soulless) so far and this is by far the most beautiful. The grounds are simple, elegant and immaculate. You feel like you're in Bali rather than some overcrowded, super-modern hotel that could be anywhere in the world. Of course this has its pro's and con's like most things do. ",
                "CONS - The villas and lanai's are all single level and dotted in groups throughout the grounds straddling a wide stretch of beach which is nice. Interestingly there are almost no photos of the standard rooms, either with ocean view or without it, on their website. This is for a reason! They are simple in the extreme. I am assuming that I have their most basic room (hopefully!) as I purchased a special deal - still US$300 plus 21% tax room only. It's small and uninspiring. The whole space, inc bath and terrace may be 60sqm but the room is lucky to be 20-25msq. The shower is over the dated sunken bath which looks over a small walled garden. There could have been a nice second open air shower here which is a missed opportunity to ramp it up. Everything is however spotless, although the shower head leaks like a sieve which someone else commented on! To make it even better, the door only shuts from the inside as the handles are fixed and therefore light from he outside garden streams in on a morning through the opening. There is nothing glamorous or 5* about the space at all. Basic cane sofa and chair are more 3* than 5, and not one piece of artwork on the bare white wall in the room . The ceiling doesn't rake up either as shown in photos but is a flat rattan one. No cushions on the bed, no colour even subtle except for the bed head, which is a silk screen print. Tiny minibar, and plunger coffee only. Surely with only 78 rooms you could have a Nespresso these days? The bed is also like a rock and I like a firmer mattress! There are two chairs with bottle green seats and a teak table on the terrace when there could have been two sun beds for some privacy if you didn't feel like lounging around the pool. I don't hate it but iim just disappointed. I'd expected so much more from an Oberoi. Just altogether VERY underwhelming. ",
                "Also because it's a relatively small hotel, which I like, there are a lot less facilities than at the larger properties in Nusa Dua or at the W. This is not a kid friendly hotel as their are no organised activities and only one smallish rectangular pool. This does however make it great for couples of all ages.",
                "The food and drinks are Australian prices which I object to when the staff are paid Bali wages, as at the Mulia (5* too) all the food was very reasonable and the choice of restaurant fantastic. Here there are only two and the food so far is nice, but not fantastic. Consequently they are empty as in Seminyak you are spoilt for choice.",
                "PROS - lovely staff, gorgeous grounds, best spot on the beach half way to everything in Seiminyak and Kerebokan. ",
                "Spa is small but looks nice - am going tomorrow. Prices seem reasonable for 5* property.",
                "So wanted to love it all! Don't think I'd return until rooms , whilst they can't get bigger, gets total overhaul. Just a feeling the hotel is resting on its name. These days everyone everywhere in any business has to keep up and not get complacent. The competition here is hot and getting hotter!\n"

                "\nMy husband and I stayed here for ten nights in August for our honeymoon, staying in a villa with a garden and a pool. It's possible the fact that it was my honeymoon made me a little bit biased, but I'd definitely say it's the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in, and I've visited several five star hotels before. ",
                "On arrival at Dempasar airport, I was exhausted after 27 hours in transit and a very full-blown wedding two days previously. The moment we were met by the hotel's air-conditioned car and given water and towels to wash our face, I started to relax. ",
                "On arrival at the hotel, I was absolutely blown away by how beautiful it was. It reminded me of a palace or a temple, all ponds and walkways and open spaces - a far cry from a lot of soulless expensive resorts. We were seated in the outdoor reception area and given a neck garland and a welcome cocktail while we checked in, which made something that can sometimes be a chore feel like the start of a holiday. ",
                "Our room was amazing. There was an absolutely huge four-poster bed - I think it could have slept about six people - a front garden, a back garden and a mini garden by the bathroom, and statues and fish ponds everywhere. The bathroom had a powerful shower and a huge bath that was clearly designed for sharing! Most impressively, there was a more or less full-length pool, not the sort of half-hearted affair you can sometimes get with pool villas. There was also a lovely veranda area that was perfect for secluded dinner and drinks a deux. ",
                "The villa was completely secluded, with high walls and a lockable gate to separate it from the rest of the hotel - perfect if you want a bit of privacy and peace and quiet. As it was our honeymoon, we spent a lot of time enjoying this seclusion - sunbathing by and swimming in our pool, then ordering room service food and drink to enjoy on the veranda. Room service was no more expensive than eating in the hotel restaurant, and the staff were happy to set our table up with tableclothes and candles and things. I’d highly recommend going for one of the pool villas if you can, but the main pool area was lovely too. ",
                "One thing I hate is when you've paid a lot for a nice hotel, and then it tries to rip you off on little things, making you feel like a cash cow rather than a guest. While the Oberoi is by no means an all-inclusive hotel, I really appreciated the way lots of little free treats were provided, like ice-cream by the pool or afternoon tea or a \"meet the manager\" cocktail evening. Other little touches included suncream and water being put out for us on our sunloungers each morning and a bowl of fresh fruit being bought to the room each day. Everything was beautifully presented and all staff, from the manager to the concierges to the cleaners just couldn't do enough to help. On arrival, we found our bed covered in flowers and a cake, card and bear waiting for us.",
                " ",
                "We were definitely there for a relaxing, coupley holiday rather than a cultural tour, but it would be a shame to have come to somewhere with as much history and tradition as Bali and not seen some of it. I therefore liked the way that the hotel brought culture to you. Every afternoon, there was afternoon tea and a demonstration of an aspect of Balinese culture in the outdoor ampitheatre - dancing, the making of offerings, music etc. You could just wander straight from the pool or the beach and soak this up. More formally, on two evenings there were organised shows in the ampitheatre. We made it to one of them - a performance of the Ramyana - and enjoyed both watching the performance and eating the Indonesian all you can eat feast that accompanied it! ",
                "More adventurously, the hotel did offer individual tours. We took part in one of these, which involved seeing a monkey forest, a royal temple and the famous Tanah Lot sea temple. The two of us were driven from place to place in a car provided by the hotel, and accompanied by our own entertaining and knowledgeable guide. This was a very interesting day, and on a different sot of holiday, we'd probably have tried out some of the other tours. ",
                "My one slight complaint would be that the breakfast seemed extraordinarily pricey, not only compared to that on offer in the town (which is probably to be expected) but to hotels I've stayed in in Europe and to the place I often go to for brunch in Chelsea! It was tasty and it did come with a good sea view, but most days, we wandered into the town, which had some great breakfast venues. Other meals, although also expensive, felt like relatively better value - particularly the Indonesian feast I mentioned above, which was about the same price as breakfast. On a similar note, the spa was lovely and I'd recommend a visit, but it's also worth visiting Bodyworks in town, which were also good and offered similar treatments at a much lower price. ",
                "So that's an almost 100% vote of confidence for the hotel itself. Just for reference, I was slightly less overjoyed with some of the things the hotel had no control over. The sea was incredibly wavey, great for a dramatic view and for people who want to surf or bodyboard (which we tried one day using a board borrowed from the hotel) but not so good for those wanting to swim in it, which would have been my preference. I also had mixed feelings about the town, which seemed to have undergone too much development too fast, leaving to it feeling a bit soulless. The beauty of the hotel was not mirrored by many of the buildings out in town. That said, there were some really nice places to eat and drink. ",
                "Overall, I'd highly recommend, particularly if you want a lazy, secluded, romantic holiday where you're planning to spend much of your time hidden away in your hotel.\n"

Manager John Halpin and his staff never miss a beat. They anticipate what you want with grace and style. The grounds are perfectly manicured, service is flawless and the rooms are spotless.

                "Below a short resume about our feelings.",
                "1. FS Jimbaran: Amazing property, beautiful gardens, best service (like in all the FS that we have already visit), great hospitality, very big and nice appointed villas with private pools, very good quality of the food. Fantastic new beach club with super nice and cosy restaurant Sundara! The resort is kids friendly with a wide range of activities for the young guests. Everything is perfect except… Jimbaran, small and dirty fisherman village. Will we come back? YES because the hospitality of the staff, the service and Sundara are unforgettable and makes you feel special. ",
                "2. Saint Regis Nusa Dua: very luxurious new hotel with outstanding lobby, main pool and spa. We had a fabulous room (ocean view suite) with top fourniture. The breakfast is an incredible experience (try the lobster omlette). Our daughter was delighted by the kids club. We must say that the children learning center is perfect. The concept is super interesting because it is more like a preschool. Many thanks to all the staff of the CLC ( WAYAN JUARNASIH, CECILA DEWAYANTI, CAHYA) You are doing a great work!!!) The overall experience is very nice but the problem is Nusa Dua because it is a puzzle of resorts without any Balinese spirit. Will we come back? Yes",
                "3. The Chedi Club: After reading all the super opinions about the hotel on Trip Advisor I must say that our expectations were very high. The Chedi is really ok, but nothing so so special. It is a small hotel with positive vibrations but... The Villas are little bit old (problem with WC and shower) and the only one restaurant is quite poor. A big advantage is the butler service. You have a butler for your own disposal. Our butler was very friendly and gave us many good advices. But the main advantage is Ubud with a incredible Balinese spirit. Many superb restaurants and beautiful places to visit. Will we come back? To Ubud for sure, but not to the Chedi Club. ",
                "4. The Oberoi Seminyak: When I booked the hotel, our last destination in Bali in my head was the cherry on the top. From many friends I have heard many good things about the Oberoi hotels in the world. Unfortunately the Oberoi Seminyak was a total disappointment. Let’s start by the positives: ocean front location, well maintained property and Seminyak with all the gorgeous restaurants and night clubs... Now the negatives: The hotel is old, really old!!! I do perfectly understand the meaning of classic luxury ( many time we have spent our holidays in hotels like the Carlton or the Martinez in Cannes…) but this hotel extremely needs to be refurbished. The rooms are small (our was a ocean view villa) with super old smelly furniture (the phones are from the 80’s!!!). The staff is tired as the hotel. They try to pretend to be nice but believe me that they are bad actors!)…The worst are the breakfast. Very limited “a la carte” choice. The food is not healthy. Everything is fat and disgusting. The juices are from bottles. The fruits are not fresh and served hot. Imagine that one day we found ants in the jam. The staff was not even surprised . Ok. After a short talk with the manger they gave us the breakfast for free, but this is really not the point. For me in a hotel of this class this is unacceptable. The price of the food compare to the quality in other hotels and restaurants in Seminyak is a joke. You have only one very crowded pool with hot (not fresh) water. The hotel is child unfriendly. There is NOTHING for children. I do understand that some hotels do not want to have young guests but in such case why put information on the web site that there are kids activities? The check in and the check out was slow and also unfriendly. In that hotel you feel all the time that the staff do not really have the envy to work. They want just your money, but give you nothing instead. Will we come back? NEVER, EVER!!!…For 100% we will come back to Seminyak but will go to the Samaya or the Legian. We have checked. Believe me they are a lot better!\n"

Prior to my four nights at the Oberoi I spent a week at a five star hotel in Ubud with superb food and service, so it had a lot to live up to in comparison.",
                "There were a lot of things I liked about the Oberoi - the great location (walking distance to great shops and restaurants), the beautifully kept grounds, my spacious well-appointed Garden Lanai room, and the wonderfully relaxing breakfasts overlooking the beach. Some other things though detracted from the experience and left me a bit disappointed that the Oberoi didn't match the standard of the property I stayed at in Ubud. ",
                "While overall they were minor irritations, for a hotel that strives to be 'perfect' (as one of the managers told me) they didn't quite meet that standard for me. Dining at the Oberoi is very expensive and the two light meals I had there were of average taste and not good value by Bali standards. At certain times of the day the pool area was at capacity and no sun lounges were available. This meant that on one occasion when I wanted to have a swim I had to sit on the grass until a lounge became free; on some other days I had to put my swim back a few hours until later in the afternoon when it was quieter. ",
                "The beds are very high with a wooden ledge surrounding the mattress. If you're short like me you almost need something to stand on to be able to get into bed, and if you're not careful you can get a nasty knock on your knee from the ledge (which I did). The beds don't have mosquito nets, so you need to spray the room each night to deal with the bugs that have come in. There is also the strange situation at the Oberoi Spa where one of the change rooms available to male and female clients used to the men's locker room and comes complete with urinals! I was advised this was a quirk left over from the original hotel architecture but as a female traveller it was a surprise to come across this 'feature' in a five-star spa.",
                "On balance the Oberoi is a very good hotel but it is competing against some other exceptional hotels in Bali. I'll probably try one of the other top hotels on Seminyak beach next time I go there to see how they compare.\n"

The hotel is a haven of tranquillity from the outside mayhem & traffic of Seminyak but easy walking distance to some great restaurants & shops. ",

The bed was super-comfortable, once you got over the slightly obtrusive wooden border, & toiletries had a beautiful scent of naranji & lime, which were generously replenished daily. ",

                "The food is fantastic; super-good a la carte breakfasts, from traditional western style through to Japanese, Indian & Indonesian. Lunches were equally delicious; afternoon tea with Balinese cakes was complimentary together with demonstrations of local customs. We tended to eat out in the evenings as Seminyak is home to some great restaurants, which are considerably cheaper & generally have a more lively atmosphere.

It's gardens are beautiful and there is lots of acreage on the property to wander around or enjoy the greenery. It's also set back from the busy street and so is very quiet and a nice escape from the traffic. The staff there are amazing and service is second to none. They all make you feel very special and are very kind and pleasant. The afternoon tea, the sorbet at the pool, the craftspeople doing their craft on site every day are all really nice touches. The clientele are mostly older or people with small families and its very, very quiet during the day and at night and the guests really stay to themselves so if you like a bit of a vibe/conversation this is not the place for you. We stayed in one of the garden lanai's which cost $445 a night and so we had a few expectations. The room is very dark even with the curtain open as there is a cotton sheer and you can't open that as the front door opens up to the pathway where others are walking. There is no automatic lock on the door so you literally have to lock yourself in whenever you are in the room which is a little discomforting at night as if you had to quickly evacuate your room it would slow down your exit. The bathroom is not air conditioned so it makes it uncomfortable getting ready in the evening and the tub is not a typical bathtub but instead a stepped down part of the floor that is tiled so you are lying on \"the floor\" when getting a bath. The tub also did not drain properly even though we had the maintenance people over to fix it. Overall, we had a nice experience but for the cost I'm sure there are other choices which offer better value for the money.\n"

There were the usual five star amenities but what truly set the Oberoi apart was the attention to detail. The staff were exceptional, professional, courteous and competent. It was actually difficult to do anything for yourself because the minute you tried to, an attendant would appear to raise your pool umbrella, or adjust your lounge, or offer you a drink. The food was very good, although there are many good choices around Seminyak if you feel like broadening your horizon a bit. A friend of ours had bought a spa treatment for us before we left the states and it was wonderful. beautiful setting and very professional. The only downside to the spa was that it is next to road and although you are separated by trees and shrubs you can still hear cars and motorbikes passing by.\n"

We stayed in a Luxury Lanai room with partial ocean view. Not the largest room in the world, but very comfortable and the bathroom was wonderful...I'm not usually a bath-person, but I used the tub almost every night because it was so enticing. As others have said, the design of the bed frame is a bit odd and isn't easy to get in and out of, but I got used to it and slept fine. One of the best reasons to stay at the Oberoi is the location. You are so close to restaurants (literally next door to the famous Ku De Ta) and shopping. And the Oberoi resort has a fantastic strip of beach...it is absolutely pristine and wasn't at all crowded. We also really enjoyed the pool and the staff was very good about taking drink/food orders poolside. We had a beautiful meal at Kura Kura our first night, and the buffet was very nice experience (although we must take away a few points for the roast pork being undercooked...everything else was delicious). The gamelan/dancing entertainment was FABULOUS - the best by far when compared to the other resorts we stayed at during our trip. And the breakfasts were also the best...so sumptuous and yummy! Overall, we had a wonderful stay at The Oberoi. Thank you so much for making our honeymoon spectacular!\n"

If a lively beach scene, tasty waves and long beach walks with visuals of different beach restaurants and hang-outs sounds fun, then the Oberoi is perfect.

The pool is pretty and relaxing to lounge around - helped by a regular supply of mineral water and fresh fruit skewers and sorbets brought by the friendly staff. We tried the gym and it was decent - if a bit too hot! The room we stayed in wasn't amazing but nice enough and the bathroom was really big - good shower and bath. My only gripe about the room was the bed - way too high with a wooden ledge jutting out at each side of the bed. And of course, I bashed my leg off it! I consider myself fairly agile and it was difficult for me to get in at night. Not sure if all rooms have similar beds - I wouldn't have thought so. The service was, for the most part, really good. A slight slip up at breakfast when it had rained and it seemed everyone headed for breakfast at 10.30am when breakfast ends at 11am. My only real disappointment was the hotel's attitude to late check out. I don't expect late check out to be automatically available but I would have expected alternative arrangements to be easily put in place. They couldn't allow us late check out as our room was due to be taken. They said they could move us to another room for 4 hours (when we needed to leave) for a half day room charge (US$220). I asked if they had any other facilities where we could just shower but they said maybe the spa, maybe somewhere else but I needed to let them know the exact time. This just annoyed me as this must happen all the time. However, we've come across this same problem in other busy hotels in Asia. I just think 5 star hotels should have facilities available for this sort of thing. I mean we pay enough for the rooms. All in all, we had a really lovely trip and love Bali. I'm not sure we'd rush back to this hotel as there are so many other good hotels in Bali but I'm sure anyone who stays here will have a lovely holiday. ",

                "\nI wish we didn't feel this way, but my husband and I just both did not fully enjoy our stay at The Oberoi. This was our first stop in Bali, and driving through noisy dirty Seminyak, we couldn't wait to reach our 5-star hotel. The welcome drink and outdoor check-in was very nice, but things went downhill from there. I must say first that the grounds and architecture are very beautiful and traditional. But after flying for 16 hours, the last thing we wanted was a 25 minute tour of both the property and our room, reviewing every drawer, light switch, towel, remote control, etc. We travel a lot and it was just overkill. The staff is nice but seemed totally amateur, confirming requests 3 times without leaving you feeling confident that they got what you asked for. We almost made the assumption that we did not like the Balinese people, but now having left the Oberoi, I realize it was only their mostly awkward staff that we didn't connect with. ",
                "We stayed for 3 nights and were pretty jetlagged so we spent the first 2 days eating our meals at the hotel like fools! We should have known better but we were lazy. The food was good, but took forever and it is so incredibly overpriced. On our third day, we left for both lunch and dinner, ate like kings, and paid a fraction of the price. We expected prices to be lower outside of the hotel, but not by half. That was extremely disappointing and we really felt swindled. ",
                "Others have mentioned the bed being surrounded by a wood platform - I have a bruise the size of a golf ball on my shin that has not gone away. Just a terrible design, and they should at the very least not drape the comforter over the wood so you can see what the deal is...or have the staff point that out during your extended room tour. That was the one detail we would have actually appreciated being warned about!",
                "To boot, the beach stunk of sewage. I wish we felt differently and I dislike leaving negative feedback, but our expectations were not nearly met, and now that we are at COMO Shambhala, another 5-star resort in Bali, it is so very apparent that the Oberoi is not a 5-star hotel.\n"

All rooms have miniscule balconies which are not private (saw people lying in their beds if balcony doors were left open), and the family room is without a bathtub and has a tiny bathroom with very limited space. For a room that is advertised to sleep up to 4 people it is quite cramped. Buffet breakfast was adequate. We were not able to relax in the pool area as the concrete 'deck' surrounding the kids pool was extremely slippery when wet, our kids slipped over numerous times just walking around, a bit worrying for us with little kids - and water is freezing as the whole pool area is shaded for most of the day. Good for a short stay I suppose, and if you plan on being out and about all day, but would choose another hotel if we came back to the Legian area.\n"

The iPod dock in the room was a welcome touch and allowed me to both charge my iPod and listen to music when I wished.

A king size bed was comfortable with handy light switches if I wished to read in bed. ",

There's a nice little pool bar by the second, small children's wading pool, and the friendly staff provide drinks and one can order food from the hotel restaurant, to be eaten at the bar or by the pool.

There is a good selection of other foods which change a little daily. Mostly Western but with some local and other Asian dishes such as fried rice and/or noodles. Rice porridge is often an option as is a rather tasty mashed potato - unusual texture but well worth a try if you love garlic. Other offerings regularly include small sausages (pork or chicken), grilled tomato, lovely grilled eggplant/aubergine and there are condiments such as soy sauce, fresh diced chilli, tomato sauce and kecap manis. Pots of tea and coffee on the buffet benches are kept well filled, and occasionally a waiter or waitress may offer a refill at the table. Brown, white and multigrain breads are available for toasting and from memory there were a few types of roll as well. A selection of fresh fruits vary a little daily, typically papaya, watermelon, pineapple and sweetmelon, likewise with the two juices. Lastly there's a very good selection of sliced and diced vegetables for salads, with various dressings available.",

The beds were very comfortable and the linen clean and fresh. We especially liked the outdoor shower (I want one at home!!!). The indoor shower is over the bath and is pretty awful but who would even use it with the outdoor one there? The staff were always friendly and polite and nothing too much trouble. We found the pool to be way too cold for us but as the weather wasn't overly hot we didn't mind at all. There was a nice breeze going through the hotel so sitting on the verandah of the room with a cold Bintang was perfectly adequate!! Breakfast was pretty good, rotated every second day and always fresh and plenty of it. Again, nothing over the top but more than enough choice for the average person with eggs any way you liked and bacon cooked as you ordered, Coffee machine coffee much better than the coffee in the jug. We had only one evening meal which was nice and reasonably priced. We had a cocktail in the bar on a couple of nights and the staff were fun and friendly. At night after 9pm it was very quiet, no street noise or nightclubs or noisy bogans :) ",

Location is just behind Padma, which is tripple the price, and only 1 block back from the beach. Airport pick up was good even though our flight was delayed 2 hours arriving in the early ours and our driver was still there to greet us with a smile. Cool drink on arrival is a nice touch, fast check in is a bonus. Overall in Bali you ultimately get what you pay for, if you're after a clean room in a resonalbe location that you are just using as a base and not laying around the pool all day, then this could be worth a look. If you want luxury on the beach, try Padma or Mandira but you will pay $$$ for it. There are some nice restaurants around Legian but we prefer the variety in Kuta. Good hotel for families on a budget.\n"

We booked a ground floor room which provides an outlook directly over the pool. These rooms are modern and clean and come with the choice of a traditional shower or outdoor rainwater shower. The staff were extremely friendly and something I really liked was that the hotel manager makes the time to interact with his guests. The pool is located in the centre of the property and as such only receives a half a day of sunlight which means that the water is a liitle on the cooler side. If there was one negative it would be the lack of seating poolside. Would definitely recommend and stay again.\n"

All the staff were friendly, pleasant and helpfull, during the whole stay can only recollect one person who did not smile.... The hotel is close to restaurants, bars and within easy distance to Kuta and Seminyak. The room was average size with a nice balcony and kept extremely clean. In fact we spent most late evenings drinking and relaxing on the balcony overlooking the pool. I do not recall any hotel being so quiet and tranquil on an evening. We specifically asked for a room on the top floor, however, ans many readers have mentioned there is no lift......The buffet breakfast was adequate however a bit repetative after six mornings. One slight issue was the toaster it was known when we arrived the first moring that it was not working properly and that was still the case when we left - could sometimes take 10 minutes to get a slice of toast. The pool area was nice however the main let down of the hotel in my mind was the pool itself - being in the shade it was cold, not a pleasant temperture that allowed you to relax. It was a quick swim then out, this seemed to be the case for most guests. Will definatley stay at the All Seasons on our next visit, hopefully next year.\n"

All Seasons was by far the best hotel I have had the pleasure of staying in, with friendly smiling and knowledgeable staff, king size beds, wifi 24/7, room service 24/7, shuttle services and top security. Fully serviced every day while I went to the biggest breakfast...a full buffet that left nothing out! The Manager took the time to speak with us regularly and even joined us for coffee several times. On our last evening in Bali, we decided to eat at the hotel restaurant as it exceeded the menu at many of the outside restaurants, and we were not disappointed, and followed up with cocktails by the huge pool. The pool has a bar deducted to pool goers, surrounded by beautiful flowering pink frangipanis. We made good use of the professional spa facilities, received the best foot massage and pedicure I have ever experienced. I am shocked and disappointed to see that this hotel is only rates 3.5 stars, as I would easily give it five stars without hesitation. The hotel is well situated close to all of the wonderful shopping, money exchange, buddy Marley tattoo shop, moped rentals and taxis go by regularly. All if the staff are fluent with English, and always a pleasant smile and greeting. I will definitely Italy be returning to Bali, and when I do, I will definitely be staying with the wonderful staff at All Seasons. Thank you so much for making my first holiday inverse as so memorable and pleasant. I hope to see you soon. Oh, and the bed and pillows was the BEST .\n"

                "\nWe just returned from a ten day stay at the All Seasons. It was our first trip to Bali and we were very happy with the resort, can not fault it at all. The location also is perfect ! We had two Deluxe rooms with the outdoor shower, we never showered inside, the outdoor shower was great ! I was hesitant about the pool after reading previous reviews on how cold it was. Seriously, i think others are being whinges. Yes the pool is cold, but that is what you want after walking around in the sun all afternoon. It was cold for the first 2 mins and then it is lovely, why you would expect a heated pool in Bali gets me. We ate at a few nearby restaurants which were great, La Monde, Legian Pub, Posers Pub on the corner. If you exit the resort and walk to your right there is a tour booking stand, go and see Paskal and he will do you a really good deal, he was lovely to chat to. Look out for Honest John (that's what he calls himself) on the corner selling jewellery, just in front of the money exchanger. We paid $20 AUS for 1 necklace with 4 names on them, you can get them cheaper elsewhere, however we liked John's humor so still ordered through him. Have to make a special mention of the Roo Bar on Legian St, had the most fantastic night there with all the staff, great food, great band, great atmosphere. We traveled with our son and daughter aged 16yrs and 14ys, the staff at the Roo Bar made their nights so much fun, almost like having life long friends. All in all a fantastic holiday and most definantly will be back next year and will stay at All Seasons again!\n"

The view from our balcony across the pool area was stunning. We were at the pool bar end (eastern end - room 316) which does get the full afternoon sun. It would be fine for July/Aug but in the hotter months I would recommend a pool view room on the northern side to avoid the direct sun beating onto the balcony in the afternoon. The meals and beverages were very good quality and reasonably priced and the spa was so very affordable that some of us attended nearly everyday day! A thank you to the spa girls - Dwi, Kade and Ayu for all your pampering! Also, the breakfast staff can't do enough to assist you! Overall the room was clean, some minor points - skirting boards near the bar fridge were a little dirty and one of our white doona covers had a stain on it. To end our trip we had already pre-booked a 3 day stay at a large 5 star hotel nearby. While it had more bells and whistles, we found it lacked soul compared to the All Seasons. The larger hotel also had a serious problem with mosquito's, this was not an issue at the All Seasons who seem to have it under control. We also found the All Seasons to be much quieter at night. Overall, we loved our stay and would return again.\n"

There's a ton of great restaurants within a 10-15 min walk, not mention the beach options and the beach itself is clean and doesn't smell, unlike the Seminyak beach! The location is smack bang in amongst the street markets, but it doesn't take long to get used to. Would defineatly reccommend Wayan as a driver, he can usually be found sitting with security at the gates and only charges a $50 day rate to take you anywhere. All of the rooms are nice, but the ground floor deluxe rooms are definately the best ones and if you are getting a superior room make sure you get a pool view as it's not that nice to have a view of the carpark/street!\n"

Heaps of tv stations, clean, staff are excellent and friendly and you don't have to walk miles to get out to the street or to breakfast.

This was our 4th stay in Westin Nusa Dua in the past 2 years. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary this time. When one of the Westin Experience Manager knew about our wedding anniversary, she immediately talked to her management to offer us a Ocean Suite with a private pool in a discount rate. The room was excellent. Big and comfortable. The private pool was a great additional. although it is small compares to the public pool, but it is deep enough to actually swim. And the suite is right next to the beach. You can access to the beach through the back door of the private pool. On top of the beautiful room, the Experience Manager also decorated the room and made us a cake to celebrate our anniversary. Overall, the resort is very good. Clean, big, right next to a clean beach, the staffs are friendly. And one thing you must try. The Prego Italian restaurant is a must try. The food are excellent in taste and price is reasonable (in Nusa Dua resorts). If you are there in the right day (I think it is Friday), you must try their unlimited Japanese Teppanyaki, it is great. For activities wise, my wife loves the pool aerobic. And I love to run along the beach because there is connected path along all the resorts in that area. It is really a great place for families and for couples.\n"

Nusa Dua is the most well kept, clean and orderly part of Bali with ten or so hotels side by side on the sandy shore, all easily reached by walking along the footpath by the sand. Researched while on a trip last year, we chose the Westin as best suited for our tribe of 3 generations, particularly the grandsons (2, 4 and 6 years). The pools and other activities are superb, they have a kids club and so that everyone enjoys a break, treat your self to a nanny for each child part of the day at ~$5/hour. Shopping is within walking distance - Bali Convention and the cheaper local markets. Cab rides are very affordable and many restaurants are 5-10 minutes away in Tanjung Benoa, or a slightly longer trip to Kuta/Legian etc. The rooms are comfortable and quiet, staff superb and a Westin breakfast sets you up for most of the day while yo enjoy outstanding hospitality. We'll be back next year.\n"

Bathroom was very clean with all amenities you would expect, huge lovely shower. And at a bargain of Rp100,000 you can hand it a bag full of your wet swim clothes to get dried with 3 hours and so you don't have wet washing drying everywhere. ",

Unfortunately most people decided to opt for the regular buffet on the Sunday we met and I felt sorry for the waste of food. Nice thing to do though with an outdoor play area, a video game and tv area, mascot and magician visit. We slept in that day and started our day with the brunch and can recommend the same to the non- early birds. ",

                "There is also a Japanese Restaurant, a Spanish Tapas restaurant, the large breakfast/ all day dining buffet restaurant with different themes every night. You could also hire a personal chef or do a romantic dinner on the beach. This seems a popular thing to do across all those Nusa Dua beach resorts. All restaurant have live music it seems and all restaurants are fairly large. ",

In particular I'd like to thank Indy from your concierge team. Indy not only helped with babysitters, restaurant bookings, gift vouchers for our friends birthday and a surprise cake, but bent over backwards to make our post stay wait for transport to the airport as comfortable and painless as possible. Indy alone made the trip a success so thank you!",

                "\nWe decided to stay at the Westin resort for the last 3 days of our 19 day trip through Borneo and Bali. The last days we wanted to relax in the sun flat out before heading back. All of the resorts in Nusa Dua seem to offer more or less the same - large pool areas with sunbeds, own beaches with sunbeds, 4-6 restaurants with various themes. Westin was nothing different from the neighbouring resorts. Westin is very family friendly and thus attracts alot of families with small children. As we were a young couple we found some quieter spots around the resort which we enjoyed. If staying around the busy pool area it seemed a bit challenging to relax due to the activity level. It is indeed possible to stay at the resort and get a bit peace and quiet. When we arrived at the hotel we were swifly checked-in and followed to the room in the new part of the resort complex (premium rooms). The room was spacious with mini bar, AC, large closet, satelitte TV, large bathroom with bath tub and huge shower. The room was clean. Room service came every afternoon to offer additional towers. We did not use any other facilities on the hotel than the beach. The beach on the resort lost the sun around 16:30, which was fine for us after 6-7 hours in the sun, but the professional sun bathers might want to consider a hotel on the opposite side of Nusa Dua than the Westin. The breakfast on the hotel was very good with everything you could ever want, but very busy with all the hotel guests - queues and people everywhere. Room service breakfast for approximately the same price and without the risk of overeating on the tempting buffet station. The service at the hotel was excellent and all employees very friendly. A great end to a fantastic vacation.\n"

I've traveled the world for business & pleasure, have stayed at many 5 star resorts (Four Seasons, etc.) and I would put the Westin Nusa Dua up there with the best. ",
                "What truly makes this place magical for families is a seamless blend of activities for kids (kids club staff welcome our daughters by name and always have engaging art, sport, and local traditions planned throughout the day), very gracious and professional staff throughout the property (everyone is always smiling, there is never a piece of rubbish on the ground, and they are very accommodating of even the smallest requests), very modern and spacious rooms (we had a family suite- highly recommended if you have a couple of little ones in tow)-- incredible and relaxing bath, and tasty seasonal menus in each of the restaurants (our favorite being Ikan at the beach-- good parent's happy hour, breakfast buffet is perhaps the best I've experienced in terms of freshness, daily variety, and ambiance). ",

                "We were able to easily arrange tours from the property to Ubud/other points of interest within short day excursions and nanny/babysitter service for the evening so we could have some time dining sans kids (much less expensive than Sydney & totally trusted through their service). ",
                "The beach has a good mix of sun and shade, calm water to wade in with the kids, and plenty of lounge options to ensure comfort. The kids pool is well-shaded (bonus!) and has a cute frog water fountain in the middle. The adult/older kid pool is lagoon shaped with several sections of depth + a water slide, actively managed by lifeguards. You never have to fight for a beach or pool spot as we've had to with other resorts.. overall, well-planned outdoor layout.",
                "We never heard \"I'm bored\" or \"when are we going home\"- so I'm glad that we extended our stay to capture a few more days in paradise (even though mother nature did have a hand in keeping us here/safe). Not a bad place to be \"stuck\" at all- I'd just recommend getting travel insurance for your trip to Bali. We didn't, but will upon on our next booking!\n"

What makes The Westin the best, is that they've thought of everything so you can have a relaxing stay. From the very beginning, when we were picked up from the airport, the staff were kind, knowledgeable and helpful. The breakfast in the morning had everything on offer, served by friendly faces. The Kids Club is amazing, our 4 year old daughter begged to go everyday, as they do proper supervised activities. The pool was clean, well maintained and it was easy to get a drink/food. The beach was clean and again well served. The spa was a wonderful experience, recommended! Anything we asked for was done, bookings for restaurants, taxis etc. Nusa Dua is a great location, it's not particularly authentic Balinese (I suggest you get out a bit) but it's super clean, and has shopping facilities at The Bali Collection down the road.

                "\nWe had a 5 night stay here. Had booked 2 rooms here, one as a base room, and a second one as a base as well which we got upgraded to a 1-bedroom suite using suite night awards. ",
                "The hotel is located in the Nusa Dua area which is great if you like resorts but it is rather secluded and you are limited in your options for things in the area. Typically a cab from the airport is approx IDR 100,000 plus tolls. We took a van since we were multiple folks and a decent bit of luggage and we got a van for IDR 200,000 after some haggling. The resort really isnt far and with the new toll road, its between a 20-25 minute journey. Do yourself a favor though and call an Uber. The price is about IDR 60-70000 for a van with toll included. Much nicer and comfortable and you know you aren't getting ripped off.",
                "Check in was ok and I got the feeling the hotel was just about willing to do the bare minimum in terms of benefits. As a platinum benefit I chose breakfast, but they said only one room would get breakfast even though both are under my name. That is accurate according to the terms but I have been to plenty of hotels where the idea is to give the guest a pleasurable experience rather than stick to the terms. So anyways we decide to skip on breakfast after finding out its an additional $27 per person which is a ton of money in Indonesia.",
                "The base room was fine. The room itself was a bit on the smaller side with a very large bathroom though which was quite nice. Both rooms didnt have much in terms of views. The suite was quite large with lots of space to move around in. Again a large bathroom which was quite nice. Wifi worked well. Plenty of plugs by the bedside. ",
                "We had some issues with the water. The water in the shower would take a crazy amount of time to warm up. One day it took about 20 minutes before we got hot water. The next day we got hot water in under 5 minutes. We showered at different times daily due to different schedules and it was always hit or miss. Im not sure if it was due to the time of the day and the load on the showers or what but for a hotel of this caliber, hot water on demand should be a given. That was definitely annoying over 5 days.",
                "Platinums also get complimentary afternoon tea from 3 to 5. Again, this wouldn't be extended to the second room so we only tried it out once and didnt bother the other days. But it was pretty decent with a nice large selection of teas and coffees as well as plenty of tea time snacks. I think it was $10 a person if you weren't platinum. Not too bad but then again considering how much $10 would get you outside, not really a great deal either. You couldn't get the platinum breakfast to go either. If you wanted it to go, you had to wake up before 6 am.",
                "Wifi worked well at the hotel. Plugs were plentiful by the bedside and there was a working area as well. We received a fruit platter amenity on the first day and then a plate of focaccia bread on one of the others. The pool area is fairly nice. They do offer a bunch of activities through the day which differ daily. We did wind up doing the intro to scuba diving one of the days. Nobody else had signed up for it so it was pretty much a private class in the pool and the instructor was really nice.",
                "The Westin beach area is quite nice and its a shared beach with the public as well as the surrounding 5 or so resorts. It generally tends to be busy. Looking at the ocean, follow the pathway all the way to the right until it ends, You will find a handful of local shops where you can get local priced food and souvenirs. The hotel also offers shuttles to the nearby bali collection which is basically a mall. Typically this isnt really worth your time since everything is very over priced. You are just paying for convenience. We wound up going to one of the marts inside to pick up alcohol and a bottle of Bacardi rum was over $100! Insanity. We grabbed a bite at one of the restaurants and then left. Dont waste your valuable vacation time here, you are better off calling a cab and heading to Kuta instead.",
                "Overall this was an ok stay. I have stayed at the Laguna next door and I think I found the experience there to be overall better. Will probably stay there if I return to the area.\n"

The food throughout the hotel was of an exceptionally high standard and the room service meal was to be applauded. The deluxe, pool view room was bright and spacious.

                "\nWe had 3 generations staying in two rooms for a week--a family suite for the grandkids & parents, and a deluxe pool room for us. The rooms were excellent--well designed, quality fittings, and very comfortable. Nothing is far away in the resort-- rooms are close to reception, to the pools, to the restaurants and to the beach--means it's never hard to pop back to the room from whatever you are doing. The pools come in different depths--the main pool is probably too deep in most parts at around 2 metres, but there is also a toddlers pool and a pool at about 1 metre deep which is perfect for little kids. The water slide is a hit for the 10 year olds or so. The beach is clean, safe, and pretty free of hawkers. The walk along the beach front in both directions passes lots of other nice resorts- at night the restaurants extending down to the beach are great. We tried 4 different restaurants in the resort, and they were all good--the outdoor buffet night was outstanding. The staff all try very hard and are really nice-- they make little kids very welcome, and our grand kids had a ball. The broader Nusa Dua area is safe, beautifully landscaped, and now only 20 minutes from the airport on the new tollway. We couldn't fault our week- great time for our whole party. Highly recommended for family holidays\n"

After time at the beach and pool it is relaxing to sit and read on the terrace .This was our third visit to The Westin in three years and although some things have changed it was still a enjoyable time . We missed the Capsicum Restaurant which has been replaced by a new venue . Breakfast now does not seem as relaxing as previously as it just felt like eating in a huge cafeteria , however there is still a wide variety of food . Beer was never cold at Ikan Bar and restaurant this visit , or when ordering from pool or bar service .Maybe this is more a problem when hotel busy and refrigerators opened constantly .As usual service and staff excellent .A nice touch was afternoon snack which was delivered to our room daily and morning newspaper (we are SPG members ) Special thanks to Artayemna,Dec,Hardi,Agus,Arya Sringanau and Effin at the Ikan , Andi for beach service ,Lina (the wonderful Assist.Guest Exp Manager ) as well as our old friends Satryani ,Astini and Aspira .

                "\nGood family vacation. The exterior is clean and during day time, the hotels is in a full party, kids having fun and adults equally having their time of their life from the beach, pool, kids club to restaurants. The hotel layout is huge so a bit of walk to the room. The deluxe room is smaller than expected and dusty. Not so well maintained. Having a baby, we tend to look out for dirts and dusts in case of allergy. If you are going there with a baby that tends to crawl or walk, book a bigger room and which we intend to do next time. Check in is perfect, Ms Lina introducing the hotel outlets and what to do in the hotel. She asked for my child's name at the lobby while my husband checked in and remembered it throughout our stay as we bumped into her at the beach, pool and lobby. She is omnipresent. A nice Westin Kids bag is given to every child and instantly you know it is child friendly hotel. It is reflected in the hotel room service menu, kids pool, breakfast kids area and the kids club indoor and outdoor and even the room amenities such as the very much appreciated bed rail guard. Ms Winnie from the Front Desk is very helpful and friendly, persuading us to come back to stay with them the next time as we were weighing between Mulia or Westin. Shuttle bus to Bali Collection is provided but on first time first serve basis, with the baby, we simply took a taxi for convenience. Shuttle bus can be a bit difficult with babies as it is quite small with many hotel guests sitting together in circular seats. Come night, the hotel seems to be extremely quiet. Only the Japanese restaurant and Prego has some diners. While when we walked past Ikan restaurant, we can see frustrated diners raising their hands asking for service. Prego is quite expensive and the food is so so. For lunch, it is recommended to go to next door hotels connected by the beach but most of the guests ordered lunch to be consumed by the pool. Dinners was quite good and reasonable at Bali Collection. ",

They set up the wedding beautifully and the ceremony and reception was stunning. Lovely hotel!!!\n"

                "\nI just recently returned from visiting this property with my family including two young kids. The very big plus of this property is that it is incredibly family friendly. While we were checking in my wife went over to the bar to ask for some milk for our kids as it was approaching bedtime - without hesitation they gave them each a glass.",
                "Check in- Smooth and Fast. They did a great job of explaining the Westin Kids Pass and gave our kids welcome kits complete with hats, toys and re-fillable water bottles - these were a big hit as they could have unlimited juice. What kid wouldnt be in heaven.",
                "Room - we check in to a family suite on the ground floor. As an SPG platinum member who has booked many suites around the world, I have to say the most underwhelming part of my visit to this property was this room. We had originally booked two connecting Deluxe Rooms and for the cost to upgrade to this \"suite\" - i would save your money. The connecting space is small and dark (no windows) and does not have a daybed or sleeping area. The doors between the doors do not stay open making it very challenging it you have young children who need to be able to get to you in the night.",
                "Restaurants - breakfast was great each day. Plenty of variety and quick and efficient service. We only ate dinner at the resort on arrival but service was fast, food was good.",
                "Kids Club - This was my greatest disappointment about this property. The actual kids club - both the toddler and bigger kid one was beautiful, clean, and well staffed. Where I thought this property failed miserably was in making the rules at the kids club and having their staff effectively communicate them. There is a toddler club for kids ages 0-4 where kids must be supervised. The bigger club is for kids 4 and above with the exception being kids 2-4 can join as long as their are 1) with a parent or caregiver and 2) fully toilet trained. I completely understand the first part as supervision is essential for the safety of the child and the children in the club. I could not for the life of me understand part 2. I was told by the staff on multiple occasions that my son was welcome to stay but only if i removed his nappy. My son is 99.9% toilet trained. I told them the nappy was on as we were not in a familiar space and he may have an accident and I would hate for him to have it on the equipment. They repeatedly told me that it didn't matter and he could only stay if I took it off. It does not make sense to me that staff would want to encourage people to let their children have accidents rather than supervise them and ensure the kids club stays safe and clean. I did read other reviews about this \"problem\" before arriving and would have hoped it would be solved. May people with young children have them close in age and it is quite silly for a resort that is so kid friendly to force parents to separate their children. The staff could also use a better understanding of why this rule was in place as I was not the only annoyed parent.",
                "Pools - beautiful and warm. Slide is great and there are a few shallow areas for kids. The childrens pools are quite small in size. The main pools are over 6ft deep making it quite hard to have a relaxing dip in the pool either as an adult or child.",
                "Overall, I would visit again as the property is beautiful and clean and very child friendly. The beach is nice, food is great and service is good. Next time we will opt for regular connecting rooms or a 2-bedroom suite over the \"family\" suite and hope the property changes the kids club rules which would make this the ultimate relaxing family getaway.\n"

Also enjoyed healthy and sumptuous breakfadt served in the beach side restaurant overlooking the ocean. Enjoyed staying upto late nights at the beach with plenty of sunbeds and cabanas.

The rooms went through major changes and they added a new premium wing. I absolutely loved the way they renovated the bedroom. Large windows made the room extra bright and cheerful, the bathroom positioned as such that it felt extra large and airy. There were a lot of niches providing ample storage spaces without looking too busy. The bed was also extra comfy with just the right amount of pillows to make me sleep like a baby.",
                "Now on to the failings. The air con was not working properly and my room felt hot during the night even after setting it up to the max. A technician came over the next day and although it did feel a bit better we still could't have it colder than 23 centigrade. Somewhere during the night the temp raised up to 26 by itself. ",
                "And although most of the personnels were great, there was definitely room for improvement. Room service meal was delivered by a non-smiling staff who frowned at me (perhaps tips in USD are much more appreciated than IDR?). The service express staff was impatient when I tried to tell him about my room air con and cut me by saying he would send a technician right away (but it took him 1 hour to do that). Also, the staff at front door just shrugged when I inquired on the shuttle bus schedule to BINDCC. I tried to ask again and he pointed to the schedule list (half hidden by a tree) with his chin. Where is the excellent service in that? ",
                "On my last day I slipped and fell in front of my room since the floor was wet. I could only assume that other guests were back from the beach or the pool dripping wet but it is part of the hotel's responsibility to make sure the wet floor did not cause a problem for other guests. I was lucky not to have more serious injury other than bruised bums and bruised pride but it could have been worse.",
                "So, even though I loved the room, beach and pool, there was something still lacking to make it a truly 5 stars experience and I think it was the (lack of) sincerity of the service personnels. I truly hope they step up in the service area soon. Local guests are not second to international guests, people! I adore Bali and would love to give 5 stars the next time I stay here.\n"

                "However, though many complain that The Westin and Nusa Dua are not the 'real bali' I still find it a very reliable option. It's a very relaxing place with the beach much cleaner and more inviting than Seminyak. This time breakfast was on the beach while Capsicum is being renovated. This is such a lovely option, with the sea breeze and beautiful open air setting, that I hope it will continue to be offered.",

I also enjoy the fact that there is a beautiful board walk winding around the Westin and all the other five star resorts. It's very safe and well lit at night.the cycling track is also fun, but again I think the Westin needs to reconsider its pricing and some of these things should be complimentary for guests instead of around $15 an hour for oldish bikes.",

We liked the room, but only after we got upgraded (some of the rooms in the main resort are a bit dated and don't have a balcony - we recommend the 2 year old section that is off to the side). The staff overall were extremely friendly. The only minor complaint is we sometimes were forgotten about at the restaurants, and weren't offered water once (not to be a prima donna but most restaurants naturally offer you a glass of water). The pool facilities were really good. Lots of beds and lounge chairs. There is 1 waterslide for kids, but this definitely is not a kids first pool (e.g. main pool is over 2 meters deep). The kids club is good, but not great. The good is that there is a large playground, plenty of organized activities such as craft making. The not so good is we were forced to put our 2 year old in a separate area than the 7 year old because the younger child wears diapers. They wanted to be together. So overall we enjoyed our time here, but for the price we paid would probably try another option next time.\n"

Service all round is excellent - almost every staff is all-smile and pro-active. The check-in process was exceedingly slow, according to my guide who arrived a day before, so she cleverly got the hotel to prepare all the hotel keys for our entire group upon arrival the next day! Rooms are large, though the balcony is small. I feel that the mattress was too soft for my comfort. There are many pools -with good depth for adult swimmers, and slide for kids. My colleagues' kids joined the kids club- and said it was thoroighly enjoyable. While lounging by the poolside, staff came around to offer popsicles (I had a yellow water melon popsicle, right when I needed something cold!). As for their heavenly spa, I must say it has one of the best ambiences ever - and I totally enjoyed the experience. Regarding room service after midnight, the menu is limited and somewhat disappointing - they had for instance, Chinese fried rice that is vegetarian (?!!!??) and since I was craving for rice I had to order it! Restaurant selection limited - too bad about that! All in all, I still had a superb time so I'm now singing praises for this hotel while waiting for my airport transfer.\n"

We found ourselves having to pay for services that most hotels purporting to 5 stars in the region would now include, particularly sports, water sports and even some of the beach sun beds. The latter is particularly annoying as you use those same beds in advertising on this very page. We found water sports are not available as advertised on the website, sailing for example, and even the non mechanised sports could attract a charge. Few are actually operated by the hotel. At least one and potentially two restaurants were closed for refurb but conveniently not shown as such on the website. One of these closures led to the cancellation of a 'Balinese experience' highlighted to us on check in, and that we and the kids were looking forward to. This was cancelled despite an alternative kitchen being open adjacent to the site. Further we were informed of the cancellation in the afternoon, too late for us to plan a decent cultural experience off site, something that was severly lacking on site. The service was friendly enough but there was a general lack of responsiveness to client comment, e.g my daughter must have told waiters of her birthday on three occasions and nothing happened, and we informed the local staff of all the above issues and again nothing, apart from a suggestion that we seek out the manager before leaving the following day. Well, I couldn't be bothered and am unlikely to bother to return. A potentially 5 star resort let down by a 3 star attitude.\n"

The staffs were very friendly, they treated us the local tourists the same as they treated international travelers, you wont find it easily in other Bali hotels. When I checked in they upgraded my room to be a premium one in a new wing, the room was big, comfort and clean. My kids got the goody bags and there were many kids facilities within the hotel area. The hotel area was awesome, you'll feel relaxed and the beach was what my kids looked for, they were so happy playing on the beach. I was traveling with my mom too and when we checked out the first thing she said was \"we have to go back to this hotel again! 4 days were not enough\" :-). So, if you are considering where to stay in Nusa Dua, don't hesitate to stay at Westin!\n"

I can easily say that this was one of the best holiday hotels I have ever stayed in. We had an amazing time. The only reason I give it a 4 and not a 5 is the beach, which is not really the hotel's mistake. But if you are going to Bali for its beaches, then probably this is not the best place. Hardly any guests were using the beach. It was steep with very strong water current and the water was dirty and full of wooden twigs that would keep hitting you with the strong waves. I spent 5 days at Westin and only 5 minutes at its beach :(\n"

The Westin Nusa Dua is very kid-friendly with a nice kids club, free drinks for the kids and discounted meal prices at the pool restaurant. The service is excellent and we were amazed that one of the ladies at the breakfast still remembered us from our earlier visit here in November 2013! The one area of improvement for me is that the prices for the dinner buffets are very steep compared to the restaurants outside the major resorts. It certainly pays off to take taxi and try some of the places a few kilometers away from the resorts. But, all in all, Westin Nusa Dua is a great place with excellent service and wonderful people.\n"

The Westin has been a great choice as there are lots of 4/5* options around. It's beachfront location, midsize, very comfortable deluxe garden terrace rooms on the ground floor for access for the older person was perfect. The staff are just gorgeous, so accommodating and so many that you are extremely well looked after. We ate every day by the beach and the buffet breakfast was always excellent. The BBQ buffet and Italian restaurant dining was also very good. There are lots of activities going on if you want to join in and we did the Cycle Tour one morning with the resident tennis coach which was a great hour spent seeing more of the beautiful coastline & finishing off with an interesting ride through the village - worth doing if your semi-fit! The daily aquasize was a bit of fun too!

                "\nMy husband and I just returned from one week in Bali and Lombok at various SPG resorts (The Laguna, Sheraton Senggigi, and Westin Nusa Dua). Our last night was spent at the Westin Nusa Dua. ",
                "We arrived by air from Lombok and had to call the hotel because they forgot to greet us at arrivals. All was forgiven when we checked into the large resort and found out we had been upgraded to an Ocean View Suite. The room was beautiful (see pictures) and while some may knock the \"chain\" hotels, the Westin brand is well developed and consistently very comfortable and enjoyable (love the Heavenly bed). The grounds were especially impressive with a cleaner beach than the Laguna, beautiful large pools, a great gym and plenty of activities for everyone throughout the day - it seems like a great resort for families. The restaurants are a bit expensive so we made our way back to the Laguna for a more affordable meal. The staff were very helpful and gracious and some even remembered our names, which is especially impressive considering we were only there for one night and the resort is quite large. ",
                "Part of the hotel is under renovation, so the area on the left (left if you are facing the ocean) is noisier than the others but we only noticed this while we were lounging by the pool. One of my favorite aspects was the staff member who passed out pineapple popsicles poolside - such a nice touch and especially necessary considering how hot it was.",
                "If we make another trip to Bali the Westin will certainly be on the top of our list for our stay - a very enjoyable and memorable experience and we were not ready to leave when we did!\n"

                "As an travel agent (prior to children) and SPG gold member I have travelled extensively and stayed in varying standards of accommodation. This was our first visit to Bali as a family and I chose the Westin based on the facilities for the children and overall standard and value for a Nusa Dua Resort.",
                "Overall we enjoyed our stay here. Although pretty and good for paddle boarding don't expect too much from the beach if your from Australia.",
                " The service desk offered from one touch call button in the room was outstanding. I called them multiple times a day.. They were fast, efficient and obliging. They even offered to sterilise the baby bottle, which they did promptly twice each day.",
                " Reception area made a real effort to remember us and greet us and show interest. This could be improved in other areas of the resort.",
                " kids loved the baby pool and kids pool and waterslide. Toddlers and adults not allowed on the slide was dissaponting. Also two kids got ear infections. Maybe water quality could be improved. ",
                " Ikan restaurant a beautiful setting overlooking beach for breakfast with lots of choice to suit every taste. Communication difficult though many staff and chef on cooking station lacking English, which was a suprise for a 5 star resort. Also not impressed when they argued with us when we requested a table for our group of 8. Expect better for a 5 star resort like the Westin. ",
                " The day spa was beautiful, clean and what could be expected from 5 star. Although the hydro therapy pool jets were weak and not worth the effort. Another unimpressive moment was the day spa not obliging a mini facial to add to my seaweed wrap and hair treatment. It took much discussing before they agreed.",
                " Kids menu was limited so we did not purchase the kids bands. Our kids would have been tired of that menu in a day. Kids eat half price off the adults menu and under 3 yrs free, so that suited us best.",
                " unlimited free water bottles delivered to room a big plus. You need to guzzle loads of water it's so hot and easy to get dehydrated. So it's great to have it easily available",
                " Enjoyed pizza and pasta in Preggo. And from a family with Italian background that is a real compliment! Serving size of pasta for a main is embarrassing, three mouthfuls and my husband was finished and still hungry. We spoke with the manager and he said this was normal and we would need to pay for a double main or extra half serve. When a customer gives feedback, accept and improve, please don't blame the guest. ",
                " Big dissapointment was our toddlers not being allowed into the playground with their friends/siblings. What a crazy rule that they must be toilet trained? What difference does it make if they are wearing nappies and are supervised by an adult and especially when no other children are using it. The kids club told us they could use it if we took their nappies off? That would be unheigenic and doesn't make any sense. If Westin are going to maintain this rule they need to upgrade the baby/toddler area, which is tiny and not enough space for very active toddlers. ",
                " Severely lacking in nighttime entertainment. Need to have some adult and family entertainment after dinner. There is no atmosphere after dark and nothing to do in the evening other than eat and go back to the room. Some traditional dancing/puppetry/music would have been great",
                " The blenders are rinsed each time after making a juice or cocktail under the tap. So be warned that residual water is left behind in your drink that could cause illness. The barman confirmed that the water from this tap is not drinking water. Another strange oddity the swim up pool bar did not offer happy hour?. It is very uncomfortable and inconvenient to walk over to Ikan dripping wet to order a drink.",
                " poolside bathrooms needed more regular cleaning they were often smelly and wet and dirty",
                "As mentioned the overall service and facilities and food were of a very good standard but not outstanding. If staff around the resort could be as obliging and efficient as the service desk I'm sure it would come close. In my view true 5 star service is obliging with any reasonable request of a guest without fuss and improvements could be made with wait staff and day spa. A great need to improve toddler area and nighttime entertainment.\n"

                "\nStayed here for 6 nights recently, had decided on the Sofitel but changed my mind because the reviews on here were so good for the Westin - disappointed with my decision. Overall it was just an ok stay didn't experience 5 star service though. Positives about room, bed is amazing and bathroom is huge. Downside we had a baby and they provided a cot but no sheets or blankets, first night she was cold as we used towels the second night our aircon didn't work so she was hot. We expected a balcony we could sit on, the room had one which only fitted one person standing. We have stayed 5 star in Seminyak and every time you leave the room they enter and service, didn't get this here some days we would only have 2 towels for 3 people and small thing but the $5 Pringles I opened in the room were all smashed. Had dinner at ikan, Nasi goring $16 no better than a $7 one down the road. The pool is large but very deep, we had a baby so had to go down the shallow part near the bar that is very small. Only a limited number of beds there which one family took all the whole visit, need more shade for children or a bigger pool for us to take kids in. Found pool service quite slow and some times would have to flag down staff. Tantra was great though, very friendly and attentive. Found the uniforms to be very daggy and most were stained, not the employees fault, how is anyone supposed to keep white and light blue clean in Bali, most had rust stains on them and they are to big and baggy for girls. On the last night we wanted to go to Balinese dinner, called up to reserve but was told not on as a conference was using the space, pretty disappointing. Beach was lovely one afternoon but the next day took the baby for a swim and the water has heaps of rubbish, dirty diapers and all, Westin should have a net cleaning it out as it was horrible. We had a nice stay but could have been so much better. would to Nusa dua but not to the Westin.\n"

I prefer Kuta or Seminyak where there are also nice beaches and pools, but you also have more variety in terms of restaurants and shopping. The restaurants at the Westin are okay but not great. We had a reasonably good meal at Prego (Italian) which surprised us, but the food at Ikan by the beach when we tried local food like satay was pretty bland and not very tasty. Breakfasts were nice and had good variety. To get decent local food you need to go away. The Westin restaurants are also a bit on the high cost side, typical for high end hotel but not typical for Bali. ",

They advised us next day they could change the room and gave us a room with a better view which was done with no problem we were very pleased with the room we were then given. The breakfast was very good with heaps of choice they changed the breakfast area to the one near the beach and closed the Prego.On doing this created a few problems no where to sit as two many were eating at the same time and you had to wait for a table and then we given one in full sun and came away hot and not a enjoyable breakfast. We were sitting round the pool that same morning when a representative from the hotel Lina a trainee came and asked us was everything alright with the hotel etc.We told her the experience we had at breakfast and said not enough room to accommodate everybody at breakfast near the beach she came back later and told us the Prego would be opening again and you can now dine for breakfast either at the Prego or the beach.",

Next day he came to our table in the breakfast area and I can tell you he is a real person and is the Managing Director of the hotel and such a nice person he honestly cares about what people say and works hard to achieve the great results of the hotel and thank him for taking the time to come and say hello. We would definitely recommend this hotel to families couples etc the location is great and the cleanliness of the hotel is 100per cent and will definitely stay at this hotel again.",

On arrival the rooms were very clean and had large bathrooms with a wet room including a big bath. Given we had 2 doubles in a standard room it was squishy and left nowhere to sit but on the bed. Our balcony (5thfloor) was tiny and had no furniture. The ground floor garden view rooms had good sized patio areas with furniture outside so we spoke with reception who were more than accomodating and moved is to a ground floor garden view room at no cost (they are usually more expensive).

There was a basketball hoop, volley ball net and balls in the pool which kept us occupied and I loved the water falls, waterslide and water aerobics. We never had a problem getting sun lounges or day beds. The food menus around the pools were great (kids eat well menu as well as the normal stuff) and the service was fast!

The price is competitive when compared to others in the resort district like Sofitel, etc. (I've booked with Early bird discount at about USD$120/ night, and stayed in the most basic room type with Garden view).",

When check-in the counter staff informed us that we booked the room with double bed, but eventually it's not available and we can only stay in 2 single beds in the 1st night. To manage our expectation she suggested to waive us the breakfast fee as compensation and we are happy on the arrangement. Service Express is very helpful and react prompt, where I called them for a few times per day for request.",

                "Food: Great breakfast buffet at Ikan restaurant! We had it very full every morning. It provide wide variety of cuisine and will be sightly different every day. Like Monday I saw sushi and miso soup, and after that some Indian cuisine. For the variety you can see my photos! Since we wanna spend most of the time inside the resort, we ordered room service for lunch and dinner as well, and had it at pool side. Price is fair at good quality, love the price including all tax and service charge for not being mislead.",
                "Environment: Peaceful and relaxing overall. One can chill in the swimming pool and beach for sunbathing and a bit of swimming for the whole afternoon. View of Nusa Dua Beach is fantastic, clear water and blue sky; The thing I most loved is sitting at the beach side and seeing the view when having breakfast!",
                "Facilities: There were 3 swimming pools in total where we only stayed in the biggest one. Gym room is standard with quite a lot of machines. Chairs and beds on beach were nice but we did not used it. I borrowed a yoga mat at service express to practise inside the room.",
                "Being a yogi and a person who quite considered about wellness, I am impressed by lots of activities being held for wellness purpose, like Run Westin, cycling activities and yoga classes held. Originally wanted to participate in the morning run and Hatha yoga class, but failed to wake up. What a pity!",
                "If I needed to pinpoint some downsides for Westin, it could be the hotel design itself is not a very stylish type of thing. If you are looking for spectacular infinity pool or gorgeous room/ hotel design, you may go for Ayana or Mulia. Westin is more a down-to-earth type, and good value for money!",
                "And the \"Heavenly Bed\" I particularly was not amazed about. I think it's too soft and lack of support. Got a bit back pain after that.\n"

                "\nWe just returned from a 4-day, 3-night stay at the Westin Nusa Dua with our two boys, ages 4 and 7, my husband, my mom, and myself. Overall it was pleasant enough, but there were certain issues that made it a ho-hum stay. ",
                "Positives:",
                "1. Lots of pools and access to beach (look at negatives regarding beach).",
                "2. Had all the amenities you expect from any Westin (look at negatives for things you don't expect from a Westin).",
                "3. Decent food and service. Nothing outstanding, but we didn't run into any rude staff.",
                "4. Low prices. The hotel stay itself was not too bad, nor was the food. The boys were delighted by the crepe station at the breakfast buffet.",
                "5. Lots of SPG gold perks: free tea time, 15% discount at two restaurants, free wifi.",
                "6. Family package included efficient airport transfer and free breakfast, definitely worth it.",
                "7. Overall, we all had a relaxing time and found something for everyone.",
                "8. Decent kids club with lots of activities, but my boys never felt comfortable staying without us.",
                "What could be improved:",
                "1. There was an ant infestation in our room. They were everywhere and it's not a pleasant arrival when the welcoming fruit basket was covered in little ants. Yes, we could've called management and yes, we could've requested another room, but moving rooms after you've unpacked and your kids are already in bed is a major inconvenience. After that, we just kept the food in sealed bags, or in the fridge.",
                "2. Pool area was full of aggressive squirrels and pigeons. Some of the nicer lounging areas were full of active squirrels jumping around the inside of the thatched roof ceilings. The ants were also all over the lounging chairs, so we got bitten a lot, especially when we ate by the pool.",
                "3. Pool area bathrooms are not well kept. They ladies room smelled of urine the entire 3 days and had feces on one of the seats on one day. ",
                "4. Beach water was unacceptably dirty, full of trash, large pieces of broken wood, some with sharp nails. I can take a little seaweed, but when your kids find glass shards and needles, you know there's a big problem. ",
                "5. Kids amenities are so so. At first, we were excited to know the kids could refill their water bottles anytime, until we found out it was only for soda fountain drinks. It was also quite confusing to keep track of what restaurants offered what discounts on kids meals. Food was cheap enough that we didn't think too much about it, but it felt more like a bait and switch.",
                "6. The hawkers on the beach were also quite a nuisance. The same hawker would ask us numerous times whether we were interested in snorkling. It would get to the point where I had to yell to get them to go away, which I hate doing on a supposely relaxing vacation in front of my kids. We were also edge about our belongings when we walked away from our belongings.",
                "I would probably do it all over again, but lower my expectations. If you're looking for a quick, easy, inexpensive get-away to Bali, then it's not bad. If you're looking for Westin-level resort experience, you'll be disappointed.\n"

                "\nWe stayed at The Westin Resort Nusa Dua for 6 nights in November 2014 and had a good time. This Resort is spacious, well laid out and mostly well run; and is situated in what is probably the best area of Bali. The entire experience, from airport pick up through check-in, room quality, the facilities, the staff, the service and the check-out was very good. But I am not sure if any superlative adjectives are in order. ",
                "The hotel had arranged our airport pick up and it was efficient. The check-in was pleasant, fast and well managed. The room quality was good. We thoroughly enjoyed the long beach walks and the occasional evening entertainment. The facilities, including various games and the bank on the premises were thoughtful and good quality. We were by and large quite happy with the food choices – and the different thematic dinners. We are vegetarians, and we had no difficulty in finding food that we liked. We were also quite happy with the tours the Hotel arranged for us.",
                "There were two incidents which slightly marred our otherwise excellent stay:",
                "1. There was a drainage/leakage problem in our bathroom. We brought this to the attention to the Hotel’s “Service Express” and the problem was attended to while we were away for the day. However, the issue is that a Hotel of Westin’s standard should have proactively identified the problem and rectified it BEFORE the guest checked in, and not AFTER the guest pointed out the issue – especially so considering that this was lean season. It is often the small issues that distinguish the Excellent from the Good.",
                "2. The second problem was an issue with the food. On the day before our departure, I found a small metal piece in my dinner plate (it was a pasta dish). I consider myself lucky to have found the unwanted item while it was still on the plate. There were the standard expressions of contrition from the restaurant staff and (on the following morning) a personal apology from the chef; but this is something that is completely unacceptable, whatever the explanations or circumstances.",
                "Overall we were quite happy with our stay at the Westin. We would definitely consider choosing the Westin on our next Bali trip, on the assumption that the Hotel would by then have taken steps to ensure that the few glitches of the type we experienced do not occur again\n"

Seafood BBQ by the pool was again excellent. Also, the buffet dinner at the Japanese restaurant was a very good experience ! I would be more nuanced about the \"surf and turf\" one... The Italian food at Prego is fine. One small disappointment: Capsicum was under renovation, so the breakfast was at the Prego restaurant: I hope that when we go back there, which is probable, the breakfast at the Capsicum will be something even better than in the past :). The SPA is very expensive for Bali but it is really a high level one with very good service and competence !!!\n"

                "\nI was here with my family easter 2013. We were three families actually. We had a great time together. Location of the hotel is directly a nice, quiet beach in Nusa Dua. We had a family suite as our daughter had a friend visiting from Norway. The hotel convinced us from the very beginning. Typical balinese style lobby area without being kitchy. I believe the hotel was pretty newly renovated at the time actually. Our suite was spacius, a front room with TV, wardrobe, sofa, a desk, from there it led to two spacious, newly renovated rooms with big bathroms, the most practical wardrobes I have ever encountered in a hotel room and the most wonderful beds! The breakfast buffet was good. My daughters friend has severe gluten allergy and I had worried quite a lot about having her visiting us in Indonesia as she can become acutely, severely ill if she eats the tiniest piece of gluten, but the hotel turned out to be great in many ways, also for people with allergies. First thing upon check in was them having her and our groups photography taken to distribute it to the different restaurants on the hotel premises. They had menus where it was clearly stated what she could eat and not, at all times they would answer any question regarding her diet and if the staff did not know or where not sure, they would go and at most times get back with a proper answer. At any buffet we visited, the responsible manager of the buffet personally guided us through the buffet showing her what she could eat and not. The quality of the food was so good, made mostly from scratch apparently as she could eat almost everything at most meals, which to me is a sign of good quality restaurants. I felt so comfortable and secure about her well being and health that we decided to extend our stay there a couple of days. The beach was nice, quiet and beautiful which suited us well after having experienced how the earlier fantastic Kuta and Seminyak beaches has developed into horrible places full of garbage both on the beach and in the water.

The downside is that you don't feel like you are experiencing much of Bali. Also, because you are in Nusa Dua it is difficult to get reasonably priced food choices. even the restaurants right outside Nusa Dua are pricey. You have to get a taxi and go further away which isn't convenient when you are geared up for hanging out on the beach. But, if cost isn't a concern, everything is readily available at the resort itself.\n"

This was not possible.Nonetheless we waited with a sea full of people in the lobby. I think this overwhelmed the receptionist thus the reason for her not making an exception.The room was old and humid and had a smell of mildew. Chalking it up to just the general scent of the Westin, we went with the flow. The next morning i decided that i should take off my grumpy hat and ask about changing rooms.",

Overall keeping everything in perspective-- its nusa dua and it cant help its humidity nor heat. However the Westin went from piss poor to giving it a good try. The pools are great, its on the beach and the food is wonderful. Balinese people and their hospitality made staying at the Westin worth it.

We have nothing to say but fantastic things about our whole experience at the Westin. The location was not far from the main centre of Kuta 20-30 mins so if you wanted to do something there it wasn't a problem (use the blue taxis as they are metered and we went to Splash water park which was a good 40 min away and cost $9- \"heery\" was our driver and was lovely, very good English) The staff (& there was plenty of them) we very helpful polite happy people.. They went out of there way to do anything they could to help you. Matt and others at the pool bar were lovely and gave frozen watermelon Popsicles and slush puppies free of charge to the children which was a lovely added touch!! Our room service was amazing and every detail was beautiful!! The pools and resort was very moden and luxurious... From checkin to check out our stay at Nusa Dua was lovely... There was security everywhere from the moment you got through the gates at nusa dua. They aren't intrusive at all. The grounds at the Westin and right along the beach front to all the other resorts was nothing but immaculate!!!! The Indonesian people were extremely lovely people and I would recommend coming here to nusa dua if you want a lovely relaxing family holiday... Our kids loved the water slide at the Westin and gave the fishing a go at the Kids Club... Although our kids didn't use the kids club I've only heard how great it is there... There was a playground and Rock climbing wall inside the kids club as well as an enormous amount of activities to do every day that ranged from kids yoga to weaving to braclet making.. There was even a \"teens club\" that had mini golf, bike riding, soccer etc etc etc to keep the older kids busy..... The only complaint we had was that the drinks (soft drinks/beers) were always hot at every restaurant and bar at nusa dua (not just at the Westin) we thought maybe stubbie holders could be given out when purchasing a drink or a bucket of ice to keep your drinks cool whilst your swimming/dining. The fridge in both our rooms weren't very cold but we didn't complain as it wasn't a major issue due to the fact we wernt drinking anything out of them.. The food at all the resorts are expensive (for bali) but we paid the price due to the convenience. Some nights there was entertainment and the kids always loved the fire dancers.... The beers were always around $5-6 aud which is once again pricey but given your in a resort we expected that..",

                "\nWe chose Westin Nusa Dua for the second leg of our Bali holiday. On arrival we were greeted by traditional Balinese dancing, cold drinks and a refreshing towel. My friend had been to Bali in August and chosen our ground floor two bedroom family suite to accommodate 2 adults and three children.",
                "• At the check in counter we were approached by apologetic management who explained the chosen room was not available due to the hotel being booked to capacity (short term panic). They assured us that they would be able to look after our needs. This is where the fantasy began (we were not dreaming). For one night only we would sleep in a two bedroom family suite on the fourth floor and this room was available immediately (12.00noon) although check in was not until 4.00pm. On the second day at 4.00pm we would transfer to a two bedroom ocean view suite 926 sq ft / 86 m² with an additional interconnecting room, making our total accommodation 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, dining, lounge and private pool with direct beach access. ",
                "• We were offered a complimentary lunch at Prego (on Good Friday the Lobster was perfect). We were also offered complimentary afternoon tea for the duration of our stay each day at 3.30pm. On the first day we ordered a cappuccino and an iced latte. Within moments of arriving each day, our cappuccino and iced latte were prepared to perfection. We were greeted by name each day and when we didn’t turn up one day a plate arrived at our door later that day. Afternoon tea was a no-kids zone and so this was also special. Thank you Indy for serving us each day with your beautiful smile and warm personality!!",
                "• When we thought the Westin had done everything to compensate for their error, there was more. An offer of a beach gazebo for our use for one day (beautiful and relaxing). We were also given late 6.00pm check out for one room on the last day and transport to the airport for our connecting flight.",
                "• Apart from the amazing treatment we received from the Westin staff and management, the breakfast selection was everything that one could ever need. Meals in Prego (Italian restaurant) were guaranteed fast and fresh. The warm complimentary crusty bread with each meal was a beautiful touch and the children said the smoothies were the best in Bali! Chef Alex enjoyed chatting with patrons at the tables and we enjoyed talking to him too. ",

                "We have just got back from our 8 night stay at The Westin and we have nothing but praise for our whole experience. The main purpose of our holiday was to chill out and take a well deserved rest from otherwise very hectic lives. From the airport pick up and the check-in to the check-out and drop off, we really felt well and truly pampered and taken care of.",
                "We decided to take advantage of the SPG kids pass which I must say for kids under 12 was perfect. For just $15 per day, kids could eat as much as they wanted, and for once it doesn't have this \"not including\" thing! That meant the breakfast buffet, kids menu for lunch, ice creams, drinks, buffets for dinner at Ikan were all included. Most definitely worth it.",
                "We used the kids club almost daily. It was great as you could just drop in and sign the kids up as and when they wanted. They had some novel activities--origami, wall climbing, coconut leaf creations but the highlight was the kite making and kite flying. Wonderful to see all these happy kids flying their kites on the beach one afternoon. The teens zone is also very trendy and my older kids used that sometimes. My husband used the gym regularly--it's open 24 hours and next to it are 2 pool tables. We played tennis on the courts too! ",
                "We used the watersports located on the premises and the hotel deals with a very professional company who come and collect you from the hotel and take you to their nearby watersports centre. That meant no noisy motorized water sports on Nusa Dua beach so you really do get peace and quiet.",
                "The pool areas and gardens are absolutely beautiful--gardens are so well manicured and pools maintained. The guys working around the pool café were brilliant--always on their feet and running around in the heat, making sure they delivered your food and beverage orders promptly.",
                "We ate at the hotel often--we thought breakfast was an excellent array of choices, especially the hot food which had all the favourite stations (don't miss those huge crepes with chocolate sauce!!) as well as a variety of other specialities which were changed daily (Indian, Chinese, Japanese etc). We normally had lunch by the pool, again excellent food and service (we won't forget Julianta!). The food in this hotel is not only a high standard but very reasonably priced. We ate twice at Ikan, once for the Surf and Turf BBQ, once for the Indian Buffet and both were very good. On Easter Sunday we booked the Brunch at Prego which was amazing--such a fun and relaxed atmosphere with the balloons, magician etc. Food was extremely tasty, especially the seafood station and fresh fish which they cook in front of you. The chef and even the GM made a point of coming over to say hello to us, which was much appreciated. Most of all we were so grateful that the food was halal and signed accordingly for the non-halal items. We also ordered in room dining twice:- again, very efficient service and delivered and presented so well!",
                "Our room was on the 5th floor overlooking the gardens and we had an interconnecting room with the 3 kids sharing next door to us, which we felt was more than adequate. We preferred this location, as it wasn't overlooking the pool but also not too far away for easy access. Bathrooms are spacious. The TV has a really wide range of channels if you want to put your feet up in the evening and watch a good movie or sports event. And the beds really are heavenly!",

It wasn't cheap but we wanted to get out and see the real Bali outside the usual tourist traps. Unfortunately they took us to a series of tourist shops where we were ushered in to buy things we weren't interested in. This was despite being very specific with the guide about what we wanted to see and where we wanted to go. We spent most of the 8 hours stuck in traffic and didn't get out of the built up areas of Bali which was really disappointing.

Check in took a while for us despite the lack of queue but it was because the front desk agent was making sure that we were getting the best rate and telling us about the Westin Kids Eat Free programme. Meanwhile the children were entertained with the Westin Backpack that had art materials, a really handy waterbottle that could be filled at any of the restaurants in the hotel for free with anything the kids wanted, hat and other treasures. If you are travelling with children, it is worth considering paying just $15 per child per day so that the children can snack anytime at the restaurants or at the pool and eat from the kids menu or the buffet even when the adults don't. The flip side is that the adults need to order two entrees to accompany them but the savings are tremendous especially when you count the number of drinks and icecream sundaes, chips and meals poolside that they consume. The only thing to note is that right now the hotel is undergoing refurbishment so only 2 restaurants are open- the Japanese restaurant and Ikan, the casual dining option. As Ikan is open to the beach, there are lots of squirrels and birds that the staff at restaurant will show you how to feed. That was the highlight of every meal for the children.

                "\nWe just got back from 6 nights at the Westin with my 3 year old son. It is perfect for families but at the same time parents can enjoy themselves too. The food in the restaurants was simply fantastic with high quality and lots of options. My son had all his meals free and there were lots of activities at the kids club. My husband and I had a great time at the beautiful spa, enjoying the complimentary use of the salt wall sauna and thermal pool. The beach was clean and water warm, but do beware of jelly fish. From the moment we stepped foot in the hotel until the time we left the staff were attentive and friendly. There was nothing that they couldn't too. The free shuttle service to the shops was good to get some conveniences and exchange money. Exceeded our expectations and we can't wait to go back.\n"

                "\nLarge beach-side 5-star chain resort with very good children's club facilities and pleasant staff. Our daughter loved the kids club and did not want to come back to the room! And for that reason alone this proved to be a good hotel for our family in the Nusa Dua area. That said, the room was tight (Deluxe sea view), food was below expectation and the ambience was low-key in the evenings. However, with a little exploration around the area we could make the best of our time.",
                "Once we had enough of lying on the beach, we started exploring the locality. The hotel is situated inside a large area ear-marked for tourists by BTDC, the local tourism board. The infrastructure in this area is good, but does not reflect local culture and life. For all we knew, we could be somewhere in Dubai or Singapore!",
                "The saving grace are a bunch of reasonably good restaurants when one walks along the beach about 300m to the right of Westin. These are located right behind the 'Bali Collections' mall and can also be reached by the free shuttle service to the mall that operates from 10am till 10pm. We tried the 'Bebek Bengil' restaurant, which specialises in duck.",
                "The Bali Collections mall can keep you busy for half a day if you want to pick up souvenirs. They also sell many international fashion and sports brands at a reasonable price. If you are really interested in Balinese handicrafts or art and culture, the best place to visit is Ubud where the quality is far better and prices are more reasonable. There are a few restaurants in Bali Collections, but I found the quality inconsistent across the ones that I tried.",
                "Outside the BTDC area, the Uluwatu temple is a short cab ride away. Along the way there are beautiful cliffs and beaches that one can see. The best time to reach the temple is a couple of hours before sunset, when the Kecak Ramayana dance is performed by local artists in an open air amphitheatre against the backdrop of the temple on a cliff.",
                "Overall Nusa Dua is a pleasant destination with nice beaches, though a bit disappointing for those who would like to experience the Balinese life, history, art and culture. If one is looking for a totally relaxed beach holiday then it is not bad, although there are better places that fit the bill in surrounding Southeast Asia and elsewhere around the world. If one is visiting Bali for a taste of its rich history of art, culture, local food and lifestyle or even a bit of action then a far better place to visit is Ubud.\n"

                "\nWe stayed for one week for my older son's spring break. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet at Prego, one dinner at Ikan and a couple of in-room dinners. The most enjoyable part of the stay for the kids was looking for critters during low tide. We found plenty of crabs and fish, but also found starfish, sea slugs and a tiny squid. While the hotel was great, the most comforting part was that the hotel has a doctor on call 24 hours a day, which we had to use twice because my younger son fell ill due to food we had on one of our outings outside the hotel and an ear infection he developed. For the ear infection, we took my son to BIMC Hospital, which is a small but modern hospital with English-speaking doctors, nurses and staff, which is very close to the hotel. The Westin was great in helping us deal with these emergencies, booking cars to go to the hospital, getting a nanny for my older son while my wife and I took my younger son to the hospital. For families that may be worried about access to good medical care during their vacation, Westin Nusa Dua is definitely a great place to stay (notwithstanding all the other things they offer).\n"

The lovely open space in the lobby, the winding pools, the short walk to the stunning beach were all the same. What was even better was the new wing that had been added to the hotel, with modern rooms and a cosy, picturesque pool. All the restaurants, and especially the Italian restaurant (Prego) served phenomenal dishes and we were not tempted to leave the resort even for a single day. The staff were helpful as ever and we had the best 4-day vacation possible. Thanks to all the staff at the Westin for making this a memorable stay!\n"

                "\nI was there on business attending meetings. The resort is very much inside a compound that is only accessible through a guarded gate. Every car will be scanned on the way in by the security officers - which can be a bit of a nuisance. If you want to buy anything from a convenience store at night, there aren't any nearby. The closest mall is 2 km away or so called The Collection. Not many activities at the beach and very much a family resort - everything is quiet after 9 pm. I had a case of high fever and nausea on the day of my departure. I asked reception to arrange an on-call doctor. Doctor comes and performs a regular and quick checkup and hands me an invoice of 800,000 rupees. When I said I didn't have enough rupees and that I'd like to pay by credit card, he refused. So I proposed USD and he accepted. I handed him 100 USD expecting some change but never got anything. I feel I was ripped off and it was somehow facilitated through the hotel. Please make sure you're carrying enough medication with you especially if you're not into spicy food.\n"

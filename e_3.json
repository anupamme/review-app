With our luxury escapes deal we held our breath and closed our eyes. Our Palace Club suite was well appointed and we enjoyed having a bedroom to ourselves for once. the kids had their own beds and TV/dvd player for those nights after long days of swimming. The resort sits right on a clean and perfectly usable beach. At low tide the sea disappears but leaves a cool reef to explore. The pools suited our young kids (5&6). The hardest working staff on the resort are the pool cleaners, I saw one to submerged for the day fixing tiles and making sure the pool was spotless. The kids club was ok, but the kids didn't really seem to want to go back like in other resorts, it's an area that could be improved. The palace club serves great breakfasts, but the food seems to go downhill as the day goes on. The staff are so warm and polite in the palace club. If only all of the staff were as well versed in English this resort would be a true winner. It makes for a deeper knowledge of the local area or activities in the resort very challenging. Do not try and hire a paddle board, I ended up walking away in utter frustration with the staff member not caring at all. Overall the resort Has traditional bali charm but needs a small amount of work to bring it back to life, the food is hit(Japanese restaurant) and miss (checkers by the oceanfront). The food and day spa is soooooo overpriced, and if we didn't have vouchers from he holiday deal we would never have eaten or got a massage on site. A massage from the beach was $10, a massage in the spa was $65. A coke from the street was 70c, at the resort it was $4. It takes the gloss off an overall charming resort. I'm sure the new food and beverage manager will sort this out. Overall it's clean and relaxing and it never felt too busy, it has charm and a lil something about it. Just let it wash over y for the first few days and it will charm you by the end of your stay.\n", "\nDrinks are far too pricey.......12 canadian dollars for a gin and tonic.......over $4 for a bottle of water by the pool.......good yoga classes.......friendly staff.......good early bird special at Raja restaurant\n", "\nGood location, Nice staff and service, Rooms were clean !!!

This holiday i booked 2 times 3 nights here and both times it was a pleasure to stay in this beautiful hotel. I booked a club room so got some extras like breakfast a la carte, tea time, free cocktails in evening. The staff is very friendly and efficient, make you feel you are at home and help you in any way they can. The breakfast was a la carte as i said with also small buffet. Tea time at noon was a joy with drinks and some small bites. The free cocktails were enjoyable every time. Maybe compared with 3 yrs ago everything was a bit less but still ok and worth the extra money. The pools are great, sometimes a bit crowdy but Always found a seat next to pool. The beach is very nice and clean, you can even have lunch or dinner at the beach when you want. There are 4 restaurants in the hotel and they are all good. The food is good quality and places are clean. Didnt try the Spa this time but it was ok the first time and i didnt hear anyone complain. Checking out was the only negative thing i can think off, staff did a great job and was accurate. Maybe pay attention when you use the taxi counter, you can find cheaper ways. For the rest...i will be back..\n", "\nOur 6-Day Family Stay at the Nusa Dua Hotel & Spa can only be described in one word - \"Superb\"!

At the same time we were here, our daughter was staying at a #1 hotel in Legian. In spite of loyally choosing the same hotel for the last 4 years, she visited us at Nusa Dua Hotel Beach Hotel and Spar and decided that our hotel was the only place she wanted to return to! She was entirely awestruck by the beauty and luxury of the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa! But really, from my husband and I, this hotel, with its beautiful staff, is the best! We commend the following Staff : Waitresses, Werni, Ayu, Nona, Fedelia, Nofi, Ulan, Waiters, Gin, Sugiati, Wardan, Sedyana. Finally, what a wonderful housekeeper, Kastawar - dedicated to cleaning to the nth degree - never seen a housekeeper like him, scrupulous, trustworthy and so respectful. Chief Chef, Ian - wonderful human being and so dedicated, the food is of the highest quality and deliciously nutritious! As far as PR goes, you can't go past Ian and Bruce. Please, don't let these guys slip through the corporate fingers. We specifically want to say that Nona has been very helpful and pleasant to us, helping to solve minor problems, as has Fedelia in the past. We could go on. What a wonderful combination of people. So beautiful, we cant wait to return. So sad that we have to wait until next May! Hope they can accommodate us in a Palace Suite! .... So, if our message is any way ambiguous! What else can I say? Its in walking distance of a Bali Central and another number of resorts - all of them offer a variety of dining experience that we didn't have the need to try. The hotel has a variety of choices, but we have to admit, that we didn't venture further than Chess! We just didn't want for anything!\n", "\nBoth my husband and I enjoyed our spacious Palace Club Suite room. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The gardens were beautiful and serene. Loved the spa treatments. I would recommend it highly.", " ", "\n", "\nWonderful stay! We experienced everything and more at Nusa Dua Beach Resort and Spa!

", " ", "\n", "\nWe visited the resort in October 2013. It's a great hotel to just relax and laze around. Of our 5 day holiday, we spent 4 days entirely in the resort. We booked the palace club room which came with a lot of perks including evening cocktails and a separate breakfast buffet. If u r willing to spend a little extra, its totally worth the money to book the palace club rooms. We booked a couple's spa on the last day which was absolutely superb. It is definitely on the more expensive side, but saves u the time and effort to travel for a spa treatment. All in all a relaxing stay and great hospitality!\n", "\nPeople return to this hotel year after year and although this was our first visit, it will certainly not be our last. Whilst not the most contemporary or trendy resort in Nusa Dua, this hotel more than makes up for it with its lush gardens, beautiful pools, proximity to the beach and friendly helpful staff. We were visiting with our teenage daughters during the school holidays and whereas neighbouring resorts seemed to be much more crowded and overrun with young families, we never had the feeling that our hotel was busy, as there is so much space to spread out. The elegant pavilions, combined with traditional Balinese architecture and extensive grounds mean you can always find a quiet spot to relax and although the loungers by the pool are often reserved with towels by breakfast, there are plenty of loungers under shady umbrellas a minute away on the beach or by the stunning lap pool near the spa and tennis courts. Many people rave about the Palace Club but we booked the 8 night package which was great value. It includes an upgrade to Premier room, three dinners for two at the Balinese banquets, free cocktails, three spa treatments per person at the beautiful spa and free breakfasts every morning. The breakfasts offered so much choice with fresh juices, eggs and pancakes cooked to order and a huge buffet spread of fruits, pastries, cereals and other savouries that we never needed more than a smoothie or juice for lunch. The only negative was that the weekend we arrived the hotel was almost booked out with a big Japanese convention so we weren't upgraded for the first two nights and the first room smelled of smoke. Just speak to the rep at the Customer Relations desk and be very firm if you require a change of room and they will come eventually come through. As with most resorts, the taxi can be quite expensive if ordered from the front desk. We booked an fantastic private driver for day trips to Ubud, white water rafting and the Elephant Sanctuary. Jonto speaks excellent English and has a very comfortable 7 seater. Call him direct on +6281 338 532 873 or email: jonto57@yahoo.co.id He is from Ubud, is totally reliable and took us through the traditional villages and back roads to avoid the appalling Bali traffic.\n", "\nWe have been in your resort many times and have always been happy but this time we found not proper service and poor quality for restaurants meals. We were not being taken care of and not sure if we will ever return\n", "\nAfter staying at this hotel last year for 5 nights, we decided to have our wedding here (Sept. 2014), which was conducted in the quiet gardens of the hotel near the duck ponds. Our wedding co-ordinator Metalia looked after us from start to finish, and everything went off without a hitch! We combined our wedding and honeymoon (2 weeks), and once again enjoyed all the facilities of the hotel. The staff are always smiling and happy to help with anything you need. Our favourite squirrels came to visit every morning and afternoon to munch on snacks with us. Will be back soon!\n", "\nThis hotel is absolutely fabulous. The location is perfect- right on the beach ( also gorgeous!) with well furnished rooms and plenty of facilities. There are several bars / restaurants to choose from and the quality of food was great. Breakfast has everything you could think of and more and unlike some hotels, doesn't finish ridiculously early! All the staff we dealt with were so friendly and genuinely helpful. Some people have commented that sun beds all go around the pool, and yes this did happen, with people booking them early on but there were always plenty of sunbeds on the beach which was literally over the path from the hotel garden. There is only one really tiny negative thing I could think of ( just so it's doesn't read as too gushy!) and that is the Chess Restaurant could sometimes get really busy in the evenings and then the wait to get a menu, have order taken etc could be very long, but this only happened a couple of times so it wasn't that big an issue.", "We went on a couple of trips out, and the hotel will kindly book a taxi for you and you pay the hotel direct, which saves haggling, but you will pay over the odds for this, but these were small people carriers as opposed to minicabs. But very reliable service. Definitely worth a stay here!", "\n", "\nI booked Premier room and requested for high floor. Was very disappointed the the room I was given was on the ground floor.

While waiting at the check in counter, the only staff in attendance was busy handling a couple who may have made some request and took him a long time to handle. The next staff took quite a while to come out of the room behind to help with the booking, by then I have waited for more than 5 minutes. Luckily, the second person was very fast and professional in handling the booking and made me feel welcomed.

The staff in general were extremely friendly and nice but lacked basic comprehension if you wanted something. ", "Some things at the hotel make you scratch your head, for example the hotel has a great breakfast buffet spread, yet you have to scramble to find your own table, search to find your own high chair, you aren't offered any tea or coffee and if you aren't randomly asked halfway through your breakfast and ask a staff member, they seem confused and need to be asked 3 or 4 times before doing anything!", "Aside from this the facilities are very good, the kids club is tiny with quite boring and limited activities and from looking at nearby hotels their clubs seems much bigger and more fun, but the pool area was fantastic with a huge sandbank area for kids to play in and plenty of communal toys provided for kids of all ages.", "The location itself is fantastic, extremely secure and a world away from the likes of Kuta. 12 luxury hotels line up on a great beach front with a nice open plan shopping centre in the middle. ", "Overall a really nice place to bring the family for a week's break.\n", "\nI had before stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort in March when I attended a nearby conference and enjoyed the pools, rooms and laid back and friendly service although there was definite room for improvement.", "Yet, on returning this week with my husband I can still only give this hotel 4 stars because there are two many lapses in staff professionalism and the F&B offerings in the Palace Club fall short of what one expects from a 5-star hotel in Nusa Dua given the competition. I would be happy to liaise with the hotel directly in regard to my comments.\n", "\nStaff very friendly and helpful. The rooms were well presented with a late variety of TV channels. Even though it was a resort, I found the prices to be a little high on most food and beverage for my liking. 5 mins down the road we got a Bintang for 1.95 compared to 6.9 so that was annoying however, when staying in a resort one can expect prices to be higher.", "The pool areas were great. 1 suggestion I would say is there needed to be more free entertainment on nightly. I've travelled to Vanuatu a few times and at the resorts they have live bands and traditional dancing which was all free and would be a great addition to anyones stay at the resort.", "\n", "\nNusa Dua Beach H&S is the best hotel in the area. It is the one with more green areas and gardens and beautiful buganvilles, other hotels could get too crowded but in NDBHS you get enough privacy and quite space. The pool is just few meters away from the beach ( in other hotels pool is not so close). The second pool is PERFECT for the whole family to enjoy, specially if you have small kids. Staff couldnt be more attentive and child friendly. We had an amazing vacation and have no complain at all! Also, its architecture makes it the most unique hotel, if you want to feel you are in Bali, go to NDBHS, it is beautiful!!!\n", "\nStaff and overall experience was great as well as the spa. Restaurants were great and we had a wonderfull stay. If I have to mention anything negative I would say that the check-out could be faster.

The only facility we didn't use was the laundry. We dried things on the balcony! The breakfast buffet was to die for.

Fruit juices good, coffee good and teas strained and perfect. Forget toast and because although great marmalade and jams they have no idea of toast (unless you like conrete consistency). Cornflakes are good if you use the drawer and take out a large spoon, otherwise the wooden spoon provided provides one flake at a time. You then need to fill a glass with milk (at one drip per second) to take to your table to enable you to get some sugar on before the milk.

Rooms are spacious and luxurious, no comment on that!", "However, it's important to be aware of the fact that the prices for beverages and food as well as for the services (watersports, massages, organised trips) are just ridiculous and where actually insulting, having travelled around most of Bali and Java for 2 weeks before arriving at the hotel. You easily pay 3 euros for a simple coke, excluding the infamous '20% service charge and government tax'. Food is nice, but not worth the money. The solution? We rented a scooter for 2 days and went to the nearby town for diner (about 1/4th of the hotels price) and massages (300.000IRP for 2 massages, a manicure and pedicure while the hotel charges 550.000 for one) :-).

Thankfully they offer a small buffet at night instead of table service which works much better, especially because it so much busier now the staff can concentrate on their guests. However, that was until our last night when out of the blue they went back to table service which was a disaster.

The pools and Spa were excellent, although the lack of sun lounges poolside needs to be addressed, with guests \"reserving\" them early by placing towels and bags there.

Use Bluebird taxis as these are metered and it cost 90,000 IDR (5 quid) to get to Kuta. After visiting Kuta we could not wait to come back to the peace and nice surroundings of Nusa Dua.

The beach walk is impressive with a long strip of 5 star resorts and it has a nice relaxing feel. The beach is good when it is high tide but during low tide there is no chance to swim.

Great facilities especially the gym and pools. Great location with a short journey to some amazing restaurants in Tangung Benoa. Also a short walk to Bali Continental shopping centre and a $3 taxi journey to the local shopping market. The gardens are spectacular. Only 2 improvement points are that the FOH staff need to explain all the great facilities available to guests-like the jacuzzi, free shuttle etc on arrival and the theme dance/dinners need a synopsis at the start.

The resort has everything you need and its size makes it feel pleasantly uncrowded. The facilities were great and we enjoyed tennis, squash and the water activities. I was a little apprehensive that 2 teenagers might find Nusa Dua a little boring, but not so. It turned out to be a great break for them. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful with everything we needed. A cautionary note about arriving in Bali; we have always used the Visa Express service, however this is not available at the moment and our 1 hr 45 min journey through customs, with upwards of 2,000 other travellers was not a pleasant experience. The hotel staff were waiting for us when we cleared customs, so from that point on everything was wonderful.\n", "\nWe are currently staying at this hotel for 12 nights and can honestly say that up to this point our hotel experience has been fantastic.

Spa was well worth the visit. Our only problems were our airport transfer did not arrive and we had to make our own way to the hotel and the pools are lovely but because people put their towels out on the chairs really early in the morning and reserve them for the day, its impossible to get a chair after about 8.0 in the morning. This needs to be addresssed by the hotel as there would be enough to go around if they were controlled more effectively. The pool could be empty and you still can't get a chair as people leave their things there and then just come and go thru the day as they please. A lot of frustrated guests around the pool area.\n", "\nFor a hotel established in the 80's this place is certainly keeping up with the times while maintaining the traditional Balinese feel with amazing structures and gardens. Attentive and friendly staff, rooms in very good shape and an abundance of poolside and beachside areas we could not have been happier with our stay. Despite being quite busy, it never really felt crowded. Upgrade to the club area, it's worth it.

The bathroom itself is small and I was quite surprised that we had no bath tub in the room.The chairs outside on the balcony are also dirty with mould growing on the cushion seat covers. As we strolled down the long stretch of beach (Westin and Laguna by Westin were next door), I couldn't help but look on in envy of their resort facilities and rooms where our friends were staying. We also managed to visit Ayana and if Ayana in Jimbaran Bay is a five star resort, then Nusa Dua Beach hotel is a 3 star at best!\n", "\nWe stayed at the hotel for a week in August with my husband and two young kids and the hotel exceeded our expectations.", "The hotel was beautifully appointed, rooms and common areas were very clean and had an authentic Bali atmosphere.

One of the highlights of the hotel is the spa and we enjoyed very much our couples' massage in a cabin that is way better than anything I have seen in European spas. A suggestion for improvement would be to have a system allocating pool beds to everyone as it is a little annoying when people leave their towels to reserve pool beds from early morning until sunset.\n", "\nAlmost perfect, we had difficulty with wi fi and were a little disappointed it was not free.

It was $9.60 for a johnny walker & coke needless to say we didnt order one!! We had dinner at the chess restaraunt one night & the service was terrible & our order was incorrect & just for mains & a drink each it set us back over $120.

Games room was so far away in quiet spa area we didn't feel it was the best location. We were lucky enough to assist in baby turtle release on the beach. Amazing highlight. Thank you we will certainly return. The ladies at the spa were wonderful and our spa experience was one of the best I have had.\n", "\nWe really enjoyed our 8-days in the palace club.

For those who will have meeting in those two convention centers better stay in this hotel.

It was fine, but it would not rave about it. Breakfast buffet was ample with good quality. But, on the Saturday, we had to wait in line for 30+ minutes just to get a table. The crepe station always had a line and often ran out of toppings. Inadequate loungers around the pools meant that we often had to find somewhere else to hang out. The hotels are all right next to one another along the beach. We needed to do laundry and the prices were sky high, so we took our clothes out to a local laundry service that cost 1/10th of the price. Restaurant prices were very high ($75+ for two adults and two kids sharing burgers and water). Sure, the staff was friendly, but every time I turned around another expense was revealed. So, we went to the shopping center two miles away for most meals. The hotel was fine, not good, and I would definitely not spend my tourism dollars by going back. They gave coupons on arrival that we inevitably forgot to bring when we did eat in. The hotel refused to honor them at the end of our stay. All in all, it just left a bad taste in my mouth at a fairly high cost.\n", "\nIn line with our expectations, we've been there 23y ago on honeymoon and we still found a very reputable and excellent hotel; of course years passed by for everybody, but Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is still in a very good shape.

We stayed for a week in there for our honeymoon, and was really looking forward to the experience in the beginning. We chose Nusa Dua Beach Hotel because we saw a lot of good comments about it and we thought we would love to try. It was a bit disappointing in the end, we had to wait for a while for check-in, the food wasn't that great, the service at the restaurants was poor (not enough staff to serve all the guests), not enough pool chairs and everybody seems to come very early in the morning to book the chairs yet it says that you can not pre-booked pool chair on the sign. There are few other problems that we encounter while staying in there.

The hotel is situated away from the more busy areas of Bali (Kuta), to the South of the Island in a more quite section. Being a small island there is no train / tram / metro service...all public transport is by bus, but as taxi's are reasonably cheap tourist just use them. The whole Nusa Dua area is closed off to give a nice sense of security and seclusion. The beaches are wonderful, golden sand and clear water. There is a shopping centre about 10 mins walk from the hotel which has plenty of shops and eateries. Look out for the offers on massages...you can get a 1 hour foot massage for the equivalent of \u00a37! The price of food in the shopping centre restaurants is slightly cheaper than the hotel...but in terms of choice, you don't have the variety IMHO. There is a shuttle bus to a shopping centre, however its only a short walk and the way the bus picks up and drops off at every hotel, by walking you can nearly beat it to the shopping centre on some occasions. There are also a few local shops around which are great for souvenirs such as wood carvings. I found these to be cheaper than the ones in more touristy areas of Ubud.", "Food: We paid for the breakfast for our stay. The breakfast is very good. Some Danish pastries, pan au chocolat, muffins etc. The hot breakfast was average...Scrambled eggs, sausages, mushrooms, hash-browns, bacon, toast, beans. But not fried mushrooms....& not many veggie options such as veggie sausages. The cereal choice was poor though...only 3 choices rather than packets of the Kelloggs variety packs you normally get in good hotels. There were also lots of fresh juices, meats, fruit and yoghurt. We did have dinner a few times in the various restaurants in the hotel, the food is quite good, but a little pricey, in that is costs the same for as it would in the UK. I think the hotel realises this and supplies money off vouchers for every \u00a310 you spend, however this only get you \u00a32.50 off. The hotel restaurants do have good variety and sometimes entertainments such as singers and bands. Plus as you can walk down the beach path to other hotels, you are only a short walk away from lots of other restaurants, some better / cheaper than this hotels, some not. ", "Room: The room was an average size, clean and tidy with a small balcony, small bathroom, shower but no bath. The bed was large. The TV was flat screen however if it doesn't have any USB ports...which would have been nice as we bought a USB key along to watch some films. For English speakers, your limited to news channels and a few movie channels. There is a kettle for tea/coffee & you receive 2 bottles of water per day which is a nice touch. The room has a standard safe and mini-bar, iron and ironing-board & is air conditioned.", "Spa & beach area: There's a Spa adjacent to the hotel, we never used this so can't comment on it. The hotel has 2 large pools and a few smaller ones. The is a bit of a rush of sunbeds between 11am - 2pm so sometimes you can end up on the beach without one. Easy to walk up the beach to other (and cheaper) restaurants.", "Staff: Front desk staff are very good and were helpful, i.e. transport, attractions to see etc. They told us about the WIFI throughout the hotel which costs to use in your room or is free in the lobby where you can also use the hotels desktop computers. (maybe this could be included in the room rate as many other hotels offer Wifi for free???). There are about 4 people that are on the front desk and i can only say good things about them, Many as expected are multi-lingual, speaking English ...so no issues with asking for anything. I was very grateful to them when they helped out with questions about transport and local amenities.", "Misc: Be warned that when you get off the flight and before collecting your luggage you have to pay $35 each for a enrty VISA and then queue for about hour through customs....a long time after a long flight. :( There is a taxi counter after baggage collection...a FAIR price for a taxi to the hotel is around 150,000 rupiah. Nearly EVERYWHERE in Bali you can haggle for the cost...so go ahead and try it....i think the sellers half expect it so always quote you a price double what they expect, knowing you will haggle some money off. Everywhere in Bali, you will get locals trying to sell you things. A quite \"No Thanks\" usually suffices and you are left alone. Never ever fall for some of the cons though where you get into a conversation and eventually asked \"What is you program for tomorrow?\". Basically the seller will offer a deal to take you to X, Y, Z....best to not do this even if it sounds cheap...make all bookings through your hotel. Another con we found in the shopping centre is being approached by sellers telling you about a new hotel (the best in Bali apparently ;) ) that they are advertising. You are handed 2 vouchers and after more advertising chatter are told to open the vouchers up and low-&-behold, you have won a FREE trip to the hotel for a 3 night stay and sometimes even a cash reward of $X.

We booked a deal and upgraded our package to the Club which was excellent value. We had our two boys in our room in rollaway beds but we had a seperate living area for after hours which worked so well. The Club package opened up the ability for afternoon tea refreshments which allowed us to have a few snacks with the kids before bed. The evening cocktails were great, especially given our central location. The team were very tolerant in us having some of the cocktails closer to our room after they had gone to bed. Breakfast was amazing for Bali standard. The pool and facilities are great as is the spa, which included some treatments in our package. Being a runner the beach trail was also very handy", "We met the whole management team as well who were very friendly.", "Some small negatives. The kids club was not very entertaining for the kids. They only only went a couple of times and really didn't want to go back. If any deal offers fast track through the airport (immigation) then forget it.

Activities if you are interested. On the beach, extensive pools, enough sun lounges, food on call everywhere, magnificent breakfasts. Easy to walk up the beach to other (and cheaper) restaurants. Our deal included some meals to match their special entertainment nights which were buffets. There is a shuttle bus to a shopping centre which is like a mall, but if you wanted a more Balinese shopping experience you can walk out the front of the resort and pick up a cheap taxi ride.

I can truly say our whole family had no complaints.\n", "\nthe hotel is elegant and tranquil for couple of nights we spent there at the end of our holiday... the rooms are beautifully designed and the staff were very friendly and helpful. i particulary enoyed the large pool to thoug access to the very beautiful beach is just as conveniet. we ate at their restaurant on the 1st night and the food was so delicious and service attentive. all i can say.. that was wonderful stay.. thank you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa!\n", "\nGreat hotel, very helpful and friendly staff.

The breakfast was a real hit with the buffet as the older two are boys and they eat a lot! We were able to skip lunch most days because of the big breakfasts.

The many resuaturants inside the resort also catered for Coeliacs which is surprising, just triple check with the head chef as their understanding of gluten is limited.", "The resorts main pool is small in comparison to other resorts which have mutliple pools, but nevertheless suitable.

You are limited to the resorts so prices are a little more. There is a FREE shuttle bus that collects you from your hotel to take you to Bali Collection Shopping (Outdoor) Centre which also has restuarants and a mini supermarket. Again, prices are higher than in Kuta where a Circle K is on every corner! If you are in Kuta, go to Circle K and stock up and save some money.

Second time round the hotel didn't seem as 'heavenly' but that could have been because it wasn't a novelty any more. However, we asked for and were granted a room change because the bathroom of the first room allocated to us was quite unsatisfactory --- small, no bath tub, shower with only a half door so the water would just splash all over the floor and the unhygienic situation of the toilet being in close proximity to the wash basin and towels. ", "The second room was a bit better but really, only just. It had a bath tub but the shower was in the tub when we were expecting a separate shower; the latter I may say is usually the norm for 5 star hotels, at least in Asia it is. The room was on the 4th floor and was so far away from reception that it was a real bind having to take so long to get there. ", "But the staff were their usual extremely friendly and obliging selves and room service was prompt. ", "The hotel could do with some decent musical entertainment in the evenings. They had a female pianist for a couple of evenings a week whose singing and playing was positively soporific. I'm not surprised that the lounge bar was so poorly attended. When will hotel managers grasp the importance of decent, live music to attract guests to the area, set an appropriate mood and thereby increase bar takings?

Checkers restaurant is lovely for dinner. We had a table right on the grass so the kids could run around while we finished up or listened to the band.", "We used the hotel taxi to go into Kuta/ Seminyak. We took the three hour option.

Other guests we spoke to used the taxis outside the hotel gates we probably would to but didn't want to walk all that way ( entrance to hotel is a long road) with the two small children.", "The only issue for our stay were the sun loungers at the pool area. Other guests would put towels on them early in the morning then only come back in the afternoon. Or only use them for an hour or so in the morning then leave their towels and come back in the afternoon for another hour or so. It makes it difficult for those of us with small children trying to find a shady place to sit. Or indeed all guests trying to use the pool facilities.

Unfortunately, I booked a room that was not as nice as the first time around. I booked a premium room with a great pool view but these rooms don't seem to be as well kept as the higher priced rooms. The bathroom could have used a good bleach scrub down and the house keeping didn't do the best job with the daily cleanings.

Another irritation was the shower stall do not have a door and subsequently the bathroom floor is always wet after a shower.

The bed was really comfortable, storage plentiful and the marble bathroom a good size (although I did think it was the one thing that was looking a little tired and dated).", "The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, with tropical plants, ponds, statues and carved stonework all adding to the Balinese ambiance.

I enjoyed the more \"international\" clientelle, a welcome change from the Aussies we normally encounter in Kuta. The breakfast buffet was fabulous. Was expecting to have water sports available to use, so was a little disappointed at this aspect. Also, the lack of a DVD player in the family room was a bit of a let down considering this is when my husband and I get \"down time\" from our active kids.

Overall, a wonderful trip.\n", "\nNice estate and gardens, on the beach, great facilities and good food at different restaurants.", "One remark, given the size this resort is more suitable for families and children then couples. Other than that a nice allround resort.\n", "\nI'm really surprised at the glowing positive reviews for this place as we felt it was just OK. We got 2 adjoining ground floor rooms for a great price. BUT...the food was extremely variable, except for breakfast which was reasonable. The service was poor, especially around the pool, where the staff have limited English. Although I talked as clearly and slowly as I could, and they repeated it back, they still stuffed up our order every single time! It was difficult to feed fussy kids because the staff had limited flexibility. Eg the Italian restaurant would not do spaghetti bolognese! The best food we had was room service. The beds were squeaky, hard and uncomfortable. Our room which faced the garden was dark and smelt dank and unpleasant. The aircon thermostat didn't work properly. The best thing about the hotel was kids club where the staff organised great activities like kite-making and flying. The spa was also lovely and the massages on the beach were good too.\n", "\nThe resort is rustic in line with Balinese culture. The service and amenities are great. Kid friendly with appropriate pools. The proximity to other resorts provides choice of food. Beach is coral lined thus limited for swimming unlike Seminyak. Overall recommend and would visit again.\n", "\nFor a comparatively inexpensive Nusa Dua resort this hotel really delivers. The new tollway from the airport really impressed. No more traffic jams and an enjoyable 15 minute taxi fare from the refurbished airport saw us to the hotel. It's an easy stroll to the Bali Collection but the hotel restaurants are well priced ( for food) and great quality. The room was neat but the floors was slippery and the shower blocked up. The room overlooked beautiful gardens and overall I would say I was very happy with my week at this hotel.\n", "\nThis hotel is fantastic. The grounds, pools, restaurants and rooms are wonderful, but most of all the staff are an absolute delight.
